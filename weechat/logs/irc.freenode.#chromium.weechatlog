2016-09-12 16:17:26	keveloper	How chrome know not to save JS redirects to its history? Is there a time interval minimum to save to history or something?

2016-09-12 16:21:19	keveloper	So we're having this issue in Firefox where the back button will take you to a page that was automatically navigated away from (not what we want). But Chrome, Safari, and IE, all don't save the page in their history...
2016-09-12 16:22:45	keveloper	So I was just wondering if anyone knew what the other browsers (including Chrome) do to detect things like this, because apparently FF does not. Thanks ellyjones
