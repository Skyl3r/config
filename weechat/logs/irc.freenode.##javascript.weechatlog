2017-01-03 11:48:14	Rashad	Hello. I have the following problem: I am using vuejs with vuex to maintain my app's state. Basically, you get a state object that stores the state of the app. I want also to maintain a subset of the state in localStorage. Now, whenever one tab changes localStorage, I listen to the changes in the other tabs and use the new data to sync the state between all tabs.

2017-01-03 11:49:20	Rashad	My problem is that, in some scenarios, I want to do something at the server when the state changes. Here is an example: tab1 logs in, updates localStorage, tab2 detects the change, extracts the access token from the new localStorage data, then logs in at the server with the token.

2017-01-03 11:50:26	Rashad	So basically I fire an event "login" and supply a payload with the token.

2017-01-03 12:27:03	fuchstronaut	I want to dynamically add a striped background to an SVG element (via JavaScript). It seems like CSS3's linear-gradient has no effect. any hints?ß
2017-01-03 12:27:09	joeytwiddle	the common implementation of debounce takes a function and returns you a new function: a debounced version of the one you gave it

2017-01-03 12:27:36	joeytwiddle	so an alternative way would be to create a separate debounced function for each id, and call the right function for the right id
2017-01-03 12:28:06	joeytwiddle	you could store each function directly on the element, or again in a map[id] but this time outside of the debounce code
