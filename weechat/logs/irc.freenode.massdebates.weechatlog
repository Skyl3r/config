2017-10-12 14:52:06	keveloper	I helped him with something by making a codepen
2017-10-12 14:52:18	keveloper	and he went to my codepen profile and found my portfolio then found pernt lol

2017-10-12 14:52:41	MassDebates	I'm a Marketer
2017-10-12 14:52:51	MassDebates	I'm not a designer. I know some design stuff and I _can_ design stuff
2017-10-12 14:53:24	MassDebates	Neat stuff.
2017-10-12 14:53:27	MassDebates	Capital University
2017-10-12 14:53:30	MassDebates	I went to Niagara University
2017-10-12 14:53:32	MassDebates	wayyy long ago
2017-10-12 14:53:54	keveloper	Dunno what that is
2017-10-12 14:54:20	MassDebates	Just another school.
2017-10-12 14:54:25	MassDebates	Site's decent
2017-10-12 14:54:29	MassDebates	But why don't you market yourself?
2017-10-12 14:54:39	keveloper	Like how?
2017-10-12 14:54:49	keveloper	(am i not?) :|
2017-10-12 14:54:49	MassDebates	Hm, well
2017-10-12 14:54:50	keveloper	lol
2017-10-12 14:54:54	MassDebates	Let me ask you a couple questions
2017-10-12 14:54:56	keveloper	ok
2017-10-12 14:55:02	MassDebates	You use Google Analytics, yes?
2017-10-12 14:55:10	keveloper	no i do not lol
2017-10-12 14:55:20	MassDebates	Why not?
2017-10-12 14:55:40	keveloper	uhh idk no reason i guess lol
2017-10-12 14:56:41	MassDebates	Are you saying that if you were using analytics you wouldn't be any better off
2017-10-12 14:56:42	MassDebates	?
2017-10-12 14:57:04	MassDebates	Or, would you know how to use it for actual benefit? Like actionable insights?
2017-10-12 15:01:23	keveloper	I've thought about setting it up a few times
2017-10-12 15:01:51	MassDebates	How many leads do you get through the site?
2017-10-12 15:02:13	keveloper	0 lol
2017-10-12 15:02:28	keveloper	it was mainly for practice but trying to put it use now
2017-10-12 15:03:31	MassDebates	What about google search console?
2017-10-12 15:04:02	MassDebates	I think that you're sacrificing one of the best projects a developer gets to work on, especially a full stack developer like yourself - Their Own!
2017-10-12 15:04:22	MassDebates	This is something where you can really do what you want. No scope or limitation by a client.
2017-10-12 15:04:30	MassDebates	I love seeing a developer who really takes passion into their site.
2017-10-12 15:04:36	MassDebates	Don't get me wrong, I think this nice and all, but...
2017-10-12 15:04:39	MassDebates	I wasn't driven to fill out the contact form.
2017-10-12 15:04:47	MassDebates	At the end of the day, that's why the site exists, no?
2017-10-12 15:04:50	MassDebates	Or is this a business card?
2017-10-12 15:05:11	MassDebates	At any rate, if it is a business card, I would still say it's not doing the job. I once dropped a business card at a bar a few months before I got a random call.
2017-10-12 15:05:22	MassDebates	That random call was from nettina and I got a really nice gig from it
2017-10-12 15:05:34	MassDebates	Still collect from him today, doing hosting, redesigns, and consultations.
2017-10-12 15:05:53	MassDebates	I've been doing work with him for years now. The business card did it's job
2017-10-12 15:05:59	MassDebates	its job*
2017-10-12 16:07:14	MassDebates	hey, quick question
2017-10-12 16:07:23	MassDebates	Have you designed any mobile apps?
2017-10-12 16:43:28	keveloper	Sorry I was in meeting
2017-10-12 16:43:33	keveloper	In college but not since
2017-10-12 16:43:42	keveloper	Reading up now
2017-10-12 16:44:26	keveloper	Yeah to be honest it was mostly to practice design from scratch with no frameworks
2017-10-12 16:44:34	keveloper	And also to advertise my abilities
2017-10-12 16:44:49	keveloper	I don't really know anything about GA or google search console (idk what that is at all)
