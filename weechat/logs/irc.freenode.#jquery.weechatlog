2017-03-16 11:06:35	JuJUBee	taplar, was trying to diagnose an issue with script working in FF and Chromium but not in Chrome earlier with Cork
2017-03-16 11:06:47	taplar	you are using version 1.9.1 on your site?
2017-03-16 11:07:00	JuJUBee	taplar, minimized the code to jsfiddle to test
2017-03-16 11:07:11	JuJUBee	yes
2017-03-16 11:07:17	JuJUBee	for now
2017-03-16 11:07:22	taplar	how are you running the script on your site?
2017-03-16 11:07:30	JuJUBee	what do you mean?
2017-03-16 11:07:45	taplar	in your head, body, is it in a doc ready, etc ?

2017-03-16 11:08:43	JuJUBee	static
2017-03-16 11:09:01	taplar	any console errors?
2017-03-16 11:09:01	JuJUBee	as in I created it and it gets its list from a db query

2017-03-16 11:09:40	JuJUBee	not put into source via ajax
2017-03-16 11:09:41	taplar	is it in the markup, or is it generated by javascript after page load?
2017-03-16 11:09:46	JuJUBee	markup
2017-03-16 11:09:49	taplar	k
2017-03-16 11:09:57	JuJUBee	sorry, im not a programmer, I teach networking
2017-03-16 11:10:15	taplar	in that case i'd have to see it failing cause what you have in the fiddle and what you said sound fine.
2017-03-16 11:10:28	taplar	have you tried logging the selector before you bind on the element?
2017-03-16 11:10:43	JuJUBee	What I have in the fiddle is not working in browser locally
2017-03-16 11:11:17	taplar	https://jsfiddle.net/qbLqL74m/1/  try that and see what if anything logs

2017-03-16 11:19:11	JuJUBee	So when I apply the 1.9.1 to my live site, it throws error cause I am using jquery.validationEngine  ... jquery.validationEngine.js:28 Uncaught TypeError: $(...).live is not a function
2017-03-16 11:19:34	taplar	iirc live() was deprecated in some version
2017-03-16 11:20:01	taplar	yeah, deprecated in 1.7, removed in 1.9
2017-03-16 11:20:30	taplar	so you'll need to either update the validationEngine to a newer version possibly, or use a jquery version prior to 1.9
2017-03-16 11:21:03	JuJUBee	I was using 1.6.3 and that is when I noticed this problem, so I loaded 1.9.1
2017-03-16 11:21:17	taplar	wow, that plugin is super old
2017-03-16 11:21:39	taplar	wait, no, last updated dec last year, so ok
2017-03-16 11:22:30	taplar	so yeah, you should consider updating that plugin
