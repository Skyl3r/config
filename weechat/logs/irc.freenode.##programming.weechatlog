2016-11-08 15:43:13	sbrg	so your error is somewhere else
2016-11-08 15:43:26	Beleiber97	sbrg then maybe this error is becasue i compile with c++11 on my own system=
2016-11-08 15:43:29	sbrg	this is why I asked for an example which you had confirmed demonstrated the error that you are getting.

2016-11-09 09:22:37	Taelia_	I-- I'd better do my own research :p I think I'm getting mixed signals.
2016-11-09 09:22:39	+vendu	rindolf, i have, but i have visions
2016-11-09 09:22:42	Taelia_	Thanks for the explanations.
2016-11-09 09:22:48	+vendu	rindolf, some of which would run in millions
2016-11-09 09:22:54	+vendu	so i need to think about stuff :)
2016-11-09 09:23:21	kadoban	Taelia_: deniska is just being pedantic. Python has what you'd almost certainly be thinking of as includes.
2016-11-09 09:23:31	+vendu	if i'm gonna break it into a millionaire, one of the first things to do would be buying a hackerspace downtown amsterdam :)
2016-11-09 09:23:49	deniska	Taelia_: if you don't mind long youtube videos, here's a pretty extensive one on that subject: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oTh1CXRaQ0

2017-09-28 10:39:17	Saiyyan	relatively easier language*

2017-09-28 10:40:36	Saiyyan	wedr_ google is free :D
2017-09-28 10:40:43	LastTalon	keveloper, go ahead.
2017-09-28 10:41:17	keveloper	So let's say you have function square(x) { ... }, the range of acceptable inputs is -infinity to infinity, but to prove correctness you only need 3 cases: a negative number, 0, and a positive number. Each of those groups of inputs has a name and I can't remember
2017-09-28 10:41:20	grouse	wedr_, C is a high level programming language in some circles. it's relative
2017-09-28 10:41:28	keveloper	Something along the lines of: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_finite_simple_groups
2017-09-28 10:41:41	merijn	keveloper: eh...wut..that's not enough to prove correctness

2017-09-28 10:42:41	benny-innofaith	I wonder how much entropy a google search generates. Or a car ride for that matter.
2017-09-28 10:42:43	keveloper	It's something like "___ class" or something and I cannot remember :O
2017-09-28 10:42:44	Saiyyan	I just meant that python and C# are easier than C++
2017-09-28 10:43:03	grouse	Saiyyan, easier in what way
2017-09-28 10:43:30	rindolf	keveloper: domain?
2017-09-28 10:43:47	benny-innofaith	Oh my. Someone also wondered this: https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/2y1tl6/request_entropy_of_one_google_search/

2017-09-28 10:44:29	rindolf	Saiyyan: you should learn python before jumping into c++ imo
2017-09-28 10:44:37	rindolf	keveloper: input?
2017-09-28 10:44:37	mrig	graff: That is a really interesting point that you raise, effectively; If you can no longer trust video footage of people, because this can be done, the media sort of looses its relevance, this has already happened in the case of photos.

2017-09-28 10:46:02	mrig	rindolf I learned about the python decorator the other day, I thought it was pretty interesting as it mirrors the way that I like to code with c.
2017-09-28 10:46:07	keveloper	Apparently not a commonly taught term
2017-09-28 10:46:08	grouse	Saiyyan, fair enough
2017-09-28 10:46:17	rindolf	mrig: i see
2017-09-28 10:46:23	grouse	Saiyyan, I've only been a beginner once and I started with java and C++, so I couldn't say ;)
2017-09-28 10:46:35	wedr_	That's not beginning.
2017-09-28 10:46:38	wedr_	beginner*
