2017-07-17 16:01:20	keveloper	trying to resist headbobbing at work
2017-08-16 15:21:55	keveloper	newest remix is looking like a failure :'( probably won't even release it haha
2017-08-17 00:42:05	--	irc: disconnected from server
2017-08-23 10:25:28	GothAlice	https://clyp.it/zmfomwgy — still need to clean up the last third, but I fixed the hammer-ons, at least!
2017-08-23 10:26:00	GothAlice	That was the "important" one; the others recently linked were a dulcimer and flute track (Ultima 6), and the wubstep playground I distinctly remember you seeing.
2017-08-23 10:26:03	keveloper	ah okay I had that in scrollback nevermind :D
2017-08-23 10:26:24	keveloper	other one from scrollback was a 404 so
2017-08-23 10:26:41	keveloper	what daw do you use
2017-08-23 10:26:51	GothAlice	Logic, of course.  ;^P
2017-08-23 10:26:53	keveloper	Ah right
2017-08-23 10:27:09	keveloper	trying to convince myself to do the FL Studio signature/komplete 11 thing
2017-08-23 10:27:37	GothAlice	Komplete is awesome.
2017-08-23 10:27:41	GothAlice	Can't deny that.
2017-08-23 10:27:45	keveloper	do you have it?
2017-08-23 10:27:57	GothAlice	I do; works with Logic quite well via the AudioUnit interface.  ;)
2017-08-23 10:28:02	keveloper	hows massive
2017-08-23 10:28:31	GothAlice	Also great.  Both sets come with so many pre-made patches that you'll get lost just plinking away on a MIDI controller for a few hours.  XP
2017-08-23 10:28:42	keveloper	always fun :P
2017-08-23 10:28:52	keveloper	komplete includes an audio library right?
2017-08-23 10:29:09	GothAlice	Aye, categorized and tagged for quick searching.
2017-08-23 10:29:14	keveloper	cool
2017-08-23 10:29:31	keveloper	Oh ultimate is only $1200 omw
2017-08-23 10:30:40	keveloper	I am confused
2017-08-23 10:30:50	GothAlice	?
2017-08-23 10:31:03	keveloper	Ohhh komplete 11 select is less than komplete 11
2017-08-23 10:31:20	keveloper	because kompelte 11 is $600
2017-08-23 10:38:05	keveloper	holy shit, the full version of komplete 11 (not even ultimate) is 155gb lol
2017-08-23 10:38:33	GothAlice	Do not underestimate the power of Komplete.
2017-08-23 10:38:39	GothAlice	Yes, it's _friggin' nuts_.  ;P
2017-08-23 10:38:47	keveloper	do you have the full version or select?
2017-08-23 10:38:53	keveloper	i.e. did you pay $200 or $600 lol
2017-08-23 10:38:58	GothAlice	Full, though old.  Version 9?
2017-08-23 10:39:04	keveloper	Ah okay
2017-08-23 10:39:23	keveloper	NI's new synth "Form" looks cool
2017-08-23 10:40:58	GothAlice	Made some Apple Store employee's day in Texas one time.  Walk in, "So, I notice your Logic Studio DVD box sets on the shelves are empty, and I want one."  "Oh!  I'll be right back!"  *comes back with a real $600 box set*  "Is there anything else you need?"  "Yeah, 16GB of DDR3 for a MacBook Pro."  *his face can't even*  "I'll be right back! … Anything else?"  "Yeah, I notice you have Komplete boxed sets…"  *his face can't even, even
2017-08-23 10:40:58	GothAlice	 more*
2017-08-23 10:41:36	keveloper	lollll
2017-08-23 10:43:29	keveloper	I'd love to go drop $1500 on audio stuff right now 
2017-08-23 10:46:43	keveloper	I don't wanna work now I just wanna spend 8 hours messing with new synths
2017-08-23 10:52:41	GothAlice	Hehehehe, yeah, I spent a week of free time just trying out all of the presets and groking the control interface through them.  (I'm a reverse-engineer learner.)
2017-08-23 10:52:42	keveloper	Do you use reaktor prism
2017-08-23 10:52:49	GothAlice	Alas, no.
2017-08-23 10:53:02	keveloper	Did it not exist when you bought it or you dont use it?
2017-08-23 10:53:11	GothAlice	Don't think it existed back then.  ;P
2017-08-23 10:53:42	GothAlice	Reaktor itself was included in the set I bought as the "host program" running their own plugins, which the AU would talk to from Logic.
2017-08-23 10:56:19	keveloper	Ah okay
2017-08-23 10:56:34	keveloper	I'm looking at all the synths and listening to the demos I need to buy this
2017-08-23 10:57:05	keveloper	Plus all of the FL Studio synths I get with the DAW :D
2017-08-23 10:58:07	keveloper	omg they remade a bunch of 80s song for one of the synth demos lol
2017-08-23 10:58:34	GothAlice	That's something that I've always found curious; the distinction between synth (sound generator accepting MIDI input) and preset / patch.  Logic comes with a half dozen synths and a reasonable ton of patches, but predominantly three synths are used.  ES2 is a three-generator three-oscilator sampling synth and really covers nearly every base.
2017-08-23 10:59:13	GothAlice	And now there's Alchemy.  Alchemy _literally_ covers every base.
2017-08-23 11:00:25	keveloper	Wonder if I could convince myself to get the full komplete
2017-08-23 11:01:57	GothAlice	(Alchemy in Logic is the reason why I never bothered updating my Komplete set… ;)
2017-08-23 11:04:33	keveloper	Hm that must have been after I bought logic
2017-08-23 11:05:37	GothAlice	Yeah, came with the transition to the App Store, I believe.
2017-08-23 11:05:41	keveloper	I own logic pro x though I wonder if I could update and get it :D
2017-08-23 11:05:48	keveloper	I don't have a good mac to produce on though
2017-08-23 11:06:00	GothAlice	Install it, open the app store, check for updates, you get updates and it'll now be registered against your Apple ID as a purchase.  ;)
2017-08-23 11:06:13	GothAlice	<3 Apple's old-software-update process.
2017-08-23 11:06:35	GothAlice	Same for Apple Remote Desktop and other things that used to be distributed on CD/DVD.
2017-08-23 11:06:37	keveloper	I bought it on the app store in the first place lol
2017-08-23 11:06:44	GothAlice	Well, that's easier!
2017-08-23 11:06:46	GothAlice	XP
2017-08-23 11:06:48	keveloper	:P
2017-08-23 11:06:58	keveloper	My late 2011 mbp would not be able to handle it these days
2017-08-23 11:07:16	GothAlice	Isn't that what track freezing is for?  ;^P
2017-08-23 11:07:25	keveloper	Ha I suppose :P
2017-08-23 11:08:16	GothAlice	I produce at 24-bit 96KHz with my Alchemy synth quality (bit accuracy) settings set to "ultimate".  It struggles like nobody's business rendering more than a few of those at a time.  Freeze ahoy!  ^_^
2017-08-23 11:09:10	keveloper	Yeah my newest remix (that I'm probably going to throw out because its bleh) is at 49 tracks right (36 ish) synths and I have not frozen yet lol
2017-08-23 11:09:24	keveloper	That's on my desktop though which is pretty sufficient
2017-08-23 11:09:47	keveloper	CPU use is at like 97% while playing
2017-08-23 11:10:51	GothAlice	Lower frequency rates greatly reduce CPU use, for obv. samples/second reasons.
2017-08-23 11:12:43	keveloper	aghhhh i might buy FL Studio/komplete next week I might do it
2017-08-23 11:13:00	keveloper	Getting FTE/freelance checks this weekend :D
2017-08-23 11:13:17	GothAlice	My recommendation is: do it without regret if you can accept the financial hit, otherwise pay it no mind.
2017-08-23 11:13:31	keveloper	I can accept the financial hit lol
2017-08-23 11:13:48	keveloper	I have big car plans though in 2 years so I'm trying to save so that it doesn't affect me as much lol
2017-08-23 11:13:49	GothAlice	Well there you go.  You'll get hundreds of hours of entertainment and thousands of hours of use out of it, easily.
2017-08-23 11:13:54	GothAlice	Is gud produkt.
2017-08-23 11:14:20	keveloper	Definitely not getting the full komplete set bu, I will get select
2017-08-23 11:33:48	GothAlice	Speaking of App Store upgrades of previously purchased software, Apple just sent me an e-mail to remind me that some of the apps I'm using from Final Cut Studio (pre-appstore) won't be compatible with High Sierra.  Wow, that's service.
2017-08-23 11:34:27	keveloper	jeez how much have you spent on media production software :P
2017-08-23 11:34:36	GothAlice	I produce all the media, so all the money.  ;P
2017-08-23 11:35:19	GothAlice	(Notably, I use the crap out of Compressor to encode client videos for the web.)
2017-08-23 11:38:29	GothAlice	And occasionally dabble with non-linear editing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqudtctOcdU
2017-08-23 11:40:18	GothAlice	Or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxQaXi-qiSY for a more EVE-general promo.  ;P
2017-08-23 11:42:19	keveloper	are you good at eve
2017-08-23 11:42:51	GothAlice	Heh; somewhat.  Skilled into every carrier in the game one day and was like, welp, time to win EVE.
2017-08-23 11:43:10	GothAlice	(The joke being, to win EVE you stop playing.)
2017-08-23 11:43:27	keveloper	Yeah I've heard it's basically a career lol
2017-08-23 11:43:48	GothAlice	And highschool drama/cliques.
2017-08-23 11:44:10	keveloper	Sounds like the rocket league pro scene lol
2017-08-23 11:44:17	keveloper	Super fun to watch, but don't try to follow the scene :P
2017-08-23 11:44:18	GothAlice	Except with 100% more long-duration drudgery.
2017-08-23 11:44:28	GothAlice	Building a carrier takes a legit month.
2017-08-23 11:44:32	GothAlice	Building a titan takes three.
2017-08-23 11:44:56	keveloper	isn't eve the game where some clan robbed another of like $20k of things
2017-08-23 11:45:01	keveloper	like of actual USD value
2017-08-23 11:45:22	GothAlice	Or in one battle, the combined losses on both sides (due literally to clicking the wrong button) exceeding that, yeah.
2017-08-23 11:45:39	GothAlice	My god, the guy that jumped his titan instead of bridging his teammates… lives in infamy.
2017-08-23 11:46:09	GothAlice	The enemies at the destination were like, "what in the actual fuck, get point on that thing!"  XD
2017-08-23 11:46:17	GothAlice	(Point = lock down from jumping.)
2017-08-23 11:47:38	GothAlice	I had the joy of participating as a bomber in the Of SOUND Mind schism during the Bend The Knee campaign.  Basically, they weren't going to get bullied out of an area of space without making the journey extremely expensive for their former landlords.  ;P
2017-08-23 11:47:58	GothAlice	(For refusing to "bend their knee" to them.)
2017-08-23 11:48:46	keveloper	Exactly the types of things I would expect to hear about eve lol
2017-08-23 11:48:50	keveloper	That game is actually insane
2017-08-23 11:50:14	GothAlice	Yes.
2017-08-23 11:50:39	GothAlice	I was head diplomat of the BRAVE group mentioned in my promo videos for a year and a half.  Diplomacy also covers spycraft.  ;P
2017-08-23 11:50:48	GothAlice	The IT security is _real_ for EVE groups.
2017-08-23 11:51:18	GothAlice	(In my first week as head diplo I negotiated for control over a constellation of systems. ;)
2017-08-23 11:51:53	GothAlice	(Right on the edge connecting high-security space from low-security space; a major traffic lane.)
2017-08-23 11:51:59	keveloper	lol so are you gonna put that on your resume or :P
2017-08-23 11:52:05	GothAlice	Totally, yes.
2017-08-23 11:52:11	keveloper	XD
2017-08-23 11:52:28	GothAlice	keveloper: If you ever get into group mechanics in EVE, you'll understand.  ;)
2017-08-23 11:52:28	keveloper	maybe one day I'll be a pro rocket league player and put that on my resume lol
2017-08-23 11:53:56	GothAlice	Materials logistics, interpersonal conflict resolution, inter-organizational negotiation, navigation in stressful situations (active combat, but no need to write that specifically) managing hierarchical teams (wings w/ wing leaders w/ squads w/ squad leaders and line members) and team communication, operational security skills, …
2017-08-23 11:55:08	GothAlice	"Familiarity with zero-G six-degree manuvering."
2017-08-23 11:55:11	GothAlice	;^P
2017-08-24 10:02:23	GothAlice	https://clyp.it/x1e3dbvq — now we're getting somewhere!  (Additional four hours of work last night.)
2017-08-24 10:02:47	GothAlice	The last minute or so still needs some heavy arrangement work.  ^_^;
2017-08-24 10:04:11	GothAlice	I don't even know what genre this is any more.  XD
2017-08-24 10:09:54	keveloper	ayyy stutter snares nice
2017-08-24 10:10:02	keveloper	like the rhythmic variety in the perc
2017-08-24 10:10:08	GothAlice	^_____^ Spent _way_ too long on the drums.
2017-08-24 10:10:15	keveloper	it's so fun tho
2017-08-24 10:10:25	GothAlice	Also, trap favourite style.  <3
2017-08-24 10:10:49	keveloper	This is from Doom right?
2017-08-24 10:10:55	keveloper	You should try your hand at trap :D
2017-08-24 10:10:58	GothAlice	A replacement music mod.  :)
2017-08-24 10:11:06	GothAlice	Doom II Plutonia Project.
2017-08-24 10:11:11	keveloper	yeah i see that now
2017-08-24 10:11:15	 *	keveloper is blind
2017-08-24 10:11:48	GothAlice	I plan on adding some automation effects to propagate the snare stutter to some of the other instruments, too.
2017-08-24 10:12:11	GothAlice	(Only two tracks currently have automation; you can probably guess which ones when you get there. ;)
2017-08-24 10:12:35	keveloper	3:40 is sweet
2017-08-24 10:13:04	GothAlice	Tad cacophonous, and needs a good finisher.  :3
2017-08-24 10:13:12	keveloper	Yeah but the idea is cool :)
2017-08-24 10:13:42	GothAlice	Thanks!  ^_^  Straight porting the original is my first step; making it something new is step 2.  Step 2 is hard.  ;P
2017-08-24 10:14:45	GothAlice	(3:02+ — as the bass morphs, the drums get more bitcrushed. ;)
2017-08-24 10:19:41	GothAlice	That build is totally my favourite part.
2017-08-24 10:25:18	keveloper	write some original trap do it do it
2017-08-24 10:25:25	GothAlice	:P
2017-08-24 10:28:56	GothAlice	I'm, paradoxically, an improv reactionary-composer, e.g. I can add layers to almost anything I listen to just automatically; complicating music is what my brain does by itself.  On this one, the simple melody (pad / airy synth) was a torn apart and varied version of a simple chord progression from the original.
2017-08-24 10:29:14	GothAlice	Composing new?  Way harder for my brain, but what the heck, might give that a go.  XP
2017-08-24 10:30:38	GothAlice	(S'why I enjoy percussion so damn much; perfect for layering improv.)
2017-08-24 10:31:48	keveloper	Just gotta sit down and go with it :D
2017-08-24 10:32:05	keveloper	play some chords hum some stuff and boom youre there
2017-08-24 10:32:17	GothAlice	:P
2017-08-24 10:32:24	keveloper	obviously take inspiration from other song you currently are listening to
2017-08-24 10:32:38	keveloper	idk im lucky though, writing comes semi naturally to me :)
2017-08-24 10:32:51	keveloper	if only i had more time :'(
2017-08-24 10:33:06	GothAlice	Yeah, I have to say, you're stupidly good.  (Which is a good thing.)  ^_^
2017-08-24 10:33:13	keveloper	thank you very much :D lol
2017-08-24 10:33:17	keveloper	i wish i didn't stop for 3 years
2017-08-24 10:33:29	keveloper	i need to get on writing originals
2017-08-24 10:33:33	GothAlice	Sharing what I produce with you feels like, "Notice me sempai!"
2017-08-24 10:33:34	keveloper	(again)
2017-08-24 10:34:00	keveloper	ha :P youre also very talented dont down play yourself
2017-08-24 10:34:23	keveloper	If you like trap/electronic you sohuld listen to DROELOE's new EP "A moment in time"
2017-08-24 10:34:24	keveloper	It's awesome
2017-08-24 10:34:29	keveloper	I've listened through 5 times in the last day
2017-08-24 10:34:31	GothAlice	OoooOooh.
2017-08-24 10:34:32	keveloper	Awesome unique sound
2017-08-24 10:34:43	keveloper	can't stop listening
2017-08-24 10:35:06	keveloper	oops it's Droloe not DROLOE
2017-08-24 10:35:10	GothAlice	I've got a few of your tracks in my short-repeat-all playlist.  ^_^  "Soundtrack 1" has several hundred plays so far…
2017-08-24 10:35:22	keveloper	can't keep track of who all caps their names these days
2017-08-24 10:35:28	keveloper	oh wow thanks :D
2017-08-24 10:35:46	keveloper	wrote that one for school after watching the social network lol
2017-08-24 10:36:12	keveloper	and its 'sndtrk 1' :P
2017-08-24 10:36:29	GothAlice	I metadata'd it as "Soundtrack One", like Rogue One.  ;P
2017-08-24 10:36:38	keveloper	hahaha :P
2017-08-24 10:37:13	GothAlice	"One" has more gravitas than "1", eh?
2017-08-24 10:37:22	keveloper	Yes for sure 
2017-08-24 10:37:35	keveloper	I was a 19 year old 'sndtrk 1' was sweet back then
2017-08-24 10:39:14	keveloper	I still have the PC with a TON of old music on it, might start it up and fish some stuff out for you to listen to :D
2017-08-24 10:39:20	keveloper	most of it is unfinished but there's some cool things on there
2017-08-24 10:39:23	GothAlice	I would love you forever.
2017-08-24 10:39:29	keveloper	:)
2017-08-24 10:39:36	GothAlice	Hell, I already do, no need to ransom my love.  ;P
2017-08-24 10:39:43	keveloper	lol :P <3
2017-08-24 10:40:04	keveloper	I like reminiscing through old music anyway :D
2017-08-24 10:40:10	keveloper	for both the good and the awful lol
2017-08-24 10:40:45	keveloper	don't forget to listen to that droeloe ep (now playing over here :D )
2017-08-24 10:42:07	GothAlice	I'll queue it up for lunch.  ^_^  https://clyp.it/suf5wz44 — one of my first tracker things, built using only sounds from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogo:_Mobile_Armor_Division (also from that time trackin', a cover of Popcorn, and Burn!)
2017-08-24 10:43:12	keveloper	ahh gtg i'll check it out in a bit
2017-08-24 10:43:18	GothAlice	Yeah, no worries!
2017-08-24 11:10:44	keveloper	k now listening
2017-08-24 11:11:32	keveloper	lol this is neat
2017-08-24 11:12:24	GothAlice	The game was hilarious; anime-basic with mecha, you're a pilot, missions go between on-foot and in-mech.  On-foot you get to hear news reports… about you.  They're not positive.  ;)
2017-08-24 11:12:42	keveloper	"sir shut the hell up sir" lol
2017-08-24 11:12:59	GothAlice	Yeah, you can choose to obey your commander (who is going progressively more insane and twisted… for reasons) or disobey.  XD
2017-08-24 11:13:33	GothAlice	Er, Admiral, rather.
2017-08-24 11:13:59	keveloper	ah it looks like i deleted but i made a song out of 4 saxophone samples of my friend that got pretty crazy lol
2017-08-24 11:14:09	GothAlice	^____^ Restrictions breed creativity!
2017-08-24 11:14:10	keveloper	ya its not on my soundcloud
2017-08-24 11:14:31	keveloper	i have it somewhere, i'll upload that with the batch of old stuf flol
2017-08-24 11:14:42	GothAlice	"I got me some anger!"
2017-08-24 11:15:22	keveloper	have you heard this one: https://soundcloud.com/kevinhollandmusic/just-a-little
2017-08-24 11:15:27	keveloper	one of favs of my older stuff
2017-08-24 11:15:28	GothAlice	*clicks*
2017-08-24 11:15:57	GothAlice	Love the arhythm of the EP.
2017-08-24 11:16:25	keveloper	this was back when i was fan of random percussion shit happening
2017-08-24 11:16:33	GothAlice	It totally works.
2017-08-24 11:16:33	keveloper	well i still am but this was when i first started using it lol
2017-08-24 11:16:47	keveloper	there's a random bongo sometimes if you pay attention lol
2017-08-24 11:16:59	GothAlice	I really need to start using more vocal clips; I'm way too instrumental.  XP
2017-08-24 11:17:19	keveloper	setting up samples and fucking around on this for a while: https://dt7v1i9vyp3mf.cloudfront.net/styles/news_large/s3/imagelibrary/m/maudiotriggerfingerfront.jpg?261EEI4EzK9UKwKVw4kWqnmA9sgUf89p=&itok=w-G8hR9v
2017-08-24 11:17:20	keveloper	so fun
2017-08-24 11:17:44	keveloper	old trigger fingers are so hard to find :'(
2017-08-24 11:17:55	GothAlice	^_^ Have a similar layout on my iPad; despite being a touch screen, it's impressively sensitive to initial tap pressure.
2017-08-24 11:18:06	keveloper	ooh nice
2017-08-24 11:18:09	keveloper	that's surprising
2017-08-24 11:18:11	GothAlice	(And no button depth = instant triggers.  Sometimes too fast.)
2017-08-24 11:19:12	keveloper	another one of my favs: https://soundcloud.com/kevinhollandmusic/try
2017-08-24 11:19:16	keveloper	(thats me singing lol)
2017-08-24 11:19:21	GothAlice	Yeah, blew me away that it was able to get 64 divisions of tap strength.  Just sat there tapping one trigger repeatedly going "what in the actual…" ;P
2017-08-24 11:19:36	keveloper	ipads have that fancy pressure thing right tho
2017-08-24 11:19:43	GothAlice	Nooooope.
2017-08-24 11:19:45	keveloper	oh
2017-08-24 11:19:46	keveloper	wait wa
2017-08-24 11:19:50	GothAlice	Yeeeeeah.
2017-08-24 11:19:52	keveloper	hm
2017-08-24 11:20:08	keveloper	does it have to do with like surface area of your finger
2017-08-24 11:20:11	GothAlice	(It uses the built-in accelerometer to detect the impulse force. ;)
2017-08-24 11:20:15	keveloper	ahhhh
2017-08-24 11:20:16	keveloper	ok cool
2017-08-24 11:20:49	GothAlice	This has side-effects.  For example, walking on a treadmill with it in one arm, tapping with the other, leads to interesting effects.  >:D
2017-08-24 11:20:57	keveloper	lolol
2017-08-24 11:22:27	keveloper	haaa i've stumbled back into my high school music now ooh boy
2017-08-24 11:23:01	GothAlice	Yeah… needs more download button.  :3
2017-08-24 11:23:21	keveloper	junior year of highschool: https://soundcloud.com/kevinhollandmusic/i-know-you-feel-it-ft-chris-harris/s-Mob10
2017-08-24 11:23:52	keveloper	(it was in style back then lol)
2017-08-24 11:24:04	GothAlice	keveloper: Okay, the pad in that one.
2017-08-24 11:24:09	keveloper	(when my stage name was K-Holl) lolol
2017-08-24 11:24:10	keveloper	pad in which one
2017-08-24 11:24:11	GothAlice	That gives me 90's flashbacks!
2017-08-24 11:24:16	GothAlice	https://soundcloud.com/kevinhollandmusic/i-know-you-feel-it-ft-chris-harris/s-Mob10
2017-08-24 11:24:19	keveloper	yeah lol
2017-08-24 11:24:32	keveloper	i forgot I rap in this one XD lolol
2017-08-24 11:24:36	GothAlice	Nice stutter ~0:40…
2017-08-24 11:24:54	keveloper	:D
2017-08-24 11:24:57	GothAlice	Not bad at all.
2017-08-24 11:25:01	keveloper	thanks lol :D
2017-08-24 11:25:10	keveloper	used to perform at high school dances with Chris lol
2017-08-24 11:25:12	GothAlice	Dat hard-wall compressor, doe.
2017-08-24 11:25:34	keveloper	also that stutter is the same plugin as electric touch (7 years later)
2017-08-24 11:25:40	GothAlice	:D
2017-08-24 11:25:46	keveloper	dblue glitch
2017-08-24 11:25:47	keveloper	v1
2017-08-24 11:25:50	keveloper	(free vst)
2017-08-24 11:25:53	keveloper	v2 is not free
2017-08-24 11:26:02	keveloper	My rapping (lol) is at 2:36
2017-08-24 11:26:18	GothAlice	Yeah, the only negative my ears are experiencing is the compression with hardwall limiter.  The clipping is real.  XP
2017-08-24 11:26:22	keveloper	LOL
2017-08-24 11:26:32	keveloper	it was too loud for my mastering skills lol
2017-08-24 11:26:33	GothAlice	Great vocals.
2017-08-24 11:26:44	GothAlice	(Heh, my Firewall track has _no_ global mastering yet.)
2017-08-24 11:27:05	keveloper	this was before i went to school for music production now im better at mixing/mastering :)
2017-08-24 11:27:12	keveloper	although i didnt finish the degree lol
2017-08-24 11:27:15	keveloper	switched to CS/math
2017-08-24 11:27:49	GothAlice	Programming, photography, music?  It's all just math in the end.  ;P
2017-08-24 11:28:23	keveloper	except one of three makes you a lot of money lol
2017-08-24 11:28:25	keveloper	:P
2017-08-24 11:28:30	GothAlice	XP
2017-08-24 11:28:36	keveloper	(not why I went into CS tho dont worry)
2017-08-24 11:30:04	GothAlice	The cross-over is impressive, though.  A curves filter in photography… is a static compressor filter in audio.  Levels in photography is a bandpass filter in audio.  Etc.
2017-08-24 11:30:22	GothAlice	Hell, my music is ~1/3rd JavaScript.  :P
2017-08-25 14:03:52	GothAlice	https://clyp.it/enmcktnx — in case it got lost in backlog yesterday; b2 with more badass ^_^
2017-08-28 17:10:41	keveloper	im in vegas ill listen tomorrow
2017-09-01 14:33:33	keveloper	bout to give in and buy FL Studio
2017-09-01 14:33:33	--	[GothAlice] is away: Be back later
2017-09-01 14:40:43	GothAlice	o^_______________________^o
2017-09-01 23:05:27	keveloper	so I bought new monitors and a scarlet 2i2 or whatever its called
2017-09-01 23:06:20	keveloper	FL studio will be soon tho
2017-09-01 23:06:23	keveloper	and komplete
2017-09-03 12:08:59	keveloper	playing with some standard stuff that comes with FL studio for 30 mintues and having a blast lol
2017-09-03 12:09:10	keveloper	a little weirded out by FL's arrange window and mixer and how this all work sbut
2017-09-03 12:11:24	keveloper	OH I FIGURED IT OUT okay i get how the mixer works now
2017-09-03 12:11:27	keveloper	jeez fl studio is bizarre tho
2017-09-03 13:04:28	GothAlice	^_^ FL Studio is a bit weird.  But no weirder than, say, going from an advanced tracker to Logic, I'd think.
2017-09-03 13:34:49	keveloper	 have you ever used it
2017-09-05 10:06:50	keveloper	 still so weirded out by FL studio
2017-09-05 10:07:00	keveloper	I think it'll take a long time to best fast in it lol
2017-09-05 10:25:41	GothAlice	I poked around in FL when a buddy got it a few years back; wasn't a fan, it was too weird for me.  ^_^
2017-09-05 10:26:23	keveloper	Yeah you have to make like patterns before you actually put anything in the arrange window
2017-09-05 10:26:24	keveloper	very odd
2017-09-05 10:26:36	keveloper	and then you like route stuff in your synth rack to the mixewr
2017-09-05 10:26:41	keveloper	and you can put multiple things on one mixer track
2017-09-05 10:26:42	GothAlice	It's more like a tracker than a non-linear editor.
2017-09-05 10:26:43	keveloper	idk its weird
2017-09-05 10:26:46	keveloper	yeah
2017-09-05 10:26:57	keveloper	but so many people use it and make awesome music with it so
2017-09-05 10:27:01	keveloper	there has to be something to is
2017-09-05 10:27:02	keveloper	it*
2017-09-05 10:27:11	GothAlice	(MPT has a similar "yo, dawg, you need to define a pattern before you place a pattern in the timeline, 'cause patterns, bro".)
2017-09-05 10:27:19	keveloper	MPT?
2017-09-05 10:27:23	GothAlice	ModPlug Tracker
2017-09-05 10:27:42	keveloper	i really like FL's UI tho
2017-09-05 10:27:52	GothAlice	What I made Burn!, my Shogo! MAD track, and my cover of Popcorn in.  ;P
2017-09-05 10:28:01	keveloper	Adding FX to tracks in the mixer is a little difficult
2017-09-05 10:28:23	keveloper	I've yet to figure out how to make the grid smaller than 1/8th notes
2017-09-05 10:28:40	GothAlice	Ye gods, and the keyboard shortcuts to muscle-memorize.
2017-09-05 10:28:57	keveloper	was trying to do 1/16th note sanre for a build and had to just eye it because i gave up on snapping it
2017-09-05 10:29:20	 *	GothAlice often drops into the MIDI event editor for fine positioning in Logic…
2017-09-05 10:29:47	GothAlice	And the event editor side-bar thing for marking articulations.  Still haven't found a good way to do that in the sequence editor itself.
2017-09-05 10:30:26	 *	GothAlice just wishes humanization didn't alter the source notes.  That causes a lot of issues.
2017-09-05 10:34:47	keveloper	I've yet to record midi in FL studio it's a little confusing
2017-09-05 10:34:54	keveloper	idk how to arm tracks yet
2017-09-05 10:35:12	keveloper	Everytime I thought I armed something and record the midi went somehwere else and im like "WHAT?"
2017-09-05 10:35:16	keveloper	so yeah im a little confused lol
2017-09-05 10:35:26	GothAlice	XD
2017-09-05 10:35:30	keveloper	i've only used standard DAWs for the last 10 years lol
2017-09-05 10:35:33	GothAlice	The blinking red R in Logic is nicely obvious.  XP
2017-09-05 10:35:41	keveloper	logic/pro tools/sonar/reason
2017-09-05 10:35:42	keveloper	yeah
2017-09-05 10:35:50	keveloper	every other daw its very obvious how to record
2017-09-05 10:36:08	keveloper	if only logic was on windows
2017-09-05 10:36:14	keveloper	im def not doing protools
2017-09-05 10:36:21	keveloper	sonar crashes to much and is annoying
2017-09-05 10:36:27	keveloper	reason is rip
2017-09-05 10:36:29	keveloper	maybe cubase
2017-09-05 10:36:36	keveloper	some decently big artists use cubase
2017-09-05 10:36:38	keveloper	namely zedd
2017-09-05 10:36:49	GothAlice	After getting a Mac with a free copy of Garage Band (which uses the same internal sequencer as Logic), I never went back to trackers.  ^_^
2017-09-05 10:38:42	keveloper	Yeah I like sonar for the most part but the synths that come with it aren't very good and it crashes sometimes so...
2017-09-05 10:38:53	keveloper	And there are a few annoying bugs/features i cant deal with
2017-09-05 10:39:02	keveloper	but its my fav daw (because I know it so well)
2017-09-05 10:39:30	keveloper	also some of the synths I've been playing with in FL studio are in the $900 version lol
2017-09-05 10:39:37	keveloper	I guess I still have all the synths from sonar though
2017-09-05 10:39:39	keveloper	then komplete
2017-09-05 10:39:41	keveloper	i'll be fine
2017-09-05 10:40:00	keveloper	maybe i'll get komplete first and see what I can do in sonar
2017-09-05 10:40:17	keveloper	I see the potential of FL studio's synth rack sequencer thing so i dunno
2017-09-05 10:40:20	GothAlice	If you really dive into it, Komplete will consume the next year of your life.  ;P
2017-09-05 10:40:39	keveloper	i might really try to make something with fl studio tonight
2017-09-05 10:40:45	keveloper	(i havent bought it yet so im on the demo)
2017-09-05 10:40:57	keveloper	but the demo is basically the full thign you just cant bounce anything
2017-09-05 10:41:38	GothAlice	Always a good idea to try before you buy.  The #1 reason I occasionally support piracy as an option, if trying isn't.  (With the understanding that if useful and used for real things, it'll be purchased.)
2017-09-05 10:42:13	keveloper	I got rocket league off of g2a then felt bad after playing it for like 150 hours so I bought the actual game
2017-09-05 10:53:26	GothAlice	Games are an odd case, for me.  I purchase some games I have no intention of personally playing, just to support the developer.  E.g. Whispered World and a bunch of others.
2017-09-05 10:54:21	GothAlice	(I don't have the patience for point-and-click adventure, but did watch others' playthroughs. I got a lot of entertainment from the game indirectly, and wanted to home-share with my sister, who does have the patience, so snagged a copy I've never run.)
2017-09-05 10:55:52	keveloper	Never heard of it
2017-09-05 10:55:56	keveloper	I haven't bought a game in a whiiile
2017-09-05 10:56:05	keveloper	rocket league, ori, and planet coaster for like the last year
2017-09-05 10:56:28	keveloper	it's hard to get into games when theres like 300 things i wanna do
2017-09-05 10:56:45	keveloper	music/freelance/side dev stuff/gaming/outside stuff
2017-09-05 10:56:57	keveloper	not enough time :(((
2017-09-05 11:50:27	GothAlice	Speaking of too much work… https://github.com/marrow/mongo/issues/50
2017-09-05 11:50:28	GothAlice	XP
2017-09-06 10:27:02	keveloper	I just don't know if I can do it
2017-09-06 10:27:13	keveloper	I actually started making something in FL last night
2017-09-06 10:27:15	keveloper	its so weird
2017-09-06 10:27:20	GothAlice	^____^
2017-09-06 10:27:22	keveloper	I might be back to sonar
2017-09-06 10:27:36	keveloper	At least I'll get complete tho
2017-09-06 10:27:42	GothAlice	Dug through any introductory tutorials on YouTube for it?
2017-09-06 10:27:48	keveloper	Yeah a little bit\
2017-09-06 10:27:56	keveloper	I'm understanding most of it now
2017-09-06 10:28:01	keveloper	It's just so bizarre
2017-09-06 10:28:32	keveloper	Like okay I made this perc pattern now I have to make a new pattern for the synth I guess oh and then drag this over here idk its so awkwar
2017-09-06 10:28:46	keveloper	I really like how the automation works though
2017-09-06 10:29:28	keveloper	But the typical workflow of recording and building tracks is just so wonky and slow
2017-09-06 10:30:42	keveloper	I'll keep at it for a few days though to see if I get used to it
2017-09-06 10:30:55	keveloper	Do you know of any other good windows daws
2017-09-06 10:32:21	keveloper	i wonder how reason is doing
2017-09-06 10:33:43	GothAlice	Reason is the big one I remember from my Windows days.
2017-09-06 10:33:54	GothAlice	There was another tracker one, like MPT, but way, way more pro, commercial, and awesome.
2017-09-06 10:34:25	keveloper	i remember reason being hard to use and the arrange window was tiny af
2017-09-06 10:34:30	GothAlice	ChibiTracker (not the one I'm thinking of), Renoise, that's the one.
2017-09-06 10:34:39	GothAlice	Renoise = fscking epic tracker.
2017-09-06 10:35:08	keveloper	cubase is $580 :o
2017-09-06 10:35:52	GothAlice	Then there's also Studio One, Radium, …
2017-09-06 10:36:09	keveloper	tf is radium
2017-09-06 10:36:28	GothAlice	http://users.notam02.no/~kjetism/radium/
2017-09-06 10:36:31	GothAlice	Remembering that I do tend towards the open source / free.  ;P
2017-09-06 10:37:10	keveloper	wwaat is that
2017-09-06 10:37:18	GothAlice	>:D
2017-09-06 10:37:22	GothAlice	If you think FL is confusing…
2017-09-06 10:37:25	keveloper	lolol
2017-09-06 10:37:33	keveloper	i dont think FL is confusing I think it's stupid :P
2017-09-06 10:37:46	keveloper	I was excited about it too :'''(
2017-09-06 10:38:59	keveloper	i would do logic but rip windows
2017-09-06 10:40:51	keveloper	there's a new sonar out though hmmmm
2017-09-06 10:41:02	keveloper	$500 for platinum

2017-09-06 10:42:19	keveloper	my dad used to use a cli one

2017-09-06 10:42:42	GothAlice	Trackers are pretty recognizable on sight.  ;P
2017-09-06 10:42:53	GothAlice	Vs. NLEs.
2017-09-06 10:44:27	 *	GothAlice appreciates MPT not going batsh*t with the themeing and using standard OS widgets instead.  Much clean, super usable, less eyestrain.
2017-09-06 10:46:32	keveloper	stuck between planet coaster and music right now
2017-09-06 10:46:37	keveloper	my dilemmas are real
2017-09-06 10:58:58	GothAlice	My soul-sucking game of choice is Rimworld.  My word I can just go forever doing unspeakably evil things to the simulated people.
2017-09-06 10:59:55	GothAlice	My main save at this point has… 23 mass graves each filled with 50 corpses.  Raiding parties, captured people, organ harvesting, or, my most diabolical yet, implantation of an AI core in their brain and release back to their (hostile to me) faction.  They're OK for a few weeks.  Then they're not.  ;)
2017-09-06 11:01:13	keveloper	You're actually a mad scientist
2017-09-06 11:01:51	GothAlice	The game doesn't have a difficulty setting that poses a challenge any more, which sucks.  So now I'm writing my own difficulty levels.  XD
2017-09-06 11:11:30	keveloper	I have an idea for an original tonight :D
2017-09-06 11:11:35	keveloper	lyricless, just vocal chops
2017-09-06 11:11:49	keveloper	By tonight I mean start tonight finish in a month lol
2017-09-06 11:17:11	GothAlice	XD
2017-09-06 11:17:13	GothAlice	Always.
2017-09-06 11:17:34	keveloper	Might buy komplete tonight...
2017-09-06 11:17:50	keveloper	I don't _need_ a new DAW right now
2017-09-06 11:18:08	GothAlice	The joy of external synth plugins; they work with almost any DAW.  ;P
2017-09-06 11:18:14	keveloper	:D:D
2017-09-06 11:18:24	keveloper	I might even just get the next iteration of sonar
2017-09-06 11:18:27	keveloper	it looks way better
2017-09-06 11:18:31	keveloper	the one i have is from like 2013
2017-09-06 11:19:23	keveloper	err 2014 I think
2017-09-06 11:19:25	keveloper	still though
2017-09-06 11:19:49	keveloper	Just gotta figure out if I wanna pay $500 for the platinum edition
2017-09-06 12:04:52	GothAlice	These tools are always so ‘spensive. :/
2017-09-06 12:30:36	keveloper	the $500 thing has one tool i really want called v-vocal... it was in X1 and X2, they  took it out of X3
2017-09-06 12:30:40	keveloper	put it back in I guess
2017-09-06 12:42:22	GothAlice	Oooooh... do you have any tools already that feature Direct Note Access?
2017-09-06 12:42:54	GothAlice	Melodyne is insane.
2017-09-06 12:44:59	keveloper	direct note access?
2017-09-06 12:45:02	GothAlice	“Burn them, clearly they’re witches.” levels of Science!
2017-09-06 12:45:02	keveloper	i've used melodyne
2017-09-06 12:45:12	keveloper	i've used autotune melodyne and v-vocal
2017-09-06 12:45:17	GothAlice	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFCjv4_jqAY
2017-09-06 12:45:52	keveloper	yeah v-vocal has that
2017-09-06 12:46:02	keveloper	i like v-vocal way better also
2017-09-06 12:46:30	keveloper	autotune is fun because midi for pitch lol
2017-09-06 12:46:41	keveloper	you can sing and play midi and it will correct to the pitch in real time
2017-09-06 12:47:09	GothAlice	Re-chording is what really blew my mind. Polyphonic _note_ isolation.
2017-09-06 12:47:56	GothAlice	“Let me just tweak that one string on that guitar strum...”
2017-09-06 12:48:05	GothAlice	just wat
2017-09-06 12:48:11	keveloper	that's cool
2017-09-06 12:48:55	GothAlice	Witchcraft. XP
2017-09-06 14:05:08	GothAlice	https://clyp.it/ssljrjhl?token=888b37f296a4584db1b755a3caaa938a ← this I just mentioned in #webdev was made entirely using Audacity to blend mixes.  #DirtCheapMixing
2017-09-06 14:05:26	GothAlice	Free is good.  ;^P
2017-09-06 14:46:23	keveloper	Ooh I think I've got something going here
2017-09-06 14:46:26	keveloper	(left work early sick)
2017-09-07 10:09:36	keveloper	thing i made last night, i dunno where its going... https://soundcloud.com/kevinhollandmusic/ok-1/s-oBphl
2017-09-07 10:10:04	keveloper	also the chorus is meh rn cause I just started on it so :P
2017-09-07 10:18:28	GothAlice	Soundcloud, why u so bad?
2017-09-07 10:18:34	keveloper	waat
2017-09-07 10:18:42	keveloper	did the link not work
2017-09-07 10:18:45	GothAlice	First attempt, hit play, started playing not your track.  Second attempt: http://s.webcore.io/2X0f0v080J3N/Screen%20Shot%202017-09-07%20at%2010.18.32.png
2017-09-07 10:18:49	GothAlice	It's playing, but WTF.
2017-09-07 10:18:50	GothAlice	XD
2017-09-07 10:19:19	keveloper	the last half of it is silence because automation shit i need to clean up lol
2017-09-07 10:20:34	keveloper	but yeah the chorus is pretty meh but i like the melodies
2017-09-07 10:20:42	keveloper	(did this in sonar btw lo)
2017-09-07 10:20:44	keveloper	lol**
2017-09-07 10:20:59	GothAlice	XD
2017-09-07 10:21:51	GothAlice	I like it; mellow, pleasing progressive build, good instrument differentiation, "my brand" levels of drum.  :D
2017-09-07 10:21:57	GothAlice	<3 claps and glitchy snares.
2017-09-07 10:22:09	keveloper	:D
2017-09-07 10:22:37	keveloper	just gotta make it a bit more interesting
2017-09-07 10:22:43	GothAlice	Yeah, needs a topper.
2017-09-07 10:22:55	keveloper	and redo the chorus because i was just throwing crap in there as the gf was trying to make me go to bed lolol
2017-09-07 10:22:56	GothAlice	And a denouement.
2017-09-07 16:05:19	GothAlice	Oh my.  I now have an idea for a Weird Al-esque replacement lyric cover of Prozzäk / Pretty Girls.  Humans.  "Humans make me nervous when they're as human as you…"  XD
2017-09-07 16:05:53	GothAlice	It's be way less self-deprecating and more, eew, humans.  ;P
2017-09-07 16:37:47	keveloper	lol interesting idea
2017-09-09 10:36:44	keveloper	Ayyy yt
2017-09-11 11:23:43	<--	GothAlice (~amcgregor@unaffiliated/gothalice) has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
2017-09-11 15:01:25	-->	GothAlice (~amcgregor@unaffiliated/gothalice) is back on server
2017-09-15 09:55:30	GothAlice	Baws.  Like the super clarity on the finger snaps.
2017-09-15 09:55:34	keveloper	:)
2017-09-15 09:55:38	keveloper	it was a free sample library
2017-09-15 09:55:39	keveloper	:o
2017-09-15 09:55:51	keveloper	also I changed my name :P
2017-09-15 10:07:28	GothAlice	I noticed!
2017-09-15 11:10:06	keveloper	What do you think of the new remix? :D
2017-09-15 11:11:16	GothAlice	Hehe, been too busy to listen to it more than twice.  And goddamn, my monitor has only three volume levels: mute, low (1/12 dots), ROCK THE HOUSE (anything higher).
2017-09-15 11:11:17	GothAlice	XD
2017-09-15 11:11:33	keveloper	lol :D it sounds sooo good on my new monitors
2017-09-15 11:11:35	keveloper	love them :D
2017-09-15 11:11:55	 *	GothAlice may have forgotten an amp around here somewhere turned to 11…
2017-09-15 11:12:10	keveloper	lol :P
2017-09-15 11:13:14	GothAlice	So yeah, overall, love the arrangement.  The "oh!" pitch shifted sting is a bit _too_ loopy when it's taking the lead, if you understand.  Needs some variation, maybe?
2017-09-15 11:13:35	keveloper	in the drop?
2017-09-15 11:14:26	GothAlice	0:52 → 1:42
2017-09-15 11:14:37	keveloper	Yeah the melody?
2017-09-15 11:14:42	 *	GothAlice nods.
2017-09-15 11:14:51	keveloper	The first for 2 bars of every iteration of it is different, then the last 2 are the same
2017-09-15 11:15:05	GothAlice	The vocals take over after that and it's _frickin awesome_, and the sting turns into an accent, which is great.
2017-09-15 11:15:35	keveloper	One of fav things is the hats at 1:42
2017-09-15 11:15:40	GothAlice	The second bout ~2:35 in is shorter and denser, making it feel less loopy.
2017-09-15 11:16:28	keveloper	if you listen to the lyrics this song is ridiculous by the way lol, just randomy stumbled across it and was like "huh i'll use this i guess" lol
2017-09-15 11:16:41	keveloper	"took you off of my instagram and told my mom its official" uhhh ok
2017-09-15 11:16:47	GothAlice	^_^ Yeah, each time I listen through a track I focus on a different instrument.  My brain can't help but focus like that.  The drum arrangement is pleasingly matched.
2017-09-15 11:16:51	GothAlice	It's a breakup song.  XP
2017-09-15 11:17:05	keveloper	wooo
2017-09-15 11:17:09	keveloper	ye i spent a long time on the perc
2017-09-15 11:17:22	keveloper	Esp. the drop hats which are prettty burried anyway
2017-09-15 11:18:04	GothAlice	During the intro build, the gritty fatness of combined kick and snare is nice.
2017-09-15 11:18:06	keveloper	i added a sitar to the back the horns on the last drop that sounded pretty cool but i turned it down to low loool
2017-09-15 11:18:07	keveloper	oops
2017-09-15 11:18:14	keveloper	thanks :D
2017-09-15 11:18:16	keveloper	inspired by flume
2017-09-15 11:27:38	GothAlice	For once Soundcloud had a good segue.  Your Electric Touch → https://soundcloud.com/uprizevictoria/like-animals-1
2017-09-15 11:28:05	keveloper	hey i was wondering what this song was called omg lol
2017-09-15 11:28:09	keveloper	hear it on bpm a lot
2017-09-15 11:28:15	GothAlice	XD

2017-09-21 14:03:28	keveloper	:)
2017-09-21 14:03:45	keveloper	I was waiting for him to be like "but MY ico will..." and he was just like "interested?"
2017-09-21 14:03:48	keveloper	im like "WHAT"
