2017-04-06 10:44:23	keveloper	I figured it's easier to talk here
2017-04-06 10:44:27	keveloper	Rather than clutter up css
2017-04-06 10:44:44	keveloper	So this selector: .g-main-nav a { .g-menu-item.active { background: #123456; } }
2017-04-06 10:45:32	keveloper	CSS inteprets that as this: Find an element with the class g-main-nav, from there find an <a> tag, from the find an element with the classes g-menu-item and active
2017-04-06 10:45:35	keveloper	Style that element
2017-04-06 10:45:52	keveloper	The last part is where that selector breaks for you
2017-04-06 10:46:15	tpanarch1st	hey, firstly, thanks ever so much for your time
2017-04-06 10:46:27	keveloper	Youre welcome :)
2017-04-06 10:46:35	keveloper	Always willing to help people learn
2017-04-06 10:46:51	keveloper	So your markup is something like
2017-04-06 10:46:53	tpanarch1st	thank you - I do warn you, my dyslexia really plays up with coding!
2017-04-06 10:47:14	tpanarch1st	so I read everything people say to the letter when it comes to this and sometimes it creates conflict :)
2017-04-06 10:47:31	tpanarch1st	so re, the above
2017-04-06 10:47:33	keveloper	<div class"g-main-nav">...<li class="g-menu-item active"><a></a></li>...</div>
2017-04-06 10:47:45	tpanarch1st	ok, i shall follow you :)
2017-04-06 10:47:59	keveloper	You want to style that a tag in there
2017-04-06 10:48:08	keveloper	But only if it's the active nav item
2017-04-06 10:48:20	keveloper	So your selector should start with .g-main-nav
2017-04-06 10:48:30	keveloper	because you only want to style active items under the main nav
2017-04-06 10:48:47	tpanarch1st	with you so far :)
2017-04-06 10:49:13	keveloper	Then under that nav you want any g-menu-items that are also active
2017-04-06 10:49:22	keveloper	.g-menu-item.active is that
2017-04-06 10:49:28	tpanarch1st	what is a g-menu-item?
2017-04-06 10:49:34	keveloper	A class in your markup
2017-04-06 10:49:37	tpanarch1st	is that just like any menu item in gantry?
2017-04-06 10:49:42	tpanarch1st	in laymens terms?
2017-04-06 10:49:44	keveloper	maybe im not sure
2017-04-06 10:49:49	tpanarch1st	ahhh ok :)
2017-04-06 10:49:53	keveloper	it is a menu-item in gantry i'd imagine :P
2017-04-06 10:50:08	tpanarch1st	sure, i get why we are being specific about what we are picking though!
2017-04-06 10:50:15	tpanarch1st	otherwise it affects too much
2017-04-06 10:50:28	keveloper	so since that li is descendant of the div (not the same as a child) you'd put them together like such
2017-04-06 10:50:42	keveloper	.g-main-nav .g-menu-item.active
2017-04-06 10:50:50	keveloper	So that means any active menu item under a main nav
2017-04-06 10:50:59	keveloper	But that selects the li, not the a tag
2017-04-06 10:51:09	keveloper	So you'd add an a to the end of that
2017-04-06 10:51:16	tpanarch1st	so "take .g-main-nav and look for .g-menu-item.active under it"?
2017-04-06 10:51:16	keveloper	Since that one IS a child, you can use the > selector
2017-04-06 10:51:20	keveloper	Yes
2017-04-06 10:51:27	keveloper	So you'd end up with
2017-04-06 10:51:30	tpanarch1st	this is how I tend to try and translate things!
2017-04-06 10:51:40	keveloper	.g-main-nav .g-menu-item.active > a
2017-04-06 10:51:51	tpanarch1st	got you, you know this "child" stuff
2017-04-06 10:52:05	tpanarch1st	is that pretty much meaning "under it"
2017-04-06 10:52:12	keveloper	Find a g-main-nav, find a g-menu-item and active under that, find an <a> that is a CHILD
2017-04-06 10:52:16	keveloper	yes
2017-04-06 10:52:18	keveloper	under it anywhere
2017-04-06 10:52:27	keveloper	it's called a descendant
2017-04-06 10:52:31	keveloper	vs a child
2017-04-06 10:52:34	keveloper	which is DIRECTLY udner it
2017-04-06 10:52:36	keveloper	that is >
2017-04-06 10:52:38	tpanarch1st	ahhh :) - someone loved family trees!
2017-04-06 10:52:42	keveloper	lol
2017-04-06 10:52:43	keveloper	yep
2017-04-06 10:52:46	tpanarch1st	so just being a geek does < do anything?
2017-04-06 10:52:52	keveloper	and anything above an element is an ancestor
2017-04-06 10:52:55	keveloper	no
2017-04-06 10:53:05	keveloper	css selector only go deeper into the DOM, not back up it
2017-04-06 10:53:06	tpanarch1st	ah cool so it's like shorthand
2017-04-06 10:53:28	tpanarch1st	I do that to depict menus Mother ->Child ->Child's Toy
2017-04-06 10:53:33	tpanarch1st	similar idea?
2017-04-06 10:53:39	keveloper	Yeah
2017-04-06 10:53:43	tpanarch1st	right ok :)
2017-04-06 10:53:54	keveloper	.grandmother > .grandchild
2017-04-06 10:53:55	keveloper	Does not work
2017-04-06 10:54:03	tpanarch1st	ooooh how come?
2017-04-06 10:54:15	tpanarch1st	because mother needs to be in between?
2017-04-06 10:54:18	tpanarch1st	or father indeed
2017-04-06 10:54:18	keveloper	because .grandchild is not the child of .grandmother
2017-04-06 10:54:19	keveloper	yes
2017-04-06 10:54:21	keveloper	yeah
2017-04-06 10:54:22	tpanarch1st	yeah right!
2017-04-06 10:54:52	keveloper	.grandmother .grandchild works because a space is essentially a descendant selector
2017-04-06 10:54:55	tpanarch1st	ok, can you not be lazy and say target grandchild under grandmother (and everything else (I presume that would be the tradeoff)
2017-04-06 10:55:16	keveloper	I'm not sure what you mean by and everything else
2017-04-06 10:55:20	tpanarch1st	ahhh 
2017-04-06 10:55:32	tpanarch1st	ok, actually i think i know the answer to my own question
2017-04-06 10:55:35	keveloper	target grandchild under grandmother would ".grandmother .grandchild"
2017-04-06 10:56:02	tpanarch1st	so basically if you want to target everything you'd simply use .grandmother as the selector and mother and grandchild would inherit?
2017-04-06 10:56:16	tpanarch1st	oh right, maybe i'm wrong
2017-04-06 10:56:26	keveloper	Depends on the attribute :P
2017-04-06 10:56:30	tpanarch1st	ahhhh meh :-p
2017-04-06 10:56:32	keveloper	But if you did like
2017-04-06 10:56:46	keveloper	.grandmother { color: grey; } 
2017-04-06 10:56:54	keveloper	All descendant text would be grey
2017-04-06 10:57:06	keveloper	UNLESS there is a more specific selector overriding the text color
2017-04-06 10:57:35	tpanarch1st	ahhh that's where it gets fun - if there is conflict
2017-04-06 10:57:46	keveloper	Yeah
2017-04-06 10:57:52	keveloper	So there's something called CSS specificity
2017-04-06 10:57:54	tpanarch1st	what I know of Gantry is what I shove in custom.scss over-rides everything so I just need to keep my code tidy
2017-04-06 10:58:25	keveloper	ID (#) is the most specific
2017-04-06 10:58:49	keveloper	if you select by an id, the style in the block would override everything
2017-04-06 10:59:04	tpanarch1st	correct me if im wrong please, but an #id can be used multiple times and a class only once?
2017-04-06 10:59:12	keveloper	Other way around
2017-04-06 10:59:15	tpanarch1st	oooops haha
2017-04-06 10:59:20	keveloper	ID means what is says
2017-04-06 10:59:21	keveloper	identifier
2017-04-06 10:59:24	keveloper	it identifies an element
2017-04-06 10:59:26	keveloper	there can only be one
2017-04-06 10:59:36	keveloper	nobody else in Ohio has my license # yanno
2017-04-06 10:59:39	keveloper	that is my id
2017-04-06 10:59:51	tpanarch1st	not to be pedantic but what i've noticed with gantry is it does let me call it again and again over multiple templates
2017-04-06 10:59:53	tpanarch1st	sure :-D
2017-04-06 11:00:00	tpanarch1st	(it = class)
2017-04-06 11:00:06	keveloper	class would be like
2017-04-06 11:00:09	keveloper	im a hipster
2017-04-06 11:00:15	tpanarch1st	legend!
2017-04-06 11:00:15	keveloper	there can be tons of hipsters
2017-04-06 11:00:28	keveloper	.hipster { glasses: raybans; }
2017-04-06 11:00:33	keveloper	so all hipster have raybans
2017-04-06 11:00:33	keveloper	BUT
2017-04-06 11:00:39	keveloper	if i have that hipster class
2017-04-06 11:00:52	keveloper	then do #keveloper { glasses: oga; }
2017-04-06 11:00:59	keveloper	I wouldn't be wearing raybans anymore, I'd have ogas on
2017-04-06 11:01:26	tpanarch1st	oooh you confused me there
2017-04-06 11:01:29	tpanarch1st	i get the real life example
2017-04-06 11:01:30	keveloper	basically specificity goes: class > tag > id
2017-04-06 11:01:33	keveloper	from least to most speicfic
2017-04-06 11:01:42	tpanarch1st	if we take
2017-04-06 11:01:43	tpanarch1st	.hipster { glasses: raybans; 
2017-04-06 11:01:52	tpanarch1st	where does the colon come in to play please? 
2017-04-06 11:02:07	keveloper	ah right, i just pretended that was an attribute lol
2017-04-06 11:02:19	keveloper	.hister { color: red; } same thing
2017-04-06 11:02:20	tpanarch1st	ah like color: #1234;
2017-04-06 11:02:22	tpanarch1st	right!
2017-04-06 11:02:22	keveloper	yes
2017-04-06 11:02:23	tpanarch1st	sorry
2017-04-06 11:02:25	keveloper	sorry my b
2017-04-06 11:02:27	tpanarch1st	nooo
2017-04-06 11:02:29	tpanarch1st	it's ok!
2017-04-06 11:02:40	tpanarch1st	i just don't like to be the smart ass making assumptions
2017-04-06 11:02:51	keveloper	lol nbd
2017-04-06 11:03:00	tpanarch1st	just re-reading that last bit
2017-04-06 11:03:46	tpanarch1st	yeah i get that, cos if you are calling background-color you are not calling color 
2017-04-06 11:03:52	tpanarch1st	you do actually have to call what you want to change
2017-04-06 11:03:52	keveloper	OH NO i tought you wrong my bad
2017-04-06 11:03:57	keveloper	tag > class > id sorry
2017-04-06 11:04:03	keveloper	tag is least specific
2017-04-06 11:04:41	tpanarch1st	i get the theory but i'm just trying to image this in a way i can apply what you have told me
2017-04-06 11:04:59	keveloper	Soo on that site you sent
2017-04-06 11:05:11	tpanarch1st	i think i may be able to make an example here? :)
2017-04-06 11:05:52	keveloper	eh
2017-04-06 11:05:56	keveloper	these examples are complicated
2017-04-06 11:05:59	keveloper	Oh here we go
2017-04-06 11:06:15	keveloper	Right click on the top red bar and click inspect
2017-04-06 11:06:19	keveloper	it should put on the g-toplevel ul
2017-04-06 11:06:21	tpanarch1st	if I said .dog{color:#1234;} and then said #dog{color#4321}; I presume .dog wins and therefore the color is #1234
2017-04-06 11:06:31	keveloper	No other way around
2017-04-06 11:06:32	keveloper	#dog wins
2017-04-06 11:06:35	tpanarch1st	oh right ok!
2017-04-06 11:06:54	tpanarch1st	sure - just following your latest now...
2017-04-06 11:07:00	keveloper	go to the training page
2017-04-06 11:07:06	keveloper	right click on red bar, click inspect
2017-04-06 11:07:21	keveloper	The inspector should highligh <ul class="g-toplevel">
2017-04-06 11:07:24	tpanarch1st	yep i'm there (been there too much recently! :-) )
2017-04-06 11:07:32	keveloper	See the styles panel on the right
2017-04-06 11:07:32	tpanarch1st	it certainly does :)
2017-04-06 11:07:47	tpanarch1st	yeah i'm comfortable with getting there  -it's just interpreting it
2017-04-06 11:07:57	tpanarch1st	there btw 
2017-04-06 11:07:58	keveloper	Ok so the 3rd section down
2017-04-06 11:07:59	keveloper	it said
2017-04-06 11:08:10	keveloper	Wait sorry, 4th section down
2017-04-06 11:08:11	keveloper	it says
2017-04-06 11:08:17	tpanarch1st	how do you do 4th section
2017-04-06 11:08:19	keveloper	.g-main-nav ul
2017-04-06 11:08:23	tpanarch1st	how are you cutting this up please :)
2017-04-06 11:08:31	keveloper	There are very hard to see lines
2017-04-06 11:08:36	keveloper	lol
2017-04-06 11:08:45	keveloper	But you should see .g-main-nav ul
2017-04-06 11:08:46	tpanarch1st	jees that's a nightmare for me 
2017-04-06 11:08:49	tpanarch1st	but sure :)
2017-04-06 11:08:54	keveloper	and it sets margin to 0
2017-04-06 11:08:59	keveloper	right?
2017-04-06 11:09:35	tpanarch1st	is that the == $0
2017-04-06 11:09:45	keveloper	no
2017-04-06 11:09:50	keveloper	Look at the styles panel on the right
2017-04-06 11:09:54	keveloper	Youre looking at the markup :P
2017-04-06 11:10:26	tpanarch1st	ah this is where i am atm https://snag.gy/9TBEdo.jpg
2017-04-06 11:10:31	tpanarch1st	(screenshot)

2017-04-06 11:11:07	keveloper	click on the elipsis at the top next to the x of the inspector window
2017-04-06 11:11:16	keveloper	select the one that puts it on the bottom half of the screen
2017-04-06 11:11:38	keveloper	your styles panel is like 3px tall in that screen shot thats why you couldnt see anything lol
2017-04-06 11:12:11	tpanarch1st	i suppose "dock" :)
2017-04-06 11:12:21	keveloper	Yeah dockside

2017-04-06 11:13:43	keveloper	Oh you clicked the wrong x :O
2017-04-06 11:13:48	keveloper	lol
2017-04-06 11:13:51	tpanarch1st	oh i think i know what you mean!
2017-04-06 11:13:58	keveloper	:P
2017-04-06 11:14:11	tpanarch1st	you want me to be looking at this https://snag.gy/mgjPDJ.jpg
2017-04-06 11:14:12	tpanarch1st	:-p
2017-04-06 11:14:28	keveloper	yes woo
2017-04-06 11:14:38	tpanarch1st	awesome - process of eliminatin!
2017-04-06 11:14:44	tpanarch1st	elimination*
2017-04-06 11:14:44	keveloper	now right click on the red bar again and click inspect
2017-04-06 11:14:50	keveloper	get back to the ul element
2017-04-06 11:15:12	tpanarch1st	back there
2017-04-06 11:15:18	keveloper	ok
2017-04-06 11:15:26	keveloper	So on the right are all of the styles of that element
2017-04-06 11:15:34	tpanarch1st	yep
2017-04-06 11:15:36	keveloper	scroll down to like the 4th section
2017-04-06 11:15:38	keveloper	it will say
2017-04-06 11:15:42	keveloper	.g-main-nav ul
2017-04-06 11:15:48	keveloper	then some greyed out stuff
2017-04-06 11:15:50	keveloper	then margin: 0;
2017-04-06 11:15:52	keveloper	etc.
2017-04-06 11:16:07	keveloper	Like this: http://i.imgur.com/37c8v4X.png
2017-04-06 11:16:34	tpanarch1st	right i'm with you!
2017-04-06 11:16:39	tpanarch1st	took me a while to suss this out
2017-04-06 11:16:45	keveloper	See how that sets margin to 0
2017-04-06 11:16:48	tpanarch1st	yes :)
2017-04-06 11:16:53	keveloper	Now look at the section below it
2017-04-06 11:17:00	keveloper	thats a rule setting ul margin-left to 1.5rem
2017-04-06 11:17:03	keveloper	but its crossed out
2017-04-06 11:17:21	tpanarch1st	the margin-left and the padding are over-ridden by something else
2017-04-06 11:17:32	keveloper	correct
2017-04-06 11:17:39	keveloper	.g-main-nav ul
2017-04-06 11:17:44	keveloper	is more specific than just ul
2017-04-06 11:18:01	tpanarch1st	makes sense :)
2017-04-06 11:18:12	keveloper	so somewhere they just made the general rule that <ul> tags should have a margin-left of 1.5rem
2017-04-06 11:18:12	tpanarch1st	i wasn't sure before where to look for where it was being controlled from 
2017-04-06 11:18:14	tpanarch1st	but i get that
2017-04-06 11:18:42	keveloper	BUT if the ul is under .g-main-nav, then it shouuld have no margin
2017-04-06 11:18:47	tpanarch1st	yes :)
2017-04-06 11:18:49	keveloper	thats how typical overriding works
2017-04-06 11:18:49	tpanarch1st	whilst we are there
2017-04-06 11:19:15	keveloper	yep
2017-04-06 11:19:15	tpanarch1st	.g-main-nav ul, then has greyed out mobile stuff
2017-04-06 11:19:18	tpanarch1st	is it the same principle
2017-04-06 11:19:19	keveloper	right
2017-04-06 11:19:21	tpanarch1st	that is being controlled above
2017-04-06 11:19:29	keveloper	a comma is an or
2017-04-06 11:19:43	tpanarch1st	ah sweet, is it not more of an "and" here
2017-04-06 11:19:52	tpanarch1st	"let's control these both with the same values!
2017-04-06 11:19:54	tpanarch1st	"*
2017-04-06 11:20:07	keveloper	so it says "a ul the g main nav class OR an element with id g-mobilemenu-container with a ul under it"
2017-04-06 11:20:14	keveloper	right
2017-04-06 11:20:21	keveloper	so either one of those will ahve the same styling
2017-04-06 11:20:21	keveloper	BUT
2017-04-06 11:20:22	tpanarch1st	sweet ok!
2017-04-06 11:20:32	keveloper	the element you are on only applies to the first selector of the OR
2017-04-06 11:20:42	keveloper	so it grays out the ones that dont apply here for clarity
2017-04-06 11:20:49	tpanarch1st	that makes sense
2017-04-06 11:21:03	keveloper	But if you found yourself on #g-mobilemenu-container ul
2017-04-06 11:21:10	keveloper	then the .g-main-nav ul would be greyed out
2017-04-06 11:21:35	tpanarch1st	sure :)
2017-04-06 11:21:42	tpanarch1st	so in terms of the issue
2017-04-06 11:21:49	tpanarch1st	just looking back at my current incorrect code
2017-04-06 11:22:07	tpanarch1st	.g-main-nav a { .g-menu-item.active { background: #123456; }
2017-04-06 11:22:09	keveloper	right
2017-04-06 11:22:14	keveloper	do you understand why it is incorrect
2017-04-06 11:22:19	tpanarch1st	and just re-reading what you've said...
2017-04-06 11:22:40	tpanarch1st	well ul means unordered list right?
2017-04-06 11:23:00	keveloper	right but the only thing that really does is telling the browser to not put number in front of it
2017-04-06 11:23:06	keveloper	numbers*
2017-04-06 11:23:07	tpanarch1st	ahhh
2017-04-06 11:23:13	tpanarch1st	but we need a's belonging to them?
2017-04-06 11:23:24	keveloper	you dont 'need' them
2017-04-06 11:23:36	keveloper	<ul><li></li></ul> is valid markup
2017-04-06 11:23:37	tpanarch1st	oh right?
2017-04-06 11:23:42	keveloper	an <a> tag means "anchor"
2017-04-06 11:23:43	keveloper	which is a link
2017-04-06 11:23:49	tpanarch1st	yeah i appreciate that :)
2017-04-06 11:24:00	tpanarch1st	so is it that no a is specified to the far right of the selector
2017-04-06 11:24:18	tpanarch1st	hmmmm
2017-04-06 11:24:18	keveloper	well that, but also there's another issue
2017-04-06 11:24:36	tpanarch1st	i think .g-main-nav { .g-menu-item.active a { background: #123456; }
2017-04-06 11:24:38	keveloper	right
2017-04-06 11:24:40	keveloper	\o/
2017-04-06 11:24:49	keveloper	quick scss lesson
2017-04-06 11:25:00	keveloper	.g-main-nav .g-menu-item.active a {} would also work
2017-04-06 11:25:05	keveloper	the benefit of doing
2017-04-06 11:25:07	tpanarch1st	because we haven't kinda gone down the garden path enough to get hold of the wheelbarrow and there is no point in trying to grab the wheelbarrow when you are not in front of it?
2017-04-06 11:25:22	keveloper	sure lol
2017-04-06 11:25:24	keveloper	interesting way to put it
2017-04-06 11:25:31	tpanarch1st	I think about things in a silly way sometimes
2017-04-06 11:25:38	keveloper	the benefit of doing .g-main-nav { .g-menu-item.active a { background: #123456; }
2017-04-06 11:25:46	tpanarch1st	ok just digesting this next bit
2017-04-06 11:25:59	keveloper	is that if you have other styling under .g-main-nav you need
2017-04-06 11:26:04	keveloper	you only need to put .g-main-nav once
2017-04-06 11:26:50	tpanarch1st	hmmm
2017-04-06 11:27:12	tpanarch1st	so 1) is i think .g-main-nav { .g-menu-item.active a { background: #123456; }
2017-04-06 11:27:34	keveloper	You can do stuff like this: https://pastebin.com/DguajsRF
2017-04-06 11:27:35	tpanarch1st	2 is .g-main-nav .g-menu-item.active a {}
2017-04-06 11:27:39	keveloper	yes those both work
2017-04-06 11:27:49	tpanarch1st	so we are lacking a nesting situation
2017-04-06 11:27:54	keveloper	the first one is nice if you ever have other styling under .g-main-nav
2017-04-06 11:27:57	keveloper	like that pastebin
2017-04-06 11:28:01	tpanarch1st	ok :)
2017-04-06 11:28:15	tpanarch1st	is this all scss is btw
2017-04-06 11:28:19	keveloper	no
2017-04-06 11:28:20	tpanarch1st	shorthand css stuff :)
2017-04-06 11:28:21	tpanarch1st	ahhh
2017-04-06 11:28:26	keveloper	the ONLY scss thing we've talked about is the nesting
2017-04-06 11:28:31	keveloper	you can't do that in css
2017-04-06 11:28:39	keveloper	so that pastebin i sent is not valid css
2017-04-06 11:28:53	keveloper	.g-main-nav .g-menu-item.active {} is valid css however
2017-04-06 11:29:23	tpanarch1st	ah sweet, scss seems more natural somehow
2017-04-06 11:29:32	tpanarch1st	it just felt "right"
2017-04-06 11:29:50	keveloper	the pure css version of that pastebin is this: https://pastebin.com/SxEq7QVr
2017-04-06 11:30:06	keveloper	having .g-main-nav a bunch is annoying
2017-04-06 11:30:15	keveloper	That's one of the main problems scss solves
2017-04-06 11:30:46	tpanarch1st	so like
2017-04-06 11:31:08	tpanarch1st	got a question but i need to rearrange your pastebin :)
2017-04-06 11:31:30	keveloper	ok thats fine just clone it :P
2017-04-06 11:33:15	tpanarch1st	https://pastebin.com/inBxFyTQ
2017-04-06 11:33:27	tpanarch1st	so the change I have made, does that achieve the same in css?
2017-04-06 11:33:34	tpanarch1st	with one less section of code?
2017-04-06 11:33:46	keveloper	no
2017-04-06 11:34:03	keveloper	mine makes the actual .g-main-nav elements 50%
2017-04-06 11:34:15	keveloper	yours makes .g-menu-item.active 50% width
2017-04-06 11:34:50	tpanarch1st	ah cos the space isn't for selecting two at the same time equally, it's about the nearest tag to the right
2017-04-06 11:35:02	tpanarch1st	i just realised the error of my ways i think!
2017-04-06 11:35:12	keveloper	right
2017-04-06 11:35:15	keveloper	its for locating
2017-04-06 11:35:20	tpanarch1st	right! That makes a lot more sense!
2017-04-06 11:35:26	keveloper	if you want to select both equally
2017-04-06 11:35:27	keveloper	use ,
2017-04-06 11:35:29	tpanarch1st	i think in all of this, that was the biggest issue for me
2017-04-06 11:35:31	tpanarch1st	ahhhh!
2017-04-06 11:35:38	keveloper	.g-main-nav, .g-menu-item.active
2017-04-06 11:35:39	tpanarch1st	so i could have just used a comma (do you use spaces then)
2017-04-06 11:35:45	keveloper	but keep in mind that change the active selector
2017-04-06 11:35:58	keveloper	the .g-menu-item.active part is way less specific now
2017-04-06 11:36:05	keveloper	becuase it doesn't find a .g-main-nav first
2017-04-06 11:36:12	keveloper	to do that you'd do
2017-04-06 11:36:24	keveloper	.g-main-nav, .g-main-nav .g-menu-item.active
2017-04-06 11:36:39	keveloper	but you probably wouldn't want to apply the same css to both of  those :P
2017-04-06 11:36:50	tpanarch1st	ah that makes sense - the same principle could be applied either side of the comma
2017-04-06 11:36:55	tpanarch1st	IF you wanted the same values :)
2017-04-06 11:37:06	keveloper	righ
2017-04-06 11:37:12	keveloper	you can have as many commas as you want
2017-04-06 11:37:13	tpanarch1st	so you can stick a bath to one WHEN FINISHED , path to two
2017-04-06 11:37:18	tpanarch1st	path not bath*
2017-04-06 11:37:21	keveloper	h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 { font-weight: 500; }
2017-04-06 11:37:23	keveloper	for example
2017-04-06 11:37:30	tpanarch1st	that brings me neatly onto two other questions
2017-04-06 11:37:33	tpanarch1st	in my muddled learning
2017-04-06 11:37:33	keveloper	ok
2017-04-06 11:38:23	tpanarch1st	i'm a fan of h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, p, strong {color:#ffffff; background-color:#000000;}
2017-04-06 11:38:39	tpanarch1st	i'd have to look at my current code as i always forget where to shove the semi colon
2017-04-06 11:38:56	tpanarch1st	but essentially, i notice sometimes with when i get told to do something in gantry
2017-04-06 11:39:07	tpanarch1st	no id or class is used first
2017-04-06 11:39:11	keveloper	at the end of an setting an attribute
2017-04-06 11:39:12	tpanarch1st	so the line simply starts with h1....
2017-04-06 11:41:21	tpanarch1st	is that right sorry*
2017-04-06 11:41:25	tpanarch1st	not a very clear question
2017-04-06 11:41:35	tpanarch1st	also, so I think i'm right on this code .g-main-nav { .g-menu-item.active a { background: #123456; }
2017-04-06 11:44:11	keveloper	yes thats right
2017-04-06 11:44:25	tpanarch1st	ok, that code is still not doing it
2017-04-06 11:44:27	tpanarch1st	BUT
2017-04-06 11:44:30	tpanarch1st	I must confees
2017-04-06 11:44:39	keveloper	did you publish
2017-04-06 11:44:40	keveloper	i can debug
2017-04-06 11:44:41	tpanarch1st	confess - my custom.scss in such a horrible mess it is untrue!
2017-04-06 11:44:57	tpanarch1st	well, not to be lazy but would it be sensible to give you a pastebin of the whole custom.scss 
2017-04-06 11:45:00	tpanarch1st	it's not **huge**
2017-04-06 11:45:04	keveloper	okay i see it
2017-04-06 11:45:08	tpanarch1st	ahhhh :)
2017-04-06 11:45:13	keveloper	no chrome dev tools are all i need :P
2017-04-06 11:45:17	keveloper	its there
2017-04-06 11:45:19	tpanarch1st	ah sweet :-D
2017-04-06 11:45:47	keveloper	oh
2017-04-06 11:45:50	keveloper	pro-tip
2017-04-06 11:45:53	tpanarch1st	sweet :)
2017-04-06 11:45:54	keveloper	always use background-color
2017-04-06 11:45:58	keveloper	for setting colors
2017-04-06 11:46:02	tpanarch1st	how do you mean :)
2017-04-06 11:46:06	keveloper	background support way more tha njust colors
2017-04-06 11:46:08	tpanarch1st	even when it isn't needed?
2017-04-06 11:46:14	keveloper	background: #123456; is hort hand for
2017-04-06 11:46:22	keveloper	background-color: #123456;
2017-04-06 11:46:32	tpanarch1st	oh i usually do
2017-04-06 11:46:38	tpanarch1st	there's an odd one out there though!!
2017-04-06 11:47:04	keveloper	well whats happening is you set background but gantry has css that set the actual background-color so your css isn't applying
2017-04-06 11:47:31	keveloper	But even if you do change it I don't think its specific enough
2017-04-06 11:47:31	keveloper	try ti tho
2017-04-06 11:47:48	tpanarch1st	just updated that
2017-04-06 11:47:50	tpanarch1st	let's see
2017-04-06 11:48:00	tpanarch1st	nope :(
2017-04-06 11:48:05	keveloper	okay
2017-04-06 11:48:11	keveloper	so its crossed out now (booo)
2017-04-06 11:48:19	keveloper	meaning its being overridden by something more speicifc
2017-04-06 11:48:22	tpanarch1st	ah cac
2017-04-06 11:48:30	tpanarch1st	would it be easier if you had my custom.scss to hand?
2017-04-06 11:48:40	keveloper	nope :P
2017-04-06 11:48:52	tpanarch1st	is #g-offcanvas a {
2017-04-06 11:48:52	tpanarch1st		background-color: #a333c8;
2017-04-06 11:48:52	tpanarch1st	}
2017-04-06 11:48:54	tpanarch1st	relevant
2017-04-06 11:49:03	keveloper	One of the gantry classes is overridding it
2017-04-06 11:49:21	keveloper	with quite a honkin selector i must say
2017-04-06 11:49:23	keveloper	#g-navigation .g-main-nav .g-toplevel > li:not(.g-menu-item-type-particle):not(.g-menu-item-type-module).active > .g-menu-item-container {}
2017-04-06 11:49:36	tpanarch1st	oh right, that means, as i understand it, the structure of the css command in custom.scss is not calling it
2017-04-06 11:49:48	keveloper	your selector matches fine
2017-04-06 11:49:49	tpanarch1st	what the hell is not
2017-04-06 11:49:51	tpanarch1st	:)
2017-04-06 11:49:59	tpanarch1st	:not
2017-04-06 11:49:59	keveloper	not means what it soudns like
2017-04-06 11:50:05	keveloper	an li that does NOT have that class
2017-04-06 11:50:07	tpanarch1st	bloody hell that is messy
2017-04-06 11:50:13	keveloper	right
2017-04-06 11:50:20	keveloper	so thats more specific than your selector
2017-04-06 11:50:23	keveloper	there are two ways to fix this
2017-04-06 11:50:28	keveloper	one is really easy but bad practice
2017-04-06 11:50:34	keveloper	one is the "correct" way but is a little harder
2017-04-06 11:50:40	tpanarch1st	ah reet :)
2017-04-06 11:50:46	keveloper	1st option, throw !important on after the color
2017-04-06 11:50:52	keveloper	color: #123456 !important;
2017-04-06 11:51:00	keveloper	that will ignore specificity and just set it
2017-04-06 11:51:17	keveloper	the "correct" way would be to use a more specific selector
2017-04-06 11:51:18	tpanarch1st	does option 2 come into play if the hellish code had important already?
2017-04-06 11:51:34	tpanarch1st	or can you do !!important
2017-04-06 11:51:34	keveloper	option 2 is required if there was already important being used
2017-04-06 11:51:37	keveloper	no lmao
2017-04-06 11:51:38	tpanarch1st	ah sweet
2017-04-06 11:51:43	tpanarch1st	sorry, that would be too easy :-p
2017-04-06 11:51:48	keveloper	if important was already being used
2017-04-06 11:51:52	tpanarch1st	shame 
2017-04-06 11:51:53	tpanarch1st	:)
2017-04-06 11:51:58	keveloper	you need to make a more specific selector that ALSO uses important
2017-04-06 11:52:00	keveloper	lol
2017-04-06 11:52:23	tpanarch1st	actually would the important in the more specific selector be necessary anyway
2017-04-06 11:52:30	keveloper	no
2017-04-06 11:52:35	tpanarch1st	sweet :)
2017-04-06 11:52:40	keveloper	but some frameworks are bad and they use important in dumb places
2017-04-06 11:52:41	tpanarch1st	maybe i'm somehow getting the hang of this
2017-04-06 11:52:44	tpanarch1st	ahhh!
2017-04-06 11:52:46	keveloper	important is generally bad practice to use
2017-04-06 11:52:57	tpanarch1st	is gantry any good from what you've seen/are seeing
2017-04-06 11:53:26	keveloper	but i do not have to mental capacity at the moment to think of a selector more specific than that nightmare gantry is using
2017-04-06 11:53:29	keveloper	lol
2017-04-06 11:53:39	keveloper	lemme see if i can figure something out
2017-04-06 11:53:41	tpanarch1st	gut instinct is - normally, where something is expert level css/scss, they have a setting available in the GUI
2017-04-06 11:53:49	tpanarch1st	but i can't for love nor money find it!
2017-04-06 11:53:55	tpanarch1st	and i have asked them
2017-04-06 11:54:00	tpanarch1st	but no response for a day now
2017-04-06 11:55:05	tpanarch1st	they have this intermediary GUI to take us some way https://snag.gy/ZQvTkp.jpg
2017-04-06 11:55:23	tpanarch1st	so it seems they try and make the really hellish stuff a fair bit easier in theory
2017-04-06 11:55:47	tpanarch1st	but as to what an accent is or suchlike, well that's confusing
2017-04-06 11:56:13	keveloper	holy shit lol this is impossible
2017-04-06 11:56:15	keveloper	i tried section#g-navigation nav.g-main-nav > ul > li.g-menu-item.active > a
2017-04-06 11:56:20	keveloper	but its not specific enough
2017-04-06 11:56:26	keveloper	okay in weird circumstances like this
2017-04-06 11:56:35	tpanarch1st	keveloper i'm just wondering if there's a way within the GUI
2017-04-06 11:56:43	keveloper	especially where you are fighting with a frameowrk trying to override it
2017-04-06 11:56:46	keveloper	!important is okay to use
2017-04-06 11:56:49	tpanarch1st	fairs!
2017-04-06 11:56:54	tpanarch1st	will it work in all browsers?
2017-04-06 11:56:57	keveloper	yes
2017-04-06 11:57:10	tpanarch1st	ah sweet :) why should it be normally avoided please
2017-04-06 11:57:41	tpanarch1st	i guess because of a potential existing important
2017-04-06 11:57:50	keveloper	It makes it harder to override
2017-04-06 11:58:00	keveloper	also the 'c' in 'css' is 'cascading'
2017-04-06 11:58:08	keveloper	and the !important destroys the cascading part of that
2017-04-06 11:58:31	keveloper	it's like a last ditch effort hack to make something work generally
2017-04-06 11:58:35	tpanarch1st	ahhh :) 
2017-04-06 11:58:36	tpanarch1st	.g-main-nav { .g-menu-item.active a { background: #123456 !important; }
2017-04-06 11:58:52	keveloper	its okay here because it'd be pretty hard to find a selector that is more specific than that ridiuclous one
2017-04-06 11:59:03	keveloper	it says its coming from custom though
2017-04-06 11:59:08	keveloper	do you have that in there somewhere
2017-04-06 11:59:13	keveloper	#g-navigation .g-main-nav .g-toplevel > li:not(.g-menu-item-type-particle):not(.g-menu-item-type-module).active > .g-menu-item-container
2017-04-06 11:59:13	keveloper	that one
2017-04-06 11:59:24	tpanarch1st	my custom.scss is a total mess :)
2017-04-06 11:59:28	tpanarch1st	i need to work out a way of tidying it
2017-04-06 11:59:34	keveloper	well do a ctrl+f for that selector
2017-04-06 11:59:38	keveloper	see if you ahve it
2017-04-06 12:00:01	keveloper	if you do you can either A: delete it or B: just change the background-color defined there
2017-04-06 12:00:16	keveloper	otherwise stick with the important fix
2017-04-06 12:00:29	tpanarch1st	https://pastebin.com/7RjWDqzP
2017-04-06 12:00:34	tpanarch1st	i will do that two
2017-04-06 12:00:36	tpanarch1st	too*
2017-04-06 12:00:58	keveloper	uh oh
2017-04-06 12:01:03	keveloper	line 77 lol
2017-04-06 12:01:09	tpanarch1st	reeet :-p
2017-04-06 12:01:18	keveloper	change that #9ac0cd to whatever you want
2017-04-06 12:01:32	keveloper	why is that selector so gross
2017-04-06 12:01:58	tpanarch1st	its a mish mash of trying to get help to fix things :)
2017-04-06 12:02:02	keveloper	ah okay
2017-04-06 12:02:03	tpanarch1st	"/*added in for testing*/"
2017-04-06 12:02:05	tpanarch1st	duhhh
2017-04-06 12:02:09	keveloper	so yeah either delete that and use your new one
2017-04-06 12:02:09	tpanarch1st	one should have deleted it haha
2017-04-06 12:02:19	keveloper	or delete your new one and use that
2017-04-06 12:02:29	keveloper	im not sure what all of the not classes are for there but
2017-04-06 12:02:32	tpanarch1st	but then mine isn't working anyway i don't believe 
2017-04-06 12:02:44	tpanarch1st	it would be nice to avoid the important
2017-04-06 12:02:49	tpanarch1st	but i presume we have to use that?
2017-04-06 12:02:50	keveloper	there were like two things overriding it
2017-04-06 12:02:55	keveloper	i gtg to lunch
2017-04-06 12:03:07	tpanarch1st	sweet keveloper so we need the important essentially :)
2017-04-06 12:03:10	keveloper	try to find all of the .g-menu-item-container stuff setting background
2017-04-06 12:03:11	tpanarch1st	and thanks so much!
2017-04-06 12:03:17	keveloper	i'll be back in like 40
2017-04-06 12:03:21	tpanarch1st	sweet man :)
2017-04-06 12:03:24	tpanarch1st	thanks again!
2017-04-06 12:20:47	tpanarch1st	ok, commented out the section you did not want in custom.scss and currently active is the following:
2017-04-06 12:20:48	tpanarch1st	.g-main-nav {
2017-04-06 12:20:48	tpanarch1st		.g-menu-item.active a {
2017-04-06 12:20:49	tpanarch1st			background: #a333c8 !important;
2017-04-06 12:20:49	tpanarch1st		}
2017-04-06 12:20:49	tpanarch1st	}
2017-04-06 12:21:03	tpanarch1st	still not playing i'm afraid :)
2017-04-06 12:53:28	keveloper	hey
2017-04-06 12:56:43	tpanarch1st	hey man :)
2017-04-06 12:58:15	keveloper	is everything good
2017-04-06 12:58:30	tpanarch1st	did you see the above? :)
2017-04-06 12:58:39	tpanarch1st	still stuck i'm afraid
2017-04-06 12:58:42	tpanarch1st	i played around
2017-04-06 12:58:51	tpanarch1st	and then commented out the line you found in custom, used yours, changed the colour
2017-04-06 12:58:54	tpanarch1st	no joy though :)
2017-04-06 12:59:20	keveloper	its a new color
2017-04-06 13:00:21	keveloper	its working
2017-04-06 13:00:25	keveloper	what do you mean
2017-04-06 13:05:11	tpanarch1st	oh right keveloper now im confused
2017-04-06 13:05:18	keveloper	lol
2017-04-06 13:05:22	tpanarch1st	im still getting sky blue background
2017-04-06 13:05:40	tpanarch1st	https://snag.gy/uPdiKh.jpg
2017-04-06 13:06:23	keveloper	uh
2017-04-06 13:06:38	tpanarch1st	is it cross browser stuff?
2017-04-06 13:06:44	keveloper	no
2017-04-06 13:07:00	keveloper	http://www.gbgacademy.org.uk/training/
2017-04-06 13:07:02	keveloper	i see pink here
2017-04-06 13:08:54	tpanarch1st	now this is getting fun!
2017-04-06 13:09:20	tpanarch1st	what i don't get is why it isn't doing that across the whole install
2017-04-06 13:09:23	tpanarch1st	yes, your link has changed
2017-04-06 13:09:30	tpanarch1st	but i thought this was global
2017-04-06 13:09:37	keveloper	custom should be yeah
2017-04-06 13:09:43	keveloper	the markup might be different idk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-04-06 13:09:51	tpanarch1st	yeah this is really odd
2017-04-06 13:09:57	tpanarch1st	im just goingt o check one thing
2017-04-06 13:11:25	tpanarch1st	right, it's reading that from .topmenu
2017-04-06 13:11:49	tpanarch1st	cos .topmenu that i wrote in was called, since we've got rid of the crazy rule 
2017-04-06 13:12:12	tpanarch1st	so i presume from what you taught me, get rid of .topmenu
2017-04-06 13:12:17	tpanarch1st	and allow the other rule to take over?
2017-04-06 13:12:47	keveloper	i'm not sure it depepnds what .topmenu is doing
2017-04-06 13:15:02	tpanarch1st	ok keveloper let's just clear that out for a sec :)
2017-04-06 13:18:51	tpanarch1st	ok this is crazy
2017-04-06 13:19:02	tpanarch1st	so i've got rid of the #topmenu by commenting it out in scss
2017-04-06 13:19:11	tpanarch1st	and taking it out of the login page
2017-04-06 13:19:16	tpanarch1st	template
2017-04-06 13:19:33	tpanarch1st	the login page still has the right colour, however, when i log in, the sky blue is back
2017-04-06 13:19:37	tpanarch1st	cache has been cleared
2017-04-06 13:19:50	tpanarch1st	is there two similar but distinct situations here?
2017-04-06 13:20:42	keveloper	idk i'd ahve to see it
2017-04-06 13:21:17	tpanarch1st	i don't want to take you away from your work as you've given me a lot of time already but do you want a login?
2017-04-06 13:21:41	tpanarch1st	then you can get to that page
2017-04-06 13:21:54	tpanarch1st	or, alternatively, if you want me to do something and paste it
2017-04-06 13:22:03	tpanarch1st	if a certain line is different, for example
2017-04-06 13:22:45	tpanarch1st	in actual fact
2017-04-06 13:22:54	tpanarch1st	what is being called on this one that is still sky blue is as follows:
2017-04-06 13:22:55	tpanarch1st	#g-navigation .g-main-nav .g-toplevel > li:not(.g-menu-item-type-particle):not(.g-menu-item-type-module).active > .g-menu-item-container {
2017-04-06 13:22:55	tpanarch1st	    color: #000;
2017-04-06 13:22:55	tpanarch1st	    background-color: #9ac0cd;
2017-04-06 13:23:22	tpanarch1st	on the purple one
2017-04-06 13:23:24	tpanarch1st	-
2017-04-06 13:23:24	tpanarch1st	-
2017-04-06 13:23:26	tpanarch1st	#g-navigation .g-main-nav .g-toplevel > li:not(.g-menu-item-type-particle):not(.g-menu-item-type-module).active > .g-menu-item-container {
2017-04-06 13:23:26	tpanarch1st	    color: #1f004d;
2017-04-06 13:23:44	tpanarch1st	that's odd!
2017-04-06 13:24:26	keveloper	oh weird
2017-04-06 13:24:41	keveloper	hm
2017-04-06 13:24:45	tpanarch1st	although i have not used background-color again by the look of it
2017-04-06 13:24:48	keveloper	is that selector anywhere else in gantry
2017-04-06 13:25:07	keveloper	besides the one in custom that you took out
2017-04-06 13:25:14	tpanarch1st	not sure :(
2017-04-06 13:25:25	keveloper	thats odd
2017-04-06 13:25:36	tpanarch1st	it appears to call it the same way..
2017-04-06 13:25:39	keveloper	if you inspect and go to the styles panel it should tell you what file the rule comes form
2017-04-06 13:25:49	tpanarch1st	sure ok that makes sense
2017-04-06 13:26:09	tpanarch1st	so our purple is http://www.gbgacademy.org.uk/training/templates/g5_hydrogen/custom/css-compiled/hydrogen_14.css?58e677fb
2017-04-06 13:26:34	tpanarch1st	our blue is http://www.gbgacademy.org.uk/training/templates/g5_hydrogen/custom/css-compiled/custom_15.css?58e66310
2017-04-06 13:26:40	tpanarch1st	soooooo
2017-04-06 13:26:44	tpanarch1st	that tells us some interesting stuff
2017-04-06 13:26:55	tpanarch1st	it means the purple is coming from gantry itself
2017-04-06 13:27:02	tpanarch1st	and the blue is coming in from custom.css right?
2017-04-06 13:27:08	keveloper	looks like it
2017-04-06 13:27:15	tpanarch1st	bloody hell :(
2017-04-06 13:27:24	tpanarch1st	so our rule is not taking effect i think
2017-04-06 13:27:40	tpanarch1st	it's just that custom.scss is not getting in the way anymore
2017-04-06 13:28:33	tpanarch1st	i know a bad workman always blames his tools but it does rather feel half the issue is where their built in GUI colour changer not explaining what things do properly
2017-04-06 13:29:42	keveloper	idk this framework seems kinda bulky and messy
2017-04-06 13:32:45	tpanarch1st	yep :)
2017-04-06 13:52:02	tpanarch1st	it's crazy!
2017-04-06 13:52:16	keveloper	what is crazy
2017-04-06 13:52:33	tpanarch1st	trying to a change a simple value globally
2017-04-06 13:52:44	keveloper	yeah its normally not this hard lol
2017-04-06 13:52:59	tpanarch1st	not sure where to go now
2017-04-06 13:54:50	keveloper	just use important
2017-04-06 13:59:32	tpanarch1st	keveloper I am atm :)
