2015-11-18 15:25:19	frappuccino	what is aristotelianism
2015-11-18 15:25:20	frappuccino	idk
2015-11-18 15:25:23	frappuccino	i need to know
2015-11-18 15:26:01	abbyaha	The Aristotelian system allows formal defects leading to "bad metaphysics". For example, the following syllogism is permitted: "All golden mountains are mountains, all golden mountains are golden, therefore some mountains are golden", which insinuates the existence of at least one golden mountain.[30] Furthermore, according to Russell, a predicate of a predicate can be a predicate of the original subject,
2015-11-18 15:26:02	abbyaha	which blurs the distinction between names and predicates with disastrous consequences; for example, a class with only one member is erroneously identified with that one member, making impossible to have a correct theory of the number one.[31]
2015-11-18 15:26:04	abbyaha	The syllogism is overvalued in comparison to other forms of deduction. For example, syllogisms are not employed in mathematics since they are less convenient.[31]
2015-11-18 15:26:06	abbyaha	y
2015-11-18 15:26:56	abbyaha	its practical philosophy
2015-11-18 15:27:52	frappuccino	i need 50 more words
2015-11-18 15:29:45	abbyaha	therefore an aristoleian follower would say that by selling my kidney, as long as it is practical in that both i and the receiver benefit from it, i am morally right in my action
2015-11-18 15:30:13	abbyaha	theres 34

2016-02-15 12:14:52	frappuccino	thanks :D
2016-02-15 12:14:56	frappuccino	any ideas for it?
2016-02-15 12:15:01	frappuccino	im gonna do other stuff i think
2016-02-15 12:15:31	abbyaha	you could add in the asteroid belt?
2016-02-15 12:15:41	frappuccino	yeah i thought about that
2016-02-15 12:15:43	frappuccino	and moons
2016-02-15 12:15:49	frappuccino	like you click and it zooms in to the moons
2016-02-15 12:15:52	abbyaha	maybe have it so when you click on a planet it zooms in and shows the moon orbits
2016-02-15 12:15:58	frappuccino	lol ^
2016-02-15 12:16:01	abbyaha	lol yea that
2016-02-15 12:16:35	frappuccino	the only thing tecnically correct right now is the year length
2016-02-15 12:16:54	frappuccino	i.e. earth goes around 165 times when neptune goes around once
2016-02-15 12:17:17	frappuccino	i might do other specs about the planets or whatevz
2016-02-15 12:17:51	abbyaha	you could have a size scale on the bottom instead of making the actual scale of the orbiting planets true
2016-02-15 12:17:56	abbyaha	might make them hard to see
2016-02-15 12:19:02	abbyaha	but this does look super good, i am impressed
2016-02-15 12:19:46	frappuccino	yeah doing distances to scale is pretty hard
2016-02-15 12:19:47	frappuccino	thanks :D
2016-02-15 12:23:08	abbyaha	lol nathan is an ass, i asked him what he thought about it and he was like "Abby, do the planets orbit the sun in a perfect circle?"
2016-02-15 12:23:18	frappuccino	lol he's joking
2016-02-15 12:23:22	abbyaha	i know haha
2016-02-15 12:23:23	frappuccino	he already said that to me
2016-02-15 12:24:25	abbyaha	you should show stephen when he's back on, we didnt super know what it was from the snaps

2016-06-23 11:21:29	keveloper	although the teaser is sweet because it didn't show what the friend was until the end
2016-06-23 11:21:35	keveloper	and you only saw like a little flash of him
2016-06-23 11:21:51	abbyaha	yea, i hope this is super good and doesnt disappoint like where the wild things are

2016-06-27 13:53:06	keveloper	so you know how he reprogrammed the doors
2016-06-27 13:53:10	keveloper	to stay open on a power outage
2016-06-27 13:53:21	abbyaha	right
2016-06-27 13:53:28	keveloper	and thats how she got out
2016-06-27 13:53:40	abbyaha	okay
2016-06-27 13:54:26	keveloper	and then she left
2016-06-27 13:54:30	keveloper	and turned off the power
2016-06-27 13:54:33	keveloper	and he was locked in
2016-06-27 13:54:39	keveloper	why didn't the doors openm
2016-06-27 13:54:55	keveloper	my answer was "she knew about it so probably just programmed it back to the way it was"
2016-06-27 13:55:42	abbyaha	huh, yea, i think i kind of assumed that she reprogrammed it
2016-06-27 13:55:50	abbyaha	but i can see that being iffy
2016-06-27 13:56:02	keveloper	ya idk
2016-06-27 13:57:26	keveloper	oh... um
2016-06-27 13:57:33	keveloper	i just read a really really big plot hole
2016-06-27 13:57:34	keveloper	like
2016-06-27 13:57:38	keveloper	saddening
2016-06-27 13:57:43	keveloper	like "oh that would have been much better"
2016-06-27 13:57:45	keveloper	are you ready
2016-06-27 13:57:51	abbyaha	yea lol
2016-06-27 13:57:54	keveloper	'Caleb steals Nathan’s security card while he’s drunk and accesses the system to make it so all doors unlock in the case of a power failure. The doors usually lock down in the scenario, so after the change, Ava can easily walk out of the complex. The real question is, why didn’t Caleb just let her out with the security card? If he really intended to leave Nathan trapped in his own home, he could have
2016-06-27 13:57:54	keveloper	easily done so by taking his security card with him.'
2016-06-27 13:58:19	keveloper	...
2016-06-27 13:58:37	abbyaha	oooooohhh im on that site rn
2016-06-27 13:58:58	keveloper	Why the hell did a helicopter pilot take Ava from the estate?
2016-06-27 13:59:10	keveloper	im reading how it should've ended
2016-06-27 14:00:02	abbyaha	yea this site's idea is better
2016-06-27 14:03:09	keveloper	i ahvent read it
2016-06-27 14:11:26	keveloper	eh that ending sounds dumb
2016-06-27 14:11:32	keveloper	not any better than the real one
2016-06-27 14:11:34	abbyaha	idk i like it
2016-06-27 14:11:45	abbyaha	the comments have an interesting take on it

2016-08-05 10:21:18	abbyaha	i like the louis futon remix of it too
2016-08-05 10:21:31	keveloper	i havent heard

2016-08-05 10:21:51	abbyaha	it came up right after i was doen in gpm
2016-08-05 10:22:00	keveloper	listening
2016-08-05 10:22:21	keveloper	ooh that LFO on that synth tho dammn
2016-08-05 10:22:22	keveloper	i like
2016-08-05 10:22:37	abbyaha	idk what LFO is lol
2016-08-05 10:22:45	keveloper	the wub wub wub sound in sogs
2016-08-05 10:22:46	keveloper	songs
2016-08-05 10:22:48	keveloper	like in this remix
2016-08-05 10:22:50	abbyaha	oooooo
2016-08-05 10:23:42	keveloper	is a Low Frequency Oscillator controlling the filter cutoff frequency
2016-08-05 10:23:55	keveloper	so every sound is caused by an oscillator
2016-08-05 10:24:13	abbyaha	oooh thats cool! you should make more songs
2016-08-05 10:24:14	keveloper	but for instance A4 is 440Hz
2016-08-05 10:24:30	keveloper	we can hear down to 20Hz
2016-08-05 10:24:34	keveloper	(sorta)
2016-08-05 10:24:51	keveloper	but in this case the oscillating is speaker driver right
2016-08-05 10:24:55	keveloper	or whatever is vibrating
2016-08-05 10:24:59	keveloper	at whatever speed
2016-08-05 10:25:15	keveloper	so instead of oscillating a speaker to make noise
2016-08-05 10:25:15	abbyaha	thats interesting, thanks!
2016-08-05 10:25:18	keveloper	no im goin
2016-08-05 10:25:23	abbyaha	lol go on
2016-08-05 10:25:38	keveloper	you can oscillate some parameter
2016-08-05 10:26:07	keveloper	so a filter basically filters out frequency above or below a certain Hz value
2016-08-05 10:26:26	keveloper	so a low pass filter (LPF) only lets frequencies lower than the Hz value through
2016-08-05 10:26:35	keveloper	so you can automate that Hz value
2016-08-05 10:26:40	keveloper	to oscillate
2016-08-05 10:26:44	keveloper	at lets say a quarter not
2016-08-05 10:26:46	keveloper	note*
2016-08-05 10:27:08	keveloper	so every quarter note the Hz value of the filter will change 100Hz to 5000Hz or something
2016-08-05 10:27:14	keveloper	and THAT is what creates that wub wub wub noise
2016-08-05 10:27:27	keveloper	the same way you make the "wow" sound with your mouth
2016-08-05 10:27:44	keveloper	the smaller you make your moouth, the less high pitch over tones can escape
2016-08-05 10:27:47	keveloper	creating a LPF
2016-08-05 10:28:04	abbyaha	ooo okay, thats really cool. how did you learn all of this? classes or your own research?
2016-08-05 10:28:11	keveloper	both lol
2016-08-05 10:28:25	keveloper	music tech is p intense into shit like that lol
2016-08-05 10:28:40	keveloper	i learned how to do the wub wub wub thing before college
2016-08-05 10:28:50	abbyaha	yea i can imagine, its cool in any case to know how it works

2016-08-15 10:38:22	abbyaha	so, i have to go to therapy once a week for OCD, and i discussed it with matt and everything is chill, but should i say anything to the team, or let it just be a recurring appt i have? 
2016-08-15 10:39:34	keveloper	Hmm... I guess just a recurring appt
2016-08-15 10:39:37	keveloper	They don't need to know

2016-08-15 10:40:21	abbyaha	yea i wouldnt be specific if i did say something, i just didnt know whether i should address it like "hey i have an appt every week" or just send the calendar thing
2016-08-15 10:40:42	abbyaha	and ideally itll be fridays at 9, but itll be about a month before its that regular
2016-08-15 10:41:42	keveloper	yeah i'd just keep scheduling appt on calendar i guess
