2017-09-22 11:08:57	keveloper	I'm sorry though I can't imagine :(
2017-09-22 11:10:15	catfriend	it was a  huge shock. he just had a heart attack in his sleep i guess. my mom didnt even realize til the morning 
2017-09-22 11:11:02	keveloper	That's bizarre.. how old was he?
2017-09-22 11:11:11	catfriend	66
2017-09-22 11:11:37	catfriend	he was really active though, still worked a job on his feet all day, walked the dog all day, household repairs, he was constantlky on the go and saw a dr regularly, got blood work monthly etc

2017-09-22 11:12:38	keveloper	I'm sorry you have to go through this :(

2017-09-22 11:13:00	catfriend	very peaceful. my mom didnt even wake up
2017-09-22 11:13:10	catfriend	so at least we have that. he didnt have to be sick or suffer or be scared
2017-09-22 11:13:13	keveloper	That's good at least right?
2017-09-22 11:13:14	catfriend	he went to sleep like it was a regular night
2017-09-22 11:13:21	catfriend	yeah
2017-09-22 11:13:23	keveloper	Yeah, he died happy :)
2017-09-22 11:13:52	catfriend	and its crazy we kinda found out he had this whole life we barely knew about. we'd ask him how work was and he would say "busy" or "slow" and thats the extent of it . we knew he was well liked at work but didnt kjnow the extent of it
2017-09-22 11:13:59	catfriend	he stocked shelves at a grocery store
2017-09-22 11:14:08	keveloper	Really?
2017-09-22 11:14:12	catfriend	so many customers came to his wake and funeral crying sayin g how much they loved him and he was the bvest part of their day
2017-09-22 11:14:22	catfriend	the store closed for the wake and funeral so all the employees could go
2017-09-22 11:14:38	catfriend	and there was just this outpouringf from customers/coworkers about how great he was and how much they loved him
2017-09-22 11:15:01	keveloper	That's awesome
2017-09-22 11:15:13	catfriend	to the point where like teenage girls on twitter were posting prom pictures with him, they made sure to drop in the grocery store to get theior prom pic taken with him before prom
2017-09-22 11:15:17	catfriend	some of the cashiers
2017-09-22 11:15:21	catfriend	and they basically saw him like a dad
2017-09-22 11:15:34	keveloper	The best thing to do is celebrate his life :)
2017-09-22 11:15:38	catfriend	but dad was so humble so he';d never tell us this stuff lol 
2017-09-22 11:15:58	keveloper	How old are you again?

2017-09-22 11:16:15	keveloper	Okay that's what I thought
2017-09-22 11:16:30	keveloper	I'm sorry :/ That's too young to lose a parent
2017-09-22 11:16:37	catfriend	yeah
2017-09-22 11:16:42	keveloper	You don't deserve to have to go through that

2017-09-22 11:17:00	catfriend	and were gettinbg the house ready to sell
2017-09-22 11:17:03	keveloper	That's crazy
2017-09-22 11:17:06	keveloper	:/
2017-09-22 11:17:23	catfriend	and she was convinced she would die first so him dying just wasnt on her radar 
2017-09-22 11:17:50	keveloper	:(
2017-09-22 11:17:52	keveloper	I can't imagine that
2017-09-22 11:19:05	keveloper	He sounds like he did pretty good though :) Even if 66 isn't as long as it could've been yanno?
2017-09-22 11:19:09	catfriend	my moms been through so much too like i cant imagine. she lost her dad at 15. her mom at 40. her brother when he was only 38. she lost 2 kids before i was born. 
2017-09-22 11:19:13	catfriend	but she always had her husband 
2017-09-22 11:19:17	catfriend	so shes just a mess 
2017-09-22 11:19:24	keveloper	:(
2017-09-22 11:20:05	catfriend	and yeah dad had a happy life, he was a simple guy didnt want much, he died peacefully, i can find peace in that. last year one of my best friends lost her dad but he killed himself 
2017-09-22 11:20:13	catfriend	and thats 100000000x worse than what im going through
2017-09-22 11:20:21	catfriend	i met up with her the other day to get dinner and go see a movie
2017-09-22 11:20:44	keveloper	Yeah, my sisters dad killed himself 3 years ago because of hearing damage (he was a jazz pianist) and that was a whole mess :/
2017-09-22 11:21:07	catfriend	yeha its terrible like i cant imagine knowing my dad was so unhappy before he died 
2017-09-22 11:21:09	catfriend	it would make it so muc hworse
2017-09-22 11:21:54	keveloper	I'm glad your dad died happily and peacefully then :)
2017-09-22 11:22:02	keveloper	Wow that could seem bad out of context but
2017-09-22 11:22:08	keveloper	You know what I mean :P
2017-09-22 11:22:14	keveloper	It's the best the situation could be yanno?
2017-09-22 11:22:36	catfriend	yeah haha i know what you mean
2017-09-22 11:22:48	catfriend	if anyone deserved to die peacefully in their sleep with no pain or suffering, its him
