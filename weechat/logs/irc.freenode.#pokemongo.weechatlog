2016-07-15 10:59:23	Tennis	yeah blaziken311 8000 i think because its lvl 4 gym
2016-07-15 10:59:25	YetiMaster5000	When I leveled up my vaporeon twice, the first one gave me 70 cp the first time
2016-07-15 10:59:31	YetiMaster5000	And like 28 the second time
2016-07-15 10:59:31	tinyhippo	Mew: does it do the same if you are training there?
2016-07-15 10:59:38	Mew	I think so
2016-07-15 10:59:41	blaziken311	oh Tennis it says 4000 / 8000
2016-07-15 10:59:46	blaziken311	so what do those numbers mean
2016-07-15 10:59:50	Mew	I think any battle shows that animation (from what I've seen)
2016-07-15 10:59:53	Tennis	means it can be ranked higher
2016-07-15 10:59:55	gamozo	YetiMaster5000: these charts should be averages
2016-07-15 10:59:57	gamozo	there's some variance
2016-07-15 10:59:59	blaziken311	I see
2016-07-15 11:00:01	blaziken311	thanks
