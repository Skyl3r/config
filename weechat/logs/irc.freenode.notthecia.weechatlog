2017-10-18 10:08:19	keveloper	Okay so you asked last night "howre things on your end?" which made it seem like you think I'm working on something for you right now
2017-10-18 10:08:32	keveloper	So I'm confused if that was the case because I am not working on anything currently
2017-10-18 10:08:32	NotTheCIA	naw, life in general
2017-10-18 10:08:37	keveloper	Okay phew
2017-10-18 10:08:47	NotTheCIA	i was a bit too bored yesterday
2017-10-18 10:08:51	keveloper	Ooooh lol
2017-10-18 10:09:03	keveloper	'hows things on your end' sounds like "how close are you to done with the work" lol
2017-10-18 10:09:11	keveloper	phew
2017-10-18 10:09:18	NotTheCIA	need to probably break down the work i'm doing a little more because i just end up goofing around on FGO instead

2017-10-18 10:09:23	NotTheCIA	halloween event

2017-10-18 10:10:18	NotTheCIA	it's on CloudAtCost
2017-10-18 10:10:23	keveloper	Why does that happen so often lol
2017-10-18 10:10:31	NotTheCIA	look at their business model
2017-10-18 10:10:37	NotTheCIA	it's not very surprising
2017-10-18 10:10:51	keveloper	http://cloudatcost.com/
2017-10-18 10:10:56	keveloper	some one asked
2017-10-18 10:11:00	NotTheCIA	correct
2017-10-18 10:11:06	keveloper	'how many fonts can we have in one graphic?'
2017-10-18 10:11:30	keveloper	I think i count 6 fonts
2017-10-18 10:12:20	keveloper	$35 one time
2017-10-18 10:12:29	NotTheCIA	exactly
2017-10-18 10:12:37	keveloper	wtf
2017-10-18 10:12:46	keveloper	unmetered monthly transfer
2017-10-18 10:12:49	keveloper	is the uptime bad
2017-10-18 10:13:05	NotTheCIA	you're not going to get high quality service with one time charges of that level
2017-10-18 10:13:19	NotTheCIA	it seems to be more like 99% uptime
2017-10-18 10:14:03	NotTheCIA	the 99.9% SLA they claim to have is only for the final 2 tiers if memory serves
2017-10-18 10:14:22	keveloper	99% isn't toooo bad
2017-10-18 10:14:29	keveloper	i could host my minecraft server on there at least lol
2017-10-18 10:14:32	NotTheCIA	if you flip over to production servers, that's where they have actual SLA guarantees
2017-10-18 10:14:33	keveloper	i need to get that off of asteria
2017-10-18 10:14:37	NotTheCIA	because it's monthly
2017-10-18 10:14:46	keveloper	(asteria is the server i use for weechat/pernt/porfolio)
2017-10-18 10:15:21	keveloper	lol do they make these graphics in word jfc
2017-10-18 10:20:25	keveloper	lol 70% off im about to buy this

2017-10-18 10:27:57	NotTheCIA	haha
2017-10-18 10:28:11	NotTheCIA	now to wait like four weeks for them to provision it
2017-10-18 10:28:30	NotTheCIA	if memory serves correctly from kerrang's and GothAlice's experience
2017-10-18 10:29:10	keveloper	lol rip
