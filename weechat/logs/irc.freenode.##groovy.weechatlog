2017-10-12 19:15:19	robnester_	is it possible to take a map and create vars from the map keys?
2017-10-12 19:16:21	robnester_	like a = [b:'foo', c:'bar'] and then do something (i tried a.collect{k,v return k=v} which didn't work) which would allow me to access b as a variable?
2017-10-12 19:41:21	robnester_	anyone?

2017-10-13 07:02:12	NET||abuse	hey guys, i'm doing a lot of jenkins these days, i'm looking to get my head around groovy for pipelines, is this the best community to learn from? Or is there other jenkins dsl specific groovy groups worth talking to?
2017-10-13 07:02:57	NET||abuse	And otherwise, I want to find a way to test out scripts locally more easily, is there a versin manager for groovy like rvm for ruby, or virtualenv for python?
2017-10-13 07:03:04	ridcully	if you have groovy specific questions here is fine.  jenkins you can try.  but mention it
2017-10-13 07:03:21	NET||abuse	ok cool, thanks ridcully
2017-10-13 07:03:25	ridcully	just because jenkins uses groovy somehow not always means, groovy knowledge applies
2017-10-13 07:04:11	ridcully	if you want to run scripts for testing you can install a local version of groovy with e.g. sdkman or download it from the homepage
2017-10-13 07:04:21	ridcully	that should contain the groovysh and groovyConsole
2017-10-13 07:04:41	NET||abuse	i'm on arch, i've found groovy in the community repo at 2.4.12
2017-10-13 07:04:41	ridcully	groovysh is a classic REPL and the console is some swing or similar UI
2017-10-13 07:05:03	ridcully	and you can run your scripts with `groovy script.groovy`
2017-10-13 07:05:27	NET||abuse	hmm, wondering how to check what groovy jenkins is running.
2017-10-13 07:06:08	ridcully	i'd go and find out, if its using the same minor (e.g. 2.4 is current)
2017-10-13 07:06:55	ridcully	it's very unlikely you run into groovy specific problems between the 2.4 different patch level versions
2017-10-13 07:07:12	NET||abuse	yeh, pulling the latest image and shell in and see if i can invoke groovy and get a version
2017-10-13 07:10:41	NET||abuse	hmm, no groovy package in dpkg on the jenkins img.
2017-10-13 07:11:46	ridcully	do you mean the docker image of it?
2017-10-13 07:12:39	ridcully	i have not used jenkins since forever, but i strongly doubt, that jenkins would use a local groovy installation
2017-10-13 07:13:05	ridcully	the groovy.jars are part of the jenkins build itself
2017-10-13 07:13:45	NET||abuse	yes, i think you are right, so only way i know how to test is with some groovy code to show it's version in the jeknins/script page
2017-10-13 07:15:17	ridcully	if you want to locally write test code like "read all files from a directory and build some property map"-level-of-things i strongly doubt, you will see any difference in what ever 2.x version you are using
2017-10-13 07:16:12	NET||abuse	ok, jenins 2.78 seems to be using 2.4.11
2017-10-13 07:16:51	NET||abuse	yep, jenkins 2.67 also already on 2.4.11,so they're very up to date

2017-10-13 09:46:07	NET||abuse	hmm, ok, i've tried using HttpURLConnection to make an api request to artifactory, but it turns out setReuestProperty("X-JFrog-Art-Api", Token) wont work since the docker api auth on artifactory is broken with tokens, only usre:password basic auth will work
2017-10-13 09:46:50	NET||abuse	so i'm tryin gto use setRequestProperty("Authorization", "Basic " + encodeduserpassw)  but i'm not sure how to encode the user:password combo
2017-10-13 09:47:43	ridcully	does this help? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7019997/preemptive-basic-auth-with-httpurlconnection
2017-10-13 09:49:04	ridcully	in the end groovy is half of the time just de-boilerplated-java.  so also searching for a java solution might bring up more results.  and its close enough most of the time to be able to just copy'npaste the java code
2017-10-13 09:51:27	NET||abuse	yeh , alot of java style solutions are shown, i'm getting an error there:
2017-10-13 09:51:27	NET||abuse	groovy.lang.MissingPropertyException: No such property: StandardCharsets for class: Script1
2017-10-13 09:52:32	ridcully	you have to import that
2017-10-13 09:52:53	ridcully	those java examples, that actually include the imports are the real MVPs
2017-10-13 09:57:27	NET||abuse	yay, that worked.

2017-10-13 10:11:40	NET||abuse	hmm, the example on one site says there's a .text attribute of a URL object, but i'm using HttpURLConnection, so how do i get the content out of it?
