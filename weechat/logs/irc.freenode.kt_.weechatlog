2017-09-22 17:33:28	keveloper	sup why u bored
2017-09-22 17:34:05	kt_	tired of working on the same damn thing for 5 months
2017-09-22 17:34:11	keveloper	what is it
2017-09-22 17:34:17	kt_	Institution Registry
2017-09-22 17:34:43	kt_	everything was fine but then we decided to do away with selenium server and use chromdriver and we also updated watir webdriver and it broke everything
2017-09-22 17:35:13	keveloper	:(
2017-09-22 17:35:14	kt_	and now all the tests are failing again due to whatever reasons... and months ago I figured out like 8 different ways of doing something until one way finally worked and now I have to do that again
2017-09-22 17:35:23	kt_	I'm just frustrated. I know I shouldn
2017-09-22 17:35:29	kt_	shouldnt be because I'm an intern
2017-09-22 17:35:37	keveloper	eh
2017-09-22 17:35:41	keveloper	whyd you guys migrate
2017-09-22 17:35:47	kt_	I don't know
2017-09-22 17:36:34	keveloper	sounds pointless
2017-09-22 17:36:44	kt_	I know right
2017-09-22 17:37:12	keveloper	why did things break
2017-09-22 17:37:21	keveloper	like bugs in chromedrier?
2017-09-22 17:37:45	kt_	there's new ways of selecting things so you can't do like select_list = option. that's fine and was easy to fix
2017-09-22 17:38:17	kt_	also chromedriver doesn't scroll the same way that watir did when that was the main webdriver I guess? 
2017-09-22 17:39:17	kt_	so that's causing things to fail
2017-09-22 17:39:32	kt_	and I also can't figure out why Watir is flat out just not finding things sometimes
2017-09-22 17:40:35	kt_	I ran all of the tests on my machine and all of them passed which is awesome bc they don't do that very often but it doesn't pass on Jenkins and Jenkins is what matters
2017-09-22 17:40:35	keveloper	yeah scrolling with ui tests suck
2017-09-22 17:40:45	keveloper	i gotta go eat dinner lol

2017-10-16 16:53:38	keveloper	she had one of those blogs

2017-10-16 16:53:44	kt_	I try to stay away from that kind of thing bc it should not be glorified holy shit
2017-10-16 16:53:57	keveloper	so yeah she cut her self a lot and after two years i got her to stop
2017-10-16 16:54:03	keveloper	afaik she has still stopped
2017-10-16 16:54:12	keveloper	but she would threaten to cut herself when she got mad or upset with me

2017-10-16 16:54:51	kt_	i meaaaan it's still cool that you were there for her instead of like shrugging it off or something
