2016-05-24 14:15:41	frappi	#discodevs
2016-12-20 09:57:30	keveloper	reshoots?
2016-12-20 09:57:38	keveloper	yeah the last 1/3 was better than the first 2/3s
2016-12-20 09:57:51	keveloper	i honestly thought it was going to be bad movie after the first 15 minutes
2016-12-20 09:58:02	keveloper	it was jumping all over the place
2016-12-20 09:58:03	Rothlan	the executives saw the film and ordered a ton of reshoots, some reshoots are normal but they changed a lot according to rumors
2016-12-20 09:58:25	Rothlan	yeah, the whole saw story seemed really abrupt and incomplete
2016-12-20 09:58:27	keveloper	i think the second half was incredible
2016-12-20 09:58:58	Rothlan	what point did the 2nd half start for you?
2016-12-20 09:59:14	keveloper	when they arrive at ... uhhh rainy planet haha
2016-12-20 09:59:21	keveloper	eadu?
2016-12-20 09:59:59	keveloper	I really like the scene of jetta being destroyed though
2016-12-20 10:00:27	Rothlan	yeah, the story seemed to smooth out after that point, the battle scenes were all incredible and I appreciated the darker tone without going overboard and making the good guys as bad as the bad guys
2016-12-20 10:00:53	keveloper	The "terrorist" type group was really interesting
2016-12-20 10:00:54	Rothlan	was a little sad they killed off everyone, but the wife actually liked that
2016-12-20 10:01:05	keveloper	Interesting perspective on rebels in star wars
2016-12-20 10:01:12	Rothlan	and of course Vader...
2016-12-20 10:01:22	keveloper	Yeah, but then again they had to kill of everyone because they wouldve been a big deal, but they werent in the later movie
2016-12-20 10:01:58	keveloper	Vader's entrance onto that ship oh wow
2016-12-20 10:02:04	Rothlan	I've heard that arguement, not really sure it holds up cause in the EU with the books and everything there were lots of heroes that didn't get mentioned in the main storyline, but it's fine
2016-12-20 10:02:05	keveloper	I was like :o :o :o
2016-12-20 10:02:31	keveloper	I thought it was kind of inspiring how they all died to get the plans... sad but yeah I think it was good for ths tory
2016-12-20 10:02:46	keveloper	hammerhead corvette; best part of the battles
2016-12-20 10:02:49	keveloper	that was so sick
2016-12-20 10:03:03	Rothlan	yeah, Vader just cutting through those troops like butter and the absolute terror you could see the troopers had
2016-12-20 10:03:12	Rothlan	oh yeah, that was aweseome too
2016-12-20 10:03:30	keveloper	The star destroyers crashing into to eachother was epic
2016-12-20 10:03:45	keveloper	Yeah vader entering that hallway was terrifying, much more terrifying than the original movies
2016-12-20 10:04:11	keveloper	I was even afraid that they weren't gonna get the plans through even when I knew they were going to haha
2016-12-20 10:04:20	keveloper	The tension was amazing
2016-12-20 10:04:41	Rothlan	lol, yeah, same here, I didn't understand, there was no way they were going to stop Vader, it had to be all over
2016-12-20 10:05:06	keveloper	As soon as I saw the tantive I was like ":o OMG ITS AT THAT PART" hahaha
2016-12-20 10:05:14	keveloper	such a good lead into the 4th movie
2016-12-20 10:05:47	Rothlan	yeah, I actually watched the Episode 4 the other night, just a couple nights after seeing Rogue One
2016-12-20 10:05:55	keveloper	Ahh I should've done that
2016-12-20 10:06:08	Rothlan	some people went home and did that
2016-12-20 10:06:13	keveloper	That would've been great
2016-12-20 10:06:16	Rothlan	yeah
2016-12-20 10:06:20	keveloper	I'm seeing it again this week
2016-12-20 10:06:50	Rothlan	now I'm bouncing around waiting for Ep 8 :)
2016-12-20 10:07:06	keveloper	yeah I'm so excited
2016-12-20 10:07:14	keveloper	Disney is doing a *great* job with this lol
2016-12-20 10:07:17	Rothlan	not sure how I feel about the young Han Solo movie, hopefully it turns out well
2016-12-20 10:07:23	keveloper	I hope yeah
2016-12-20 10:07:37	keveloper	They made this one look so real
2016-12-20 10:07:48	keveloper	I have never been so entangled with a star wars movie before
2016-12-20 10:08:02	Rothlan	yeah, I just read on Reddit Disney just became the first ever studio to hit $7 Billion at the Global Box Office
2016-12-20 10:08:13	keveloper	wow
2016-12-20 10:08:16	Rothlan	Between Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar...they're doing well
2016-12-20 10:08:29	keveloper	Jeez I didn't realize that lol
2016-12-20 10:08:50	keveloper	Oh I remember one thing I hated
2016-12-20 10:09:04	keveloper	What the hell was up with that opening and closing door thing at the top of the tower?!
2016-12-20 10:09:12	keveloper	It was just like a video game obstacle in the middle of a movie
2016-12-20 10:09:15	keveloper	it was the most bizarre thing
2016-12-20 10:09:24	keveloper	Why the hell would that be at the top of that building
2016-12-20 10:10:03	Rothlan	hehe, yeah.  air vent malfunctioning maybe?  but I do know the wife was impressed with her upper body strength, maybe that was it's only purpose, to show she's a strong woman?  I don't know
2016-12-20 10:10:20	keveloper	I think we already knew she was strong lol
2016-12-20 10:11:04	keveloper	Like maybe it release air or something to keep a certain pressure in the data place
2016-12-20 10:11:08	keveloper	idfk, i thought it was useless
2016-12-20 10:11:26	Rothlan	yeah, it was just to add tension, but it does seem kinda silly thinking about it
2016-12-20 10:11:40	keveloper	OH! And there was that shot of the tie fighter meeting jen on the edge of the catwalk on top of the tower in the trailer
2016-12-20 10:11:47	keveloper	I was waiting for that shot, never happened
2016-12-20 10:12:14	Rothlan	yeah, several scenes and lines of dialogue were missing, reshoots changed the final product
2016-12-20 10:12:26	Rothlan	wish I could've seen it before
2016-12-20 10:12:31	keveloper	https://youtu.be/frdj1zb9sMY?t=1m43s
2016-12-20 10:12:32	keveloper	this shot
2016-12-20 10:12:35	keveloper	I was so pumped for it
2016-12-20 10:12:51	keveloper	But apparently they changed it :'(
2016-12-20 10:14:13	Rothlan	oh, were the cgi faces bad for you too?  my friend's wife and Lexie didn't notice it, but Alex and I really did.
2016-12-20 10:14:25	Rothlan	probably cause of all the video games we play so we knew what to look for
2016-12-20 10:14:31	keveloper	I didn't notice anything
2016-12-20 10:14:35	keveloper	Was that really carrie fisher?
2016-12-20 10:14:54	keveloper	oh no it was not wow
2016-12-20 10:14:56	Rothlan	no, both Tarkin and Leia were played by random actors and cgi faces painted on
2016-12-20 10:15:05	keveloper	ahh
2016-12-20 10:15:09	keveloper	yeah tarkin looked a little weird
2016-12-20 10:15:16	keveloper	same with leia but i thought she looked better
2016-12-20 10:15:19	Rothlan	Tarkin seemed really obvious to me, Leia was too short to really notice
2016-12-20 10:15:23	Rothlan	yeah
2016-12-20 10:15:47	keveloper	i thought tarkin's face looked a little off but it wasn't too distracting or anything
2016-12-20 10:15:53	keveloper	I just thought "they tried" lol
2016-12-20 10:16:07	keveloper	http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/c/c1/Tarkininfobox.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100620213033
2016-12-20 10:16:15	keveloper	tbf thats a pretty hard face to replicate lol
2016-12-20 10:17:17	Rothlan	yeah, I think it would've helped if they kept it shorter and did more shots without his face, it was just a little plasticy and weird, especially around the eyes.
2016-12-20 10:17:55	keveloper	Yeah I noticed that
2016-12-20 10:17:58	keveloper	I thought Krennic was great
2016-12-20 10:17:58	Rothlan	but overall I gave the movie a B, if they did a better job with the first half, def an A+
2016-12-20 10:18:35	keveloper	The idea of his own weapon killing him and the shot to demonstrate that was really good
2016-12-20 10:18:52	Rothlan	my friend Alex really didn't like it, said he wasn't even planning on buying the Blu Ray (he collects lots of them)  but then his wife said she was going to get it. :)  Both our wives liked it better than us, the fans!
2016-12-20 10:19:16	Rothlan	yeah, the look on Krennic's face was great
2016-12-20 10:19:39	keveloper	Yeah, I'm still gonna see it again, I liked it despite the first half.. The ending was just so good
2016-12-20 10:19:49	Rothlan	I think there was another missing scence that was in the trailer with him, him walking on the water or something
2016-12-20 10:19:56	Rothlan	Krennic*
2016-12-20 10:20:02	keveloper	I might still be in fantasy wonderland of amazement to realize its bad yet haha
2016-12-20 10:20:36	keveloper	Jyn and cassian(?) looked way too content with dying at the end
2016-12-20 10:20:37	Rothlan	nah, it was a good movie, the beginning just bothered me more than you
2016-12-20 10:21:15	keveloper	No sane human would just sit there like that
2016-12-20 10:22:02	Rothlan	yeah, they seemed like fighters to the end, maybe they just realized it was the end and accepted it.  not sure if that really fit their personalities.  course they might have realized this was a one way trip a while ago
2016-12-20 10:24:10	keveloper	I like how we didn't know the craziness that happened right before the intro to the first movie
2016-12-20 10:24:46	Rothlan	yeah, they tied it in really well, we had no idea all that had JUST happened
2016-12-20 10:25:10	keveloper	OH! when vader's fleet block the other fleet's jump to hyperspace
2016-12-20 10:25:12	keveloper	that was SO COOL
2016-12-20 10:25:21	keveloper	there were a lot of really cool space battle ideas
2016-12-20 10:25:40	Rothlan	yeah, I was like what does Tarkin mean, Vader will take care of it...and then I was like, oh...yeah, that will do it
2016-12-20 10:26:07	keveloper	vader's castle was a bit weird
2016-12-20 10:26:16	keveloper	but apparently that's a thing
2016-12-20 10:27:11	keveloper	seem's a pretty impractical home planet for someone that injured lol

2017-06-27 14:20:13	keveloper	so unless I'm mistaken thats ~ 64 * 365, so an extra $23k a year?
2017-06-27 14:20:37	Rothlan	hopefully, you never no what will happen with prices and hash difficulty though
2017-06-27 14:20:50	Rothlan	I think I'll get about 9 months out of them before it will be best to sell the 6 extra
2017-06-27 14:20:57	keveloper	Well yeah but, you'll definitely break even at this rate
2017-06-27 14:21:08	keveloper	6 extra?
2017-06-27 14:21:16	keveloper	So what you're going to SLI 2 1080Tis??
2017-06-27 14:21:17	keveloper	lol
2017-06-27 14:21:27	Rothlan	the 6 in the mining rig will be sold off when it's not worth it, I'll keep the 2 in the gaming machine :)
2017-06-27 14:21:37	keveloper	are 2 of them shared for gaming now?
2017-06-27 14:21:40	keveloper	or do you have another card
2017-06-27 14:22:10	Rothlan	yeah, when I game (which is rare right now) they can't mine obviously, but most of the time they just mine
2017-06-27 14:22:32	keveloper	How much was the initial investment?
2017-06-27 14:25:13	Rothlan	avg card around $750, $150 for MB and CPU and RAM and tiny SSD.  1 $150 PSU (2 total for me) for every 3 cards, $10 in wood for the rig, $50 for the PCIe risers
2017-06-27 14:26:08	Rothlan	so I guess about $6510
2017-06-27 14:26:24	Rothlan	3 months to break even
2017-06-27 14:26:28	Rothlan	(95 days)
2017-06-27 14:26:47	keveloper	That'll be nice once your even :D
2017-06-27 14:27:04	keveloper	I want to get into something like this, more invested in cryptocurrencies than i currently am
2017-06-27 14:27:12	keveloper	just kind of threw $400 at it and trade occasionally lol
2017-06-27 14:27:37	Rothlan	yeah, and I figure I can sell the cards for $350 each, and the CPU/MB/RAM/SSD for $75, and about $75 each PSU, so $3025 back there
2017-06-27 14:27:56	keveloper	This sounds like a great idea lol
2017-06-27 14:27:57	Rothlan	well, minus $700 cause I'll keep 2 cards
2017-06-27 14:28:02	keveloper	Like a too good to be true idea
2017-06-27 14:28:17	keveloper	Do you _really_ need 2 Ti's lol
2017-06-27 14:28:24	Rothlan	well the market could collapse any day so you never really know till you have the US cash in hand :)
2017-06-27 142017-08-07 09:11:57	Rothlan	so you been watching eth's price over the weekend?

2017-08-14 10:56:44	keveloper	Hmm ok
2017-08-14 10:56:47	keveloper	i'm still not even
2017-08-14 10:56:50	keveloper	:'(
2017-08-14 10:57:31	Rothlan	but you're up on ETH right?  so you're not losing any money since you bought ETH, you lost that money before, right?
2017-08-14 10:57:50	keveloper	yeah im up on eth
2017-08-14 10:57:59	keveloper	i sold
2017-08-14 10:58:15	Rothlan	can you believe bitcoin hit $4300?
2017-08-14 10:58:29	keveloper	i woulve doubled my investment if i didn't trade alts lol
2017-08-14 10:58:48	keveloper	NEOS?
2017-08-14 10:58:51	keveloper	what is that
2017-08-14 10:58:54	keveloper	Neoscoin?
2017-08-14 10:58:58	Rothlan	NEO is Chinese ETH
2017-08-14 10:59:04	Rothlan	used to be Antshares
2017-08-14 10:59:16	keveloper	Hmm..
2017-08-14 10:59:19	keveloper	I see NEOS but not NEO
2017-08-14 10:59:26	keveloper	Is it call neoscoin?
2017-08-14 10:59:32	Rothlan	OMG supposedly has some news coming out today from the creator of ETH and has been performing well recently
2017-08-14 10:59:35	keveloper	Price is .00064355 BTC right now?
2017-08-14 10:59:43	Rothlan	what exchange?  no, it's just called NEO
2017-08-14 10:59:49	keveloper	poloniex
2017-08-14 11:00:21	keveloper	bitcoin cash is showing +80023.95 right now and everything else is red
2017-08-14 11:00:22	Rothlan	ah, neither of them are on Polo, they're both on bittrex
2017-08-14 11:00:22	keveloper	hmm weird
2017-08-14 11:00:43	Rothlan	everything that is a BTC pair dropped because everyone is shifting to BTC as it skyrockets
2017-08-14 11:04:42	Rothlan	BTC will come back down to probably around $4000 when everyone takes profits from the price increase.  I hope so anyways, I need my alts to go back up :)
2017-08-14 11:05:27	keveloper	I'd have more than doubled my investment right now if I just kept BTC :( lol
2017-08-14 11:05:34	keveloper	fucking STR
2017-08-14 11:05:41	keveloper	stellar is the only reason i lost $200 lol
2017-08-14 11:05:54	keveloper	i was doing good until stellar crashed
2017-08-14 11:06:03	Rothlan	NEO had a higher market cap than LTC over the weekend, safe to say it's growing quick and strong.  really good long term investment too.  well, if you had bought NEO two weeks ago you would've increased your investment by 8x.
2017-08-14 11:06:15	keveloper	:o
2017-08-14 11:06:37	keveloper	maybe i'll get on bittrex
2017-08-14 11:07:00	Rothlan	I think OMG has more room to grow than NEO right now, but it's hard to tell
2017-08-14 11:07:45	Rothlan	anyways, everything is risky and don't invest with anything you're not willing to lose :)
2017-08-14 11:08:51	keveloper	Lol it was $400 4 months ago I've forgotten about it by now lol
2017-08-14 11:09:14	keveloper	Just would've been nice to have #500+ profit right now :P
2017-08-14 11:09:18	keveloper	$500*
2017-08-14 11:11:57	Rothlan	looks like it went up with everything back in May and has never recovered
2017-08-14 11:12:14	Rothlan	STR
2017-08-14 11:12:18	keveloper	Yeah

2017-08-14 11:12:54	keveloper	"we'll what if it goes up more" fuck you keveloper 
2017-08-14 11:12:55	Rothlan	yeah, that's the problem with fast rises, they don't build any support behind them and crash just as fast

2017-08-14 11:28:42	Rothlan	oh, but we might have issues with IOTA, that's right.  it's Bitfinex only and US people might lose access or something, never mind.
