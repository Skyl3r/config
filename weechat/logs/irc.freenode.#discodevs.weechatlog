2016-05-24 14:57:42	na_th_an	when you have a detached head you need to create a branch to work off of
2016-05-24 14:57:50	na_th_an	you have to pop a head out of the branch
2016-05-24 14:57:55	na_th_an	the branch being master
2016-05-24 14:58:02	na_th_an	pop a head out of master by branching

2016-05-24 14:59:06	na_th_an	git reset --HARD HEAD

2016-05-26 08:44:36	na_th_an	and I got a clean build
2016-05-26 08:44:48	na_th_an	but I can't bring myself to show anyone else the abominations I had to do to get such a thing
2016-05-26 08:44:48	frappi	nice

2016-05-26 09:15:23	frappi	na_th_an: you mean zhewen
2016-05-26 09:15:28	na_th_an	zhewan
2016-05-26 09:15:29	na_th_an	ye
2016-05-26 09:15:40	na_th_an	I think it's zhhewan
2016-05-26 09:15:53	frappi	zhewen
2016-05-26 09:16:31	frappi	abbyaha: can you mark a bunch of tickets as part of a sprint in trello
2016-05-26 09:16:32	frappi	or something like that
2016-05-26 09:16:43	abbyaha	yea
2016-05-26 09:16:49	abbyaha	i did it as a tag i think
2016-05-26 09:17:34	frappi	label?
2016-05-26 09:17:42	abbyaha	er yea, that
2016-05-26 09:17:48	frappi	basically an easy way to make a bunch of tickets due on the same day
2016-05-26 09:17:57	abbyaha	there are due dates
2016-05-26 09:18:21	frappi	yes i understand that but don't make me go through 16 tickets and mark the same date and time on all of the them
2016-05-26 09:18:41	abbyaha	idk maybe, i didnt get too deep into the features
2016-05-26 09:24:45	na_th_an	I'm 99% sure the tech leads are talking in their skype chat about Jeff Jacobs driving like an asshole to someone
2016-05-26 09:25:20	na_th_an	"Did he yell 'Be great today' as your car crashed into the ditch?"
2016-05-26 09:25:36	_saracen	LOL
2016-05-26 09:25:38	frappi	fuck ubiquity
2016-05-26 09:25:39	abbyaha	lolol
2016-05-26 09:26:07	frappi	there's this command you have to put in this deploy file
2016-05-26 09:26:17	frappi	and it copies a file from the installscripts into the deploy folder
2016-05-26 09:26:21	frappi	and you give it a destination
2016-05-26 09:26:31	frappi	if it is going to be in a folder that doesn't exist
2016-05-26 09:26:41	frappi	YOU HAVE TO CREATE THE FOLDER IN A SEPARATE COMMAND
2016-05-26 09:26:50	na_th_an	that's... pretty standard
2016-05-26 09:26:51	frappi	instead of the fucking copy command creating the directory you told it to be in
2016-05-26 09:27:02	frappi	na_th_an: you can create directories with mv
2016-05-26 09:27:02	na_th_an	probably because standard linux utilities don't do that
2016-05-26 09:27:14	frappi	doesn't mv create directories
2016-05-26 09:27:20	na_th_an	not by default
2016-05-26 09:27:23	na_th_an	there's probably maybe a switch
2016-05-26 09:27:28	frappi	ugh
2016-05-26 09:27:35	frappi	ur standard
2016-05-26 09:27:51	frappi	that would be fine if the command was like
2016-05-26 09:27:53	frappi	mkdir blah
2016-05-26 09:27:54	frappi	but its
2016-05-26 09:28:15	frappi	    - name: Create install directory for the webapp
2016-05-26 09:28:15	frappi	      file:
2016-05-26 09:28:15	frappi	        state=directory
2016-05-26 09:28:15	frappi	        path={{ installdir_cmd.path }}/tomcat/webapps/{{ war_name }}

2016-05-26 09:28:51	na_th_an	well, as a java programmer, I like verbosity

2016-05-26 13:31:49	na_th_an	no it isn't?
2016-05-26 13:32:00	frappi	it wasn't only an issue with proquest stuff
2016-05-26 13:32:07	frappi	and the fix had nothing to do with proquest stuff
2016-05-26 13:32:09	na_th_an	well yeah but that's how it was discovered
2016-05-26 13:32:11	frappi	proquest stuff was just how the bug was found
2016-05-26 13:32:12	frappi	yeah
2016-05-26 13:32:14	na_th_an	and what was fixed
2016-05-26 13:32:17	na_th_an	and the acceptance criterea
2016-05-26 13:32:31	frappi	the AC is more broad than proquest
2016-05-26 13:32:37	frappi	unless you are talking about the table thing
2016-05-26 13:32:48	frappi	the test data for that just happened to be proquest but you could have used other databases for it
2016-05-26 13:33:08	frappi	the same sort of issue happens with worldcat and worldcat dissertations

2016-05-26 13:37:21	na_th_an	even after it's deployed and stuff you're supposed to leave it open for like a week or so
2016-05-26 13:37:24	na_th_an	I mean it's not a big deal
2016-05-26 13:37:27	frappi	gersh jeez
2016-05-26 13:37:42	na_th_an	generally people go in friday afternoon or monday morning and close their old code reviews
2016-05-26 13:38:02	na_th_an	once people are finished code reviewing it stops appearing for them, so it doesn't hurt anything to keep old code reviews open
2016-05-26 13:38:12	na_th_an	the only people that are affected are the lazy ones who don't do their code reviews like they should
2016-05-26 13:38:33	na_th_an	I just cloesd a review that had been 'due' for like 13 days
2016-05-26 13:44:22	frappi	na_th_an: reopened just for youuuuuu

2016-05-26 13:59:13	na_th_an	yes
2016-05-26 14:12:04	_saracen	what did Rashmi say?
2016-05-26 14:14:01	na_th_an	she's been telling jeff that she wants to hire a rockstar developer(s)
2016-05-26 14:14:12	na_th_an	bc we all suck basically
2016-05-26 14:14:39	frappi	she says like "we need to get some rockstar developers in here to blah"
2016-05-26 14:14:45	frappi	first of all what the fuck is a rockstar developer
2016-05-26 14:15:43	_saracen	An egotistical pos
2016-05-26 14:19:23	na_th_an	I view a rockstar as someone who is willing to work 70+ hours a week for standard salary
2016-05-26 14:19:39	na_th_an	because that's what I see them described as by 'normal' programmers on reddit and SO
2016-05-26 14:19:57	frappi	where did rashmi come from
2016-05-26 14:20:02	na_th_an	rockstars have no family, no kids, are usually a young male
2016-05-26 14:20:05	na_th_an	frappi: DSW
2016-05-26 14:20:08	na_th_an	same place as Cathy
2016-05-26 14:20:09	frappi	like
2016-05-26 14:20:11	frappi	the shoe place
2016-05-26 14:20:14	na_th_an	ya
2016-05-26 14:20:20	frappi	what did she do there
2016-05-26 14:20:31	na_th_an	I think she ran a team that did stuff on the online store
2016-05-26 14:20:45	frappi	ah
2016-05-26 14:21:28	_saracen	So 'Rockstar' is the pet name that managers give their over-worked devs to make them feel special
2016-05-26 14:21:33	na_th_an	yes
2016-05-26 14:21:48	na_th_an	there are also 'ninjas'
2016-05-26 14:21:56	frappi	picture rashi me saying "we need to get some rockstar developerrsss"
2016-05-26 14:22:01	na_th_an	if you want to redo OWCCustomQueryFactory, we need a rockstar
2016-05-26 14:22:01	frappi	in her forever rising voice
2016-05-26 14:22:02	_saracen	And 'Artisans'
2016-05-26 14:22:06	frappi	makes me angry
2016-05-26 14:22:08	na_th_an	if we want to add a feature to OWCCustomQueryFactory, we need a ninja
2016-05-26 14:22:27	na_th_an	I expend effort trying not to dislike her :/
2016-05-26 14:22:35	na_th_an	I miss bill
2016-05-26 14:22:46	frappi	i mean he's like right behind you
2016-05-26 14:22:47	_saracen	Ninja's > Rockstars?
2016-05-26 14:23:48	frappi	how do you see who opened a service now
2016-05-26 14:24:08	na_th_an	the answer to"how do you _______________ a service now" is 'idk'
2016-05-26 14:25:03	frappi	unix group is like 3 pods down from middleware right
2016-05-26 14:25:06	frappi	idk if i wanna go down there
2016-05-26 14:25:25	na_th_an	not totally sure
2016-05-26 14:25:27	na_th_an	but I think
2016-05-26 14:25:39	frappi	i just wanna be like "hey do you guys have everything you need, is the ticket clear, have you started, do you know when youll be done" lol
2016-05-26 14:25:46	frappi	i mean it might even just be a host restart

2016-05-26 14:36:23	frappi	phone
2016-05-26 14:36:38	na_th_an	OnePlus is a line of budget phones
2016-05-26 14:36:40	na_th_an	that are pretty good
2016-05-26 14:36:47	na_th_an	but relatively unknown outside of android enthusiasts
2016-05-26 14:37:00	na_th_an	I think they're more popular overseas, but basically unheard of in the US
2016-05-26 14:37:08	na_th_an	they just announced the OnePlusThree
2016-05-26 14:37:19	frappi	is it pure android
2016-05-26 14:37:27	na_th_an	that's the first time I've heard anyone mention OnePlus outside of /r/android
2016-05-26 14:37:45	_saracen	Did they show off project Aria earlier this week
2016-05-26 14:37:49	na_th_an	they run Cyanogen OS
2016-05-26 14:37:54	frappi	oh sweet
2016-05-26 14:37:58	na_th_an	which is the commercial version of CyanogenMod
2016-05-26 14:37:58	frappi	is it good
2016-05-26 14:38:09	frappi	OxygenOs though
2016-05-26 14:38:12	na_th_an	idk much about it, but I'm pretty sure it's easy to hack and put vanilla android on it
2016-05-26 14:38:26	frappi	i am so curious about this
2016-05-26 14:38:37	na_th_an	they're mostly in india I think
2016-05-26 14:38:38	frappi	this thing looks gorgeous

2016-05-26 14:44:08	na_th_an	not to the enumeration class

2016-05-31 09:54:07	_saracen	na_th_an: Oh, she isn't new-new
2016-05-31 09:54:21	_saracen	She has been on the EUI team for as long as it has existed
2016-05-31 09:54:21	frappi	new-new
2016-05-31 09:54:32	_saracen	exactly
2016-05-31 09:54:45	na_th_an	oh

2016-05-31 09:55:21	_saracen	Honestly, I'm not sure what she will do. Leo basically worked on EUI stuff next to me
2016-05-31 09:55:43	_saracen	We're ahead of the EUI team and we got react stuff working faster than they did with Silas' help
2016-05-31 09:55:56	_saracen	So we're basically just waiting for them to produce all the 'widgets' and styles that we'll be using
2016-05-31 09:56:25	na_th_an	THE PARAMETER MAP ISN'T NULL \o/
2016-05-31 09:56:29	na_th_an	idk how to put values in it

2016-05-31 10:01:04	na_th_an	all day
2016-05-31 10:02:35	frappi	i might remove the webapp completely and install
2016-05-31 10:02:41	frappi	make sure nothing is left over
2016-05-31 10:02:48	na_th_an	why not
2016-05-31 10:06:37	_saracen	frappi: like blue background?
2016-05-31 10:06:56	na_th_an	solarized is best
2016-05-31 10:07:02	na_th_an	I like it a lot
2016-05-31 10:09:43	frappi	_saracen: yeah
2016-05-31 10:10:00	_saracen	Some of the devs here have their terminal set up to randomly choose a theme
2016-05-31 10:10:05	_saracen	For each tab
2016-05-31 10:10:11	abbyaha	ew
2016-05-31 10:10:13	abbyaha	why

2016-05-31 10:11:07	abbyaha	ugh...that makes sense
2016-05-31 10:17:52	frappi	Rothlan: can you text from computer with hangouts using fi

2016-05-31 10:19:40	frappi	and those reddit gifs
2016-05-31 10:19:53	frappi	I might get Fi and then use less data
2016-05-31 10:20:00	Rothlan	I browse reddit at all the stop lights
2016-05-31 10:20:05	abbyaha	lol

2016-06-01 09:42:59	abbyaha	lol
2016-06-01 09:43:33	Rothlan	yeah, there's a no-touch css modifier but that means on devices with touch and mouse you won't get the mouse over effect
2016-06-01 09:44:07	Rothlan	and then there's a javascript fix where you remove the element and then readd it

2016-06-03 11:37:25	na_th_an	frappuccino: you can right click and copy it
2016-06-03 11:37:29	frappuccino	modals in materialize is easy

2016-06-03 11:37:47	frappuccino	ehhh, like you are right but thats not intuitive

2016-06-03 11:55:22	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-03 11:55:49	_saracen	It seems like they are just throwing everything onto a queue and processing them slowly. I thought it was fucked up at first and put in a second order and the first cleared adn the second just failed because the domains were taken

2016-06-03 13:54:56	na_th_an	and so now its the dev's problem instead of the people who manage the project
2016-06-03 13:55:55	Rothlan	and it's starting to be "why didn't you say you were having trouble earlier so we could allocate more resources to you"
2016-06-03 13:56:15	abbyaha	sorry Rothlan :(

2016-06-03 13:59:22	_saracen	Because that was so necessary
2016-06-03 13:59:42	na_th_an	yes, all gherkin must be automatedh
2016-06-03 14:03:06	_saracen	At one point Rothlan was writing some JS plugin to link gherkins to JS tests
2016-06-03 14:03:59	Rothlan	yeah, it's ugly and terrible and makes me sad.  everything is so clunky.  I literally spent 3 hours writing code and 9 hours writing tests for one ticket.

2016-06-03 14:21:51	_saracen	Library of Congress?
2016-06-03 14:22:01	na_th_an	and at some point you'd think they'd sit back and think "you know, this sucks."
2016-06-03 14:22:09	_saracen	Or no, that was SRU?
2016-06-03 14:22:20	na_th_an	SRU was library of congress I think
2016-06-03 14:22:25	na_th_an	idk who made RDF
2016-06-03 14:22:44	Rothlan	W3C
2016-06-03 14:23:00	frappuccino	Rothlan: yeah
2016-06-03 14:25:01	frappuccino	jeff descirbed it as pretty cool but OCLC isn't using it right
2016-06-03 14:26:16	frappuccino	my chair is so cold

2016-06-03 14:27:10	na_th_an	yo
2016-06-03 14:27:21	na_th_an	the idea of RDF seems okay
2016-06-03 14:27:23	na_th_an	the syntax is trash
2016-06-03 14:29:14	na_th_an	whoooo 0 codenarc violations in the project
2016-06-03 14:29:39	frappuccino	+1 on zachs thing

2016-06-03 14:30:00	na_th_an	are we using the stupid one?
2016-06-03 14:30:07	frappuccino	is it turle
2016-06-03 14:30:09	frappuccino	turtle*
2016-06-03 14:30:13	frappuccino	i think you are using turtle
2016-06-03 14:30:14	_saracen	Turtle is what we use
2016-06-03 14:30:32	_saracen	Turtle is nicer looking that most of the others

2016-06-03 14:30:46	frappuccino	I think N-Triples is easy to read except its super redundant
2016-06-03 14:31:12	frappuccino	JSON-LD is cool
2016-06-03 14:31:18	frappuccino	RDF XML sucks
2016-06-03 14:31:36	frappuccino	N3 is kinda like turtle
2016-06-03 14:31:55	frappuccino	jeff needs a white board

2016-06-03 16:07:30	abbyaha	i feel like when brett was talking about the team being nice and manageable this week it was because a certain manager was absent
2016-06-03 16:07:42	frappi	something is wrong with my desk lol it is making noise
2016-06-03 16:07:47	na_th_an	omg
2016-06-03 16:07:54	na_th_an	when bill was talking about stress levels
2016-06-03 16:07:57	na_th_an	I wanted to be like
2016-06-03 16:08:05	na_th_an	"Yeah I've felt really good since Rashmi went on vacation"
2016-06-03 16:08:14	na_th_an	"I think they're going to spike back up pretty quick next week"
2016-06-03 16:08:20	frappi	ahh there we go
2016-06-03 16:08:27	abbyaha	you probably could say something to him in private
2016-06-03 16:08:39	na_th_an	I could
2016-06-03 16:08:58	frappi	just go loudly tell him right now
2016-06-03 16:09:09	abbyaha	it would def be his place to talk to her, or tell greg who can talk to her
2016-06-03 16:09:14	na_th_an	I should maybe forward him an email behind other people's back
2016-06-03 16:09:19	na_th_an	we'll see how it goes
2016-06-03 16:09:22	abbyaha	yea def do that
2016-06-03 16:09:25	frappi	lolol
2016-06-03 16:09:32	abbyaha	"rashmi said i wasnt a rockstar"
2016-06-03 16:09:37	na_th_an	I personally don't interact with her a lot so it's hard to say what should change
2016-06-03 16:09:41	frappi	this chair is like super squeaky
2016-06-03 16:09:51	na_th_an	besides making jeff not have to give shitty estimates and impossible stuff
2016-06-03 16:10:01	frappi	can i request a new chair
2016-06-03 16:10:03	frappi	this chair sucks
2016-06-03 16:10:11	na_th_an	because when my project's tech lead is stressed, busy, overworked, and working 50+ hours a week
2016-06-03 16:10:16	na_th_an	guess what, it affects me too
2016-06-03 16:10:53	na_th_an	idk what a "work break-down schedule" is
2016-06-03 16:10:56	na_th_an	but
2016-06-03 16:10:58	na_th_an	ugh
2016-06-03 16:11:54	na_th_an	jeff is talking about smoking dope during design meetings
2016-06-03 16:11:57	na_th_an	I'm down

2016-06-03 16:14:14	abbyaha	yea lol
2016-06-03 16:14:47	abbyaha	what were they saying
2016-06-03 16:14:51	na_th_an	idk
2016-06-03 16:14:54	na_th_an	nothing about you
2016-06-03 16:20:31	_saracen	What did Mela do now?
2016-06-03 16:20:34	na_th_an	so
2016-06-03 16:20:35	frappi	lol
2016-06-03 16:20:44	na_th_an	you know how there's no performance team
2016-06-03 16:20:47	na_th_an	and no performance team meeting?
2016-06-03 16:20:54	_saracen	Yes
2016-06-03 16:20:54	na_th_an	and our triage process sucks?
2016-06-03 16:20:57	_saracen	Yes
2016-06-03 16:21:05	na_th_an	and we've found issues in the process, that weren't fixed, then became production issues
2016-06-03 16:21:18	na_th_an	so there's no point in proactively finding the performance issues if we don't address them until they blow up
2016-06-03 16:21:28	na_th_an	this has been stated in a couple emails
2016-06-03 16:21:42	_saracen	I sit next to Mike, who is probably writing those emails
2016-06-03 16:21:46	na_th_an	and Mela forwarded one to Cathy essentially saying "they're not going to monitor performance anymore"
2016-06-03 16:21:56	na_th_an	no, they were team internal emails
2016-06-03 16:21:56	_saracen	:/
2016-06-03 16:22:06	na_th_an	and Mela went and forwarded one on the side to Cathy
2016-06-03 16:22:09	_saracen	Oh, gotcha. Mike has been saying that for months
2016-06-03 16:22:32	_saracen	Because he was Performance lead and it felt like we were wasting time doing all this shit without any chance to make it better
2016-06-03 16:22:46	_saracen	What a tattle-y thing to do :(
2016-06-03 16:23:19	na_th_an	yeah

2016-06-07 15:48:43	_saracen	I think it is supposed to take domain objects, like courses, and Jena-fy them so that they can be sent to firefly
2016-06-07 15:49:24	Rothlan	ha, I think you did _saracen

2016-06-08 09:50:05	frappi	and they replied
2016-06-08 09:50:07	frappi	Hi Kevin,
2016-06-08 09:50:07	frappi	I’m not sure why Sue thinks this is something payroll sets up. It is set up by HR Recruiting, or Lori Koch.  Lori got your vacation and sick started, but I agree, you should have 4 Personal days.  I’ve contacted Lori Koch again.
2016-06-08 09:50:13	frappi	lol
2016-06-08 09:52:03	_saracen	Lori Koch is the benefits lady. Not sure why sue wouldn't send you to her first
2016-06-08 09:52:24	_saracen	Unless she thought you were trying to get paid for wrongly-applied vacation or something
2016-06-08 09:53:25	frappi	dude idk
2016-06-08 09:53:37	frappi	definitely not, it was a very straight forward email lol
2016-06-08 09:54:03	frappi	I have been a salaried employee (part-time) since April 12th, and full-time since May 9th. I was told I would get 4 personal days upon going full-time, and would start accumulating sick time and vacation time. Workday is showing that I have 0 for all of the three. Is this right?
2016-06-08 09:54:05	frappi	thats what i said
2016-06-08 09:54:36	abbyaha	lol frappi
2016-06-08 09:54:43	abbyaha	they dont want you to have any personal days
2016-06-08 09:55:19	na_th_an	HR should have incidents and meetings when they fuck up too

2016-06-08 10:28:30	na_th_an	ya
2016-06-08 10:28:35	na_th_an	I'm looking at it
2016-06-08 10:28:39	_saracen	That stuff is pure magic
2016-06-08 10:28:41	frappi	the repositroy thing is spring data
2016-06-08 10:28:47	frappi	its so cool
2016-06-08 10:28:51	frappi	the CrudRepository thing
2016-06-08 10:28:54	_saracen	wtf
2016-06-08 10:28:56	frappi	it blew my mind when i wrote it
2016-06-08 10:29:27	frappi	that interface is not implemented anywhere, its all spring magicx
2016-06-08 10:29:44	na_th_an	I wonder if OSU is going to move their web apps class to Spring Boot instead of Ruby on Rails sometime
2016-06-08 10:29:53	na_th_an	it would make a lot of sense
2016-06-08 10:31:30	frappi	thymeleaf was cool to use too
2016-06-08 10:31:43	na_th_an	from now on I'm going to assume Eric does 'something' for an hour before he gets on irc
2016-06-08 10:31:43	frappi	like
2016-06-08 10:31:44	frappi	<img id="loadedCanvas" th:width="${imageWidth}" th:height="${imageHeight}" th:src="${imageDataURL}" hidden="hidden"/>
2016-06-08 10:31:55	na_th_an	I looked into tythmeleaf and didn't really see what I liked
2016-06-08 10:31:55	frappi	lol
2016-06-08 10:31:59	na_th_an	but I didn't use it much
2016-06-08 10:32:15	frappi	i liked it for what i used it for
2016-06-08 10:32:17	na_th_an	I really like the idea of having a totally separate backend from the view
2016-06-08 10:32:27	frappi	i like the functionality a lot that i pasted
2016-06-08 10:32:30	na_th_an	I've always hated how some controllers would return views
2016-06-08 10:32:36	na_th_an	and others just did stuff and returned ajax
2016-06-08 10:32:59	frappi	lol are you looking at my controllers
2016-06-08 10:33:04	na_th_an	no
2016-06-08 10:33:12	frappi	mine all return views :P
2016-06-08 10:33:12	_saracen	I know people can't help it, but I get itensely mad for a moment when someone has a really loud, violent sneeze.
2016-06-08 10:33:19	frappi	wait one might return ajax with an id
2016-06-08 10:33:24	na_th_an	_saracen: I have loud sneezes

2016-06-08 11:32:58	na_th_an	wait
2016-06-08 11:33:00	frappi	nope
2016-06-08 11:33:06	abbyaha	its fucking loud here today
2016-06-08 11:33:21	frappi	no idea what that appdata thing is
2016-06-08 11:33:23	na_th_an	yeah it's loud as fuck
2016-06-08 11:36:12	frappi	tbh i kinda knew that would have to happen then i forgot
2016-06-08 11:36:20	na_th_an	lol
2016-06-08 11:36:44	frappi	what chmod code do you want
2016-06-08 11:36:47	na_th_an	um
2016-06-08 11:37:07	na_th_an	I'm guessing this runs as fna_ci
2016-06-08 11:37:14	na_th_an	so 755 should be fine
2016-06-08 11:37:15	frappi	i think
2016-06-08 11:37:15	frappi	okay
2016-06-08 11:37:20	abbyaha	want to get lunch at 11:45? im bored
2016-06-08 11:37:22	na_th_an	or whatever you normally use
2016-06-08 11:37:27	na_th_an	7 is the important part
2016-06-08 11:37:30	frappi	if i chmod on the dir will that make everything under it inherit
2016-06-08 11:37:34	na_th_an	no
2016-06-08 11:37:36	frappi	k
2016-06-08 11:37:42	na_th_an	chmod on directories is weird
2016-06-08 11:37:49	na_th_an	because +x in directiories means you can go into them
2016-06-08 11:37:57	frappi	wait
2016-06-08 11:38:01	frappi	im confused becuase the admin tool works
2016-06-08 11:38:03	na_th_an	but you can not have x in a directory but still read /write to the files in it
2016-06-08 11:38:10	na_th_an	it probably calls "sh"
2016-06-08 11:38:14	na_th_an	this is just trynig to execute the script
2016-06-08 11:38:21	na_th_an	if I call sh adminTool.sh it'd work
2016-06-08 11:38:21	frappi	okay
2016-06-08 11:38:28	frappi	doesn't the script just start the admin tool
2016-06-08 11:38:35	na_th_an	idk
2016-06-08 11:38:40	na_th_an	idk what any of this is
2016-06-08 11:38:48	na_th_an	I just know what the error message means
2016-06-08 11:41:35	abbyaha	lets invite jay to eat with us

2016-06-08 12:30:41	_saracen	You were going to sit in the basement anyway
2016-06-08 12:30:49	_saracen	My idea saved you from that
2016-06-08 12:30:57	na_th_an	there is no difference between basement and conference room
2016-06-08 12:31:01	na_th_an	both are windowless

2016-06-08 12:31:06	frappi	unless i wanna play minecraft
2016-06-08 12:31:10	_saracen	But it is the literal basement

2016-06-08 12:34:39	na_th_an	Due to a wide-spread corruption of the German Authority data in Perf, the entire Perf Authority database will be cloned from Production on Wednesday.  If you would be affected by the absence of the Authority database in Perf and need to have this postponed, please notify me by Wed noon. Otherwise, we will proceed with the refresh and send a message when it’s complete.

2016-06-08 15:33:06	beefnprokboi	...
2016-06-08 15:33:12	beefnprokboi	the point is to clean up logs

2016-06-09 10:12:05	na_th_an	then I listened to jeff and product talk about what stats cathy might possibly want for 20 minutes
2016-06-09 10:12:08	Rothlan_	how do you like the Vive?

2016-06-09 10:12:47	na_th_an	and I asked all of my friends about it after they tried it
2016-06-09 10:12:53	na_th_an	and they asked what I was talking about
2016-06-09 10:12:57	Rothlan_	nice
2016-06-09 10:13:03	na_th_an	so I explained it and they said "no not at all"
2016-06-09 10:13:04	_saracen	na_th_an: Cathy still doesn't know what stats are useful?
2016-06-09 10:13:16	na_th_an	_saracen: what stats she wants on an SRI related dashboard
2016-06-09 10:13:30	_saracen	na_th_an: oh okay
2016-06-09 10:14:19	Rothlan_	do you find being able to move around the room adds a lot?
2016-06-09 10:14:41	na_th_an	yes
2016-06-09 10:14:50	na_th_an	I moved my room around so I can do room scale
2016-06-09 10:14:56	na_th_an	it's incredible
2016-06-09 10:15:03	na_th_an	the tracking is great
2016-06-09 10:15:06	frappi	jeffs all flustered and busy
2016-06-09 10:15:10	frappi	i need to ask him a question lol
2016-06-09 10:15:17	na_th_an	it was easy to set up (besides having to go buy a drill bit set and losing a drywall anchor in the wall)
2016-06-09 10:15:17	frappi	im afraid
2016-06-09 10:15:22	Rothlan_	yeah, I can't understand why anyone would get an Oculus for multiple reasons, but room scale seems like it would add so much
2016-06-09 10:15:25	na_th_an	what's your question
2016-06-09 10:15:32	na_th_an	the controllers and room scale complete it
2016-06-09 10:15:36	na_th_an	without it it'd be cool
2016-06-09 10:15:39	na_th_an	but this is fucking mind blowing
2016-06-09 10:15:44	na_th_an	painting in 3d is incredible

2016-06-09 10:17:19	Rothlan_	yeah, they call it tron view, it's more so you can find your keyboard or drink or something

2016-06-09 13:29:07	na_th_an	good

2016-06-13 13:59:20	na_th_an	and they can see on days when there are global I/Os that suddenly people are more unhappy

2016-06-13 14:23:34	_saracen	na_th_an: frappuccino knows
2016-06-13 14:23:45	_saracen	He just wants us to tell him it's okay to go cowboy on his project
2016-06-13 14:23:52	na_th_an	don't do a side project == the most bf4
2016-06-13 14:23:57	frappuccino	OH SHIT
2016-06-13 14:23:59	_saracen	Truth
2016-06-13 14:24:07	frappuccino	no job == the most bf4
2016-06-13 14:24:08	frappuccino	mostest
2016-06-13 14:24:13	_saracen	For a while
2016-06-13 14:24:18	na_th_an	no electricity == no bf4 tho
2016-06-13 14:24:19	_saracen	And then == the no more bf4
2016-06-13 14:24:25	abbyaha	what is bf4

2016-06-13 14:25:09	na_th_an	frappuccino: yes
2016-06-13 14:25:22	_saracen	fucking 3d printer needs to ship
2016-06-13 14:25:28	frappuccino	battlefield 3 was better though
2016-06-13 14:25:29	frappuccino	jeez
2016-06-13 14:25:29	abbyaha	soon!
2016-06-13 14:25:35	frappuccino	it was so fucking good :(
2016-06-13 14:25:36	na_th_an	when does it ship?
2016-06-13 14:25:40	_saracen	Not sure
2016-06-13 14:25:44	_saracen	Within the next week
2016-06-13 14:26:01	na_th_an	can I pay you to print things for me
2016-06-13 14:26:03	_saracen	The demand was crazy right after they announced it, so we are all in a big backorder queue
2016-06-13 14:26:17	_saracen	Depending on what it is
2016-06-13 14:26:41	_saracen	Probably only make you pay for the big things
2016-06-13 14:26:50	frappuccino	_saracen: a figurine of watto from episode 1
2016-06-13 14:26:55	na_th_an	I'd at least want to reimburse cost of filiment
2016-06-13 14:27:15	na_th_an	I think I mostly want one of those steam controller backs with a usb holder
2016-06-13 14:27:28	na_th_an	and maybe charging stands for vive controllers
2016-06-13 14:27:30	_saracen	Something that small would be tens of cents
2016-06-13 14:27:39	_saracen	There is a VR accessory category on thingiverse
2016-06-13 14:27:56	frappuccino	_saracen: were you answering me or na_th_an 
2016-06-13 14:27:56	_saracen	frappuccino: If you find a model
2016-06-13 14:27:59	na_th_an	if it's tens of cents I'll pay you $2 for teh more printings of things
2016-06-13 14:28:00	frappuccino	_saracen: lol
2016-06-13 14:28:06	_saracen	I mean, yes?
2016-06-13 14:28:26	frappuccino	_saracen: what will you not let us print
2016-06-13 14:28:30	_saracen	I'll have to see what material people say is best for the steam thing
2016-06-13 14:28:35	_saracen	steam controller backs
2016-06-13 14:28:53	frappuccino	na_th_an: uh oh
2016-06-13 14:29:02	frappuccino	_saracen: can i print out a tv
2016-06-13 14:29:07	frappuccino	60 inch
2016-06-13 14:29:12	abbyaha	can i print a car
2016-06-13 14:29:13	_saracen	Not with my printer
2016-06-13 14:29:17	_saracen	abbyaha: A tiny one
2016-06-13 14:29:23	abbyaha	deal
2016-06-13 14:29:23	frappuccino	i would like to print a boat
2016-06-13 14:29:28	frappuccino	a yacht
2016-06-13 14:29:31	frappuccino	55 foot yacht
2016-06-13 14:29:32	_saracen	Everyone prints boats
2016-06-13 14:29:35	abbyaha	can i print a piece of paper

2016-06-13 14:30:14	frappuccino	_saracen: can i print a bobblehead of the mouth of sauron
2016-06-13 14:30:22	abbyaha	lol
2016-06-13 14:30:29	abbyaha	that would be cool
2016-06-13 14:30:39	_saracen	That'd probably be a bit 'more' expensive, but yeah
2016-06-13 14:30:54	frappuccino	_saracen: what about a 3 foot sized sand person
2016-06-13 14:31:12	frappuccino	to scare off jawas from my apartment
2016-06-13 14:31:24	_saracen	My print volume is like 9.3" x 9.8" x 10"
2016-06-13 14:31:34	_saracen	So. Use that to temper any additional 'can i print...' questions
2016-06-13 14:31:49	frappuccino	what if i split into pieces
2016-06-13 14:31:54	frappuccino	and connect them
2016-06-13 14:31:54	abbyaha	^^^
2016-06-13 14:31:55	_saracen	People do that
2016-06-13 14:32:01	Rothlan	can you print a warcraft character?
2016-06-13 14:32:02	na_th_an	I would like a 9.3x9.8x10 cube
2016-06-13 14:32:06	_saracen	If it was really that tall it would be pretty damn expensive
2016-06-13 14:32:09	na_th_an	and a 9.3" sphere
2016-06-13 14:32:11	frappuccino	_saracen: can i print out a Rothlan figurine
2016-06-13 14:32:15	_saracen	lol
2016-06-13 14:32:19	_saracen	If it exists
2016-06-13 14:32:25	Rothlan	hehe, Rothlan is actually my Warcraft paladin's name :)
2016-06-13 14:32:29	frappuccino	na_th_an: lol
2016-06-13 14:32:29	abbyaha	he can make one
2016-06-13 14:32:35	na_th_an	baby deer?
2016-06-13 14:32:38	na_th_an	is that the commotion?
2016-06-13 14:32:39	_saracen	Is it sitting down
2016-06-13 14:32:44	_saracen	A deer
2016-06-13 14:32:48	frappuccino	_saracen: i want a figurine of Rothlan with his dogs sitting on top of his head
2016-06-13 14:32:50	frappuccino	on top of eachother
2016-06-13 14:32:58	Rothlan	lol
2016-06-13 14:32:59	abbyaha	im going to look
2016-06-13 14:33:01	_saracen	You get a good 3dscan
2016-06-13 14:33:11	_saracen	And pay me for the filiment
2016-06-13 14:33:12	na_th_an	I want to 3D print a 'base' so peolpe can come touch it
2016-06-13 14:33:21	na_th_an	and a gearbox
2016-06-13 14:33:24	na_th_an	so I can change gears
2016-06-13 14:33:33	_saracen	I'm surprised no one wants a set of printed parts for a 3d printer
2016-06-13 14:33:39	na_th_an	lol
2016-06-13 14:33:52	na_th_an	I'd rather you just print cash
2016-06-13 14:33:53	_saracen	First thing I am going to print after benchmarking is a set of repair parts for my printer
2016-06-13 14:34:14	_saracen	After you get those it is just a few motors, some belts and some linear rails
2016-06-13 14:34:25	_saracen	and the electronics / hotend extruder
2016-06-13 14:34:50	Rothlan	cool, WoW has a 3d model viewer that can export an .obj file
2016-06-13 14:35:04	na_th_an	printing a 3D printer with a 3D printer is basically the dream
2016-06-13 14:35:10	na_th_an	especially if you could print a better 3D printer
2016-06-13 14:35:25	na_th_an	they send you a bootstrap printer and you progressively print better parts
2016-06-13 14:35:40	Rothlan	can't do the electronics though
2016-06-13 14:36:24	na_th_an	yeah but the bootstrap printer would contain the needed electronics and motors
2016-06-13 14:36:42	_saracen	I mean, that is what most people do these days
2016-06-13 14:36:59	na_th_an	'most people' as if more than 10 people have a 3D printer
2016-06-13 14:37:10	_saracen	Get a crappy printer, print an active cooling shroud and put a second fan to get better prints
2016-06-13 14:37:17	na_th_an	lol
2016-06-13 14:37:30	_saracen	Print better parts so the printer makes better prints
2016-06-13 14:37:35	abbyaha	uhhhh i want parts
2016-06-13 14:37:41	na_th_an	I'll trade you vive time for parts
2016-06-13 14:37:56	_saracen	Dealz, yo
2016-06-13 14:38:12	_saracen	Keep an eye out for cheap / thrown out office printers
2016-06-13 14:38:24	_saracen	They usually have nice stepper motors and rails
2016-06-13 14:41:57	na_th_an	so do people just pull rails/motors out of normal printers, print some parts, and then have a 3D printer?
2016-06-13 14:42:06	frappuccino	na_th_an: wanna caf
2016-06-13 14:42:21	_saracen	You have to buy the hotend and extruder usually, but yeah
2016-06-13 14:42:40	na_th_an	neat
2016-06-13 14:42:42	_saracen	3d printers are basically regular printers with one more axis and a hotend that melts plastic
2016-06-13 14:43:11	_saracen	There is a huge movement called RepRap. Tons of open source designs that are meant to be self replicating
2016-06-13 14:43:28	_saracen	http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap_Machines

2016-06-13 14:43:57	_saracen	I think they have a 'Print it Forward' or whatever movement
2016-06-13 14:44:12	_saracen	Where you can find someone nearby that will print the parts for the frame
2016-06-13 14:44:22	frappuccino	youre taking too long to type stand up if youre coming

2016-06-13 14:46:46	na_th_an	yes

2016-06-13 15:19:33	frappuccino	hm
2016-06-13 15:19:58	frappuccino	A case has been opened with Workday and they are working to resolve the issue. Our hands are tied until they can resolve it.
2016-06-13 15:20:00	frappuccino	huh
2016-06-13 15:20:17	na_th_an	we pay $$$ for workdy
2016-06-13 15:20:21	na_th_an	they can't figure it out
2016-06-13 15:20:32	na_th_an	so they yelled at the workday people to do it
2016-06-13 15:20:45	na_th_an	but hey, they opened a CASE
2016-06-13 15:20:47	na_th_an	not just a ticket
2016-06-13 15:20:50	na_th_an	it's a case

2016-06-13 15:23:48	frappuccino	...
2016-06-13 15:23:59	na_th_an	there's a problem when your stakeholders, product people, and tech leads are so busy that you have devs who can't get the resources they need to produce quality work
2016-06-13 15:24:17	frappuccino	this is what the third place is for
2016-06-13 15:24:24	na_th_an	to make people less busy?
2016-06-13 15:24:28	frappuccino	no
2016-06-13 15:24:36	frappuccino	to go to when im sick of sitting here and not doing shit
2016-06-13 15:25:29	na_th_an	I thought that's what the bathroom was for
2016-06-13 15:26:56	frappuccino	nnnnnope
2016-06-13 15:28:06	frappuccino	spinning in my chair on my knees is great
2016-06-13 15:28:27	na_th_an	I thought you meant on your knees like
2016-06-13 15:28:31	na_th_an	your knees were on the ground
2016-06-13 15:28:34	abbyaha	lol
2016-06-13 15:28:35	na_th_an	and your stomach was on the chair
2016-06-13 15:28:42	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-13 15:28:46	frappuccino	you are right
2016-06-13 15:29:46	na_th_an	so glad kibana gives me 10 character input fields to write out things like parsed_message.eventData.institutionRegistryId
2016-06-13 15:30:16	frappuccino	why has the japanese house not made music in 7 months wtf

2016-06-14 09:34:57	Rothlan	where are people going for E3 news?
2016-06-14 09:36:22	Rothlan	XBox One Scorpio will do 4k/60 fps?  I'll believe it when I see it
2016-06-14 09:38:43	na_th_an	just like the xbox one can do 1080p 60fps I'm sure
2016-06-14 09:39:09	na_th_an	there were a LOT of reddit comments that were like "lol redditors are so dumb, I believe Microsoft's engineers more than random redditors"
2016-06-14 09:39:18	na_th_an	"Yeah I believe random people on the street more than redditors"
2016-06-14 09:39:35	na_th_an	I also believe everything marketers say
2016-06-14 09:39:49	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-14 09:39:50	Rothlan	yeah, the 1080 could do 4k/60fps if you turn down a couple of settings, that's $600
2016-06-14 09:40:16	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-14 09:40:20	Rothlan	so I guess if you mean static shadow, min particle effects and no AA 4k/60fps maybe
2016-06-14 09:40:35	na_th_an	the only way I can see it happening is if they do the same kind of optimizations they're planning on doing for VR in 4k
2016-06-14 09:40:41	Rothlan	yeah
2016-06-14 09:40:49	na_th_an	I can't imagine it'll be good except for the fact that "omg it's 4k"
2016-06-14 09:40:57	na_th_an	or it'll have an upscaler and they'll say it counts
2016-06-14 09:41:12	Rothlan	Oculus is buying exclusives with every game they can :(
2016-06-14 09:41:18	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-14 09:41:19	Rothlan	hate them so much
2016-06-14 09:41:24	na_th_an	at least they're timed exclusives
2016-06-14 09:41:29	na_th_an	but I don't want to support any devs that do that
2016-06-14 09:41:49	Rothlan	I wonder how much money Serious Sam's devs turned down

2016-06-14 10:20:31	abbyaha	he was like "i have literally no idea what shes talking about"

2016-06-15 09:18:36	na_th_an	scorpio next year
2016-06-15 09:18:45	na_th_an	scorpio will probably be able to do some kind of vr
2016-06-15 09:18:54	na_th_an	no vr has been announced yet
2016-06-15 09:18:58	na_th_an	but it's likely
2016-06-15 09:19:14	na_th_an	MS and Oculus seem like they'd be a good fit
2016-06-15 09:19:27	na_th_an	get Trump to build them a wall
2016-06-15 09:19:43	_saracen	They has Hololense right?
2016-06-15 09:20:04	_saracen	That isn't exactly VR, but I thought that was Microsoft's attempt at getting in on this headsetty action
2016-06-15 09:20:07	na_th_an	they do have the hololense but idk what's going on with that
2016-06-15 09:20:14	na_th_an	there really hasn't been much news about it

2016-06-15 09:27:29	na_th_an	I'm guessing ip spoofing only works from an oclc ip
2016-06-15 09:27:45	frappuccino	thats a dangerous assumption
2016-06-15 09:43:58	frappuccino	na_th_an: rashmi is just trying so ahrd

2016-06-15 10:03:35	na_th_an	JB was talking about how devs are so far removed from production that they feel like they have no control at all over it
2016-06-15 10:03:43	na_th_an	so they end up not really caring about what happens in production
2016-06-15 10:03:48	na_th_an	and that is definitely me

2016-06-15 10:06:04	frappi	i guess so
2016-06-15 10:06:09	_saracen	We just parse the string out with spring and use that to get info from the Institution Service
2016-06-15 10:06:17	_saracen	Someone could just shove that string into SQL like a dumbass

2016-06-15 10:24:58	na_th_an	do we have a plan
2016-06-15 10:25:00	frappi	na_th_an: it looks like these databases arent remote on 21274 and still return no results os
2016-06-15 10:25:01	frappi	so*
2016-06-15 10:25:04	frappi	maybe they just have no results
2016-06-15 10:25:13	_saracen	Plan?

2016-06-15 10:28:32	_saracen	Well, we had planned on doing stuff more along the lines of code challenges
2016-06-15 10:28:44	_saracen	But if you guys want to do that and think you can make progress, go for it
2016-06-15 10:30:23	na_th_an	I was just wondering if we had the challenges set that we were gonna do
2016-06-15 10:42:13	frappi	i was joking i can do that on my own time lol
2016-06-15 10:42:15	_saracen	No. I've once again been too busy / tired to do much work on it
2016-06-15 10:42:26	_saracen	I might take some time today to get it all set
2016-06-15 10:43:18	_saracen	I'm going to send out an email today and say that today it is happening but it won't be one of the 'official' meetings because I don't have OCLC food support yet lol
2016-06-15 10:45:57	na_th_an	lol ok
2016-06-15 10:46:45	_saracen	I emailed liz basically asking if they'll provide pizza
2016-06-15 10:47:04	_saracen	We can order somet onight, but if a ton of people come I don't want to be dropping 60 bucks on pizza
2016-06-15 10:47:10	na_th_an	I can throw in
2016-06-15 10:48:08	na_th_an	jesus christ another new version of vivecraft

2016-06-15 10:49:16	na_th_an	omg
2016-06-15 10:49:31	na_th_an	last night I was trying to swing a sword at some enemies and the sword was too short
2016-06-15 10:49:39	na_th_an	so they kept hitting me even though I was swinging at them
2016-06-15 10:49:47	na_th_an	and just this morning it's fixed

2016-06-15 10:55:52	_saracen	Get a few blisters, practice not throwing up from sprinting too much, go drink
2016-06-15 10:55:56	frappi	and make runs
2016-06-15 10:55:58	_saracen	ez pz
2016-06-15 10:56:00	frappi	then run back to midfield and do it again lol
2016-06-15 10:56:10	_saracen	I'm probably going to try for stopper
2016-06-15 10:56:23	frappi	im gonna play center mid because i feel like i should help as much as possible -_-
2016-06-15 10:56:36	frappi	which means running the whole field
2016-06-15 10:56:38	frappi	so
2016-06-15 10:56:42	_saracen	I'd be fine playing striker
2016-06-15 10:56:44	_saracen	lol
2016-06-15 10:57:08	_saracen	Man, I need to stop looking at 3d printer shit until I know mine is on its way

2016-06-15 11:23:44	_saracen	It is indeed raining
2016-06-15 12:56:12	frappi	_saracen: so whats happening in code meeting?
2016-06-15 12:56:26	_saracen	What do you mean?
2016-06-15 12:56:37	_saracen	Time and stuff?
2016-06-15 12:56:51	_saracen	It should be hopefully the same as the other time, but with more actual coding
2016-06-15 12:57:05	_saracen	I've got a few sites to point people at.
2016-06-15 12:57:31	_saracen	I don't think there will be many people this week aside from us
2016-06-15 12:57:48	frappi	okay
2016-06-15 12:59:13	na_th_an	what time is it? do we have a room? we have nothing on our calendar
2016-06-15 12:59:19	_saracen	I know
2016-06-15 12:59:22	_saracen	I'm working on it right now
2016-06-15 12:59:38	_saracen	3:30. SC-107
2016-06-15 12:59:49	frappi	okay
2016-06-15 12:59:59	_saracen	Checking with your manager?
2016-06-15 13:00:06	_saracen	I'm still pretty nervous about inviting everyone
2016-06-15 13:00:13	_saracen	I don't have a ton of material for it
2016-06-15 13:00:33	frappi	Dont invite everyone until you have a solid plan
2016-06-15 13:00:39	na_th_an	have you picked what we're going to do?
2016-06-15 13:00:55	_saracen	I don't want to be the one to pick what everyone does
2016-06-15 13:01:00	na_th_an	I don't want to sit around and decide because we never will
2016-06-15 13:01:14	na_th_an	if someone else wants to pick something they can tell you
2016-06-15 13:01:20	na_th_an	and you can pick their pick
2016-06-15 13:01:40	na_th_an	but I don't want it to be like last time where we sit around and look at a bunch of things we could do
2016-06-15 13:01:53	_saracen	Last time was a planning meeting
2016-06-15 13:01:58	_saracen	Or supposed to be
2016-06-15 13:01:59	na_th_an	well yeah
2016-06-15 13:02:08	_saracen	And you were working the whole time :p
2016-06-15 13:02:10	na_th_an	so that shouldn't happen again
2016-06-15 13:02:14	_saracen	Right
2016-06-15 13:02:23	na_th_an	yeah that was like the height of quickwin bullshit
2016-06-15 13:02:32	_saracen	I know
2016-06-15 13:02:57	frappi	na_th_an: yeah you gave a whole lot of nothing to that meeting
2016-06-15 13:03:10	na_th_an	but I also would like to tell/ask rashmi about this and be able to say something more specific than "coding challenges"
2016-06-15 13:03:21	na_th_an	frappi: honestly I was way too busy to be there and completely forgot it was happening that day
2016-06-15 13:03:30	_saracen	Okay. Well maybe I should just work on this this afternoon and have a nice, professional thing to hand you guys
2016-06-15 13:03:45	_saracen	Yeah, his schedule wasn't really good for ducking out at 3:30
2016-06-15 13:04:04	na_th_an	I'm just worried about it looking like we're sneaking off and goofing around in smith, especially with rashmi
2016-06-15 13:04:29	na_th_an	if you're not directly working on a deliverable it's a waste of time
2016-06-15 13:05:42	_saracen	I guess she gets to make the call. If Dan was here I would ask him about it. He said he had talked to the other managers and that they were onboard with it
2016-06-15 13:05:47	_saracen	But it has taken a while
2016-06-15 13:06:36	na_th_an	well yeah, which is why I want to be able to say what I'd be doing when I go over there
2016-06-15 13:06:59	_saracen	Well, you aren't ever going to have a deliverable from this
2016-06-15 13:07:05	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-15 13:07:10	na_th_an	but she's going to ask what we'd be doing
2016-06-15 13:07:11	_saracen	It is training of sorts
2016-06-15 13:07:24	na_th_an	and it'd be a lot better if I could say "oh we're doing this challenge on this website"
2016-06-15 13:07:29	_saracen	Most of the things I was going to put up for people to pick from this week was going to be ES6 stuff
2016-06-15 13:07:33	na_th_an	or like, "we're working through this set of challenges"
2016-06-15 13:07:49	_saracen	I don't know if it would be better for her to know what website it is on
2016-06-15 13:08:00	na_th_an	even if she doesn't see the specific challenge
2016-06-15 13:08:03	na_th_an	if I could describe it
2016-06-15 13:08:10	na_th_an	or have some idea of what we're doing besides coding training
2016-06-15 13:08:11	_saracen	If we tell her where it is from, she's going to look at it and judge it
2016-06-15 13:08:20	_saracen	Yeah
2016-06-15 13:08:27	na_th_an	because she'd ask me what we're doing right now and I'd say "some kind of coding challenge, ask Stephen"
2016-06-15 13:08:36	na_th_an	and i don't think you want that to come your way :p
2016-06-15 13:08:47	_saracen	God, this lady sounds ridiculous
2016-06-15 13:08:54	na_th_an	she has no chill
2016-06-15 13:09:01	frappi	u talkin bout rashmi
2016-06-15 13:09:02	frappi	yep
2016-06-15 13:09:20	frappi	neither does mela lol
2016-06-15 13:09:30	na_th_an	mela has a slight amount of chill
2016-06-15 13:09:51	na_th_an	very very slight
2016-06-15 13:15:00	frappi	_saracen: i have to leave at like 5:15 today
2016-06-15 13:15:13	_saracen	It sounds like we're not ready to get everyone on board yet
2016-06-15 13:15:46	_saracen	If Rashmi is going to be a terror unless this is perfect
2016-06-15 13:15:52	na_th_an	it doesn't have to be perfect
2016-06-15 13:16:03	na_th_an	and I don't have reason to believe she's going to be a complete terror
2016-06-15 13:16:16	frappi	just pick a challenge somewhere and lets do it
2016-06-15 13:16:17	na_th_an	I just want to have some more plan/idea of what we're doing
2016-06-15 13:16:21	frappi	_saracen: BE ASSERTIVVE lol
2016-06-15 13:16:33	na_th_an	I don't need a 4 page schedule of events
2016-06-15 13:16:37	_saracen	I haven't had time to really get this nicely formatted or even have a firm list of what we are going to do
2016-06-15 13:16:48	_saracen	And emailing to invite people today won't get anyone out
2016-06-15 13:16:50	na_th_an	I don't need to present her a document
2016-06-15 13:17:42	_saracen	I was thinking about doing some ES6 kata's today
2016-06-15 13:18:03	na_th_an	that'd be good
2016-06-15 13:18:10	frappi	https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/basic-cryptanalysis

2016-06-15 13:58:44	na_th_an	I don't think so
2016-06-15 13:58:52	na_th_an	that wouldn't make sense
2016-06-15 13:59:13	frappi	its not yelling me

2016-06-15 14:00:43	na_th_an	maybe he thinks you fixed them
2016-06-15 14:00:45	_saracen	It isn't being updated
2016-06-15 14:00:57	na_th_an	he's probably super worried about everything working bc of how dumb this project is
2016-06-15 14:00:58	_saracen	Why is it even part of the procedure anymore
2016-06-15 14:01:00	na_th_an	and skip is watching it
2016-06-15 14:24:15	_saracen	Well shit
2016-06-15 14:25:40	na_th_an	not the DAPI tests specifically
2016-06-15 14:25:43	na_th_an	obv
2016-06-15 14:25:45	na_th_an	but just like the whole project
2016-06-15 14:25:55	na_th_an	so he's trying to be really sure we don't break existing shit
2016-06-15 14:26:09	frappi	i still dont get why we wrote our own cache service
2016-06-15 14:26:10	frappi	like
2016-06-15 14:26:11	frappi	why
2016-06-15 14:26:14	magic_conch	frappi: chicken thigh
2016-06-15 14:26:28	_saracen	I have no info about it
2016-06-15 14:26:34	_saracen	Could be a wrapper for something someone else wrote
2016-06-15 14:26:39	frappi	na_th_an: wanna do that crypto thing in meeting
2016-06-15 14:26:49	frappi	i wanna solve it
2016-06-15 14:26:54	frappi	alan turing style
2016-06-15 14:27:00	frappi	lets build enigma
2016-06-15 14:27:07	na_th_an	I'm down
2016-06-15 14:27:12	frappi	i wanna try it without google
2016-06-15 14:27:15	frappi	for 30 minutes lol
2016-06-15 14:27:16	na_th_an	I'm not going to go if you're just gonna work on some side project
2016-06-15 14:27:17	frappi	see if we get anywhere
2016-06-15 14:27:27	frappi	no i'll do the crypto thing
2016-06-15 14:27:35	frappi	i wanna get it without help from internet
2016-06-15 14:27:42	na_th_an	I don't think we will in 2 hours
2016-06-15 14:27:45	frappi	lol
2016-06-15 14:27:48	na_th_an	that's poor use of resources
2016-06-15 14:28:04	frappi	internet will just be like "heres how you do it"
2016-06-15 14:28:41	na_th_an	I think it's slightly more complicated than that
2016-06-15 14:29:10	frappi	you have a list of words words and a paragraph on encrypted words
2016-06-15 14:29:21	frappi	so you have to find like patterns i think maybe
2016-06-15 14:29:28	na_th_an	it's like, letter substitutions right?
2016-06-15 14:29:31	frappi	yeah
2016-06-15 14:29:32	frappi	i think
2016-06-15 14:29:56	frappi	is it like turning a wheel
2016-06-15 14:30:03	frappi	probably not...
2016-06-15 14:30:13	frappi	i mean like do the letters still relate in the same way
2016-06-15 14:30:24	frappi	like dog -> eph
2016-06-15 14:30:34	na_th_an	I don't think it's like that
2016-06-15 14:30:40	na_th_an	I think it's just a substitution cipher
2016-06-15 14:30:43	frappi	whatever we will figure it out lol
2016-06-15 14:30:47	na_th_an	we willnot
2016-06-15 14:30:49	frappi	na_th_an: lets go drink
2016-06-15 14:31:02	na_th_an	h/o

2016-06-15 14:47:32	frappi	it looked like a diagram of the layer of the earth lol
2016-06-15 14:47:41	na_th_an	soo.... bedrock/
2016-06-15 14:47:44	na_th_an	?

2016-06-15 14:48:28	frappi	_saracen: this thing is super fruity
2016-06-15 14:48:48	frappi	there should be a law against structuring nutrition facts in paragraph form because its impossible to read
2016-06-15 14:49:16	na_th_an	yeah they should just use YAML
2016-06-15 14:49:30	frappi	they should just make it json
2016-06-15 14:49:37	na_th_an	minified
2016-06-15 14:49:46	frappi	lol
2016-06-15 14:51:28	_saracen	Yeah, it looked like the layers of the earth
2016-06-15 14:55:08	na_th_an	it really sucks that I'm working on this kibana shit after the install
2016-06-15 14:55:16	na_th_an	because there are some statistics I wish I had

2016-06-15 15:25:27	frappi	_saracen: when are you leaving
2016-06-15 15:25:30	Rothlan	yeah, you would have to underperform a lot to even get a negative review

2016-06-16 09:24:07	frappuccino	first time these unit tests have caught a problem I made and not causes a problem lol
2016-06-16 09:30:18	_saracen	JSP sucks
2016-06-16 09:38:04	Rothlan	Soy sucks too
2016-06-16 09:38:12	Rothlan	HTML4Lyf3
2016-06-16 09:43:23	na_th_an	I don't like soy that much
2016-06-16 09:43:26	na_th_an	but I don't hate it
2016-06-16 09:43:59	frappuccino	so what do you do if not template
2016-06-16 09:44:03	frappuccino	ajax?
2016-06-16 09:44:30	na_th_an	with angular you can do all your templating in html
2016-06-16 09:44:38	na_th_an	with angular directives
2016-06-16 09:44:57	frappuccino	and its not server side?
2016-06-16 09:45:00	na_th_an	pretty much any webapp is going to use ajax for some client side rendering
2016-06-16 09:45:10	na_th_an	it makes sense to do all rendering on client side to me
2016-06-16 09:45:13	na_th_an	not a weird mix of the two
2016-06-16 09:45:17	frappuccino	yeah
2016-06-16 09:45:24	na_th_an	that's what url-viewer is
2016-06-16 09:45:31	na_th_an	it's all client side templating
2016-06-16 09:45:43	frappuccino	but what about when you have a backend
2016-06-16 09:46:09	na_th_an	what about it
2016-06-16 09:46:10	frappuccino	views are static and you just make an ajax call to get the stuff?
2016-06-16 09:46:11	na_th_an	ajax
2016-06-16 09:46:13	frappuccino	okay
2016-06-16 09:46:19	frappuccino	i wasn't sure what you meant
2016-06-16 09:46:23	na_th_an	there are things in ui-router for that
2016-06-16 09:46:28	frappuccino	because url-viewer doesn't have a backend
2016-06-16 09:46:38	na_th_an	where you can say like, this view uses this endpoint
2016-06-16 09:46:43	na_th_an	and that endpoint will return json
2016-06-16 09:46:49	frappuccino	correct?
2016-06-16 09:46:53	na_th_an	right
2016-06-16 09:47:04	na_th_an	url viewer is like two html pages and a js page
2016-06-16 09:47:56	frappuccino	how about rashmi completely ignoring your standup status and then asking "what about the kibana stuff"
2016-06-16 09:48:04	frappuccino	and you were like "ya i just said that"
2016-06-16 09:48:23	na_th_an	yeah that was cool
2016-06-16 09:48:31	na_th_an	I like how even when she's here at 9:30 she's still late to standup
2016-06-16 09:49:09	frappuccino	she wants to come over later to assert her dominance lol
2016-06-16 09:49:12	Rothlan	frappuccino: yeah, what na_th_an said, we use AngularJS + plain HTML templates for User Portal
2016-06-16 09:49:17	frappuccino	"i am allowed to come to this meeting late"
2016-06-16 09:51:22	na_th_an	but ya I liked that
2016-06-16 09:51:25	na_th_an	it was neat
2016-06-16 09:54:54	frappuccino	red hot chili peppers is releasing an album tomorrow lol
2016-06-16 09:55:10	abbyaha	Rothlan: how was the wow movie?
2016-06-16 09:55:56	na_th_an	abbyaha: do you know how to add databases to an institution
2016-06-16 09:56:17	frappuccino	you mean like so that you can search them
2016-06-16 09:56:17	na_th_an	I forget which button this is and I can't find it
2016-06-16 09:56:20	na_th_an	ya
2016-06-16 09:56:26	frappuccino	in service config?
2016-06-16 09:56:27	na_th_an	in svc config
2016-06-16 09:58:08	na_th_an	abbyaha going on about athnei again
2016-06-16 10:03:50	frappuccino	na_th_an: so
2016-06-16 10:03:59	frappuccino	you wouldnt happen to know a remote database in ci that works would you
2016-06-16 10:05:15	na_th_an	nope
2016-06-16 10:07:34	frappuccino	jira is down
2016-06-16 10:07:39	frappuccino	lets go home
2016-06-16 10:09:36	frappuccino	i tried to get on 21274 on your mbp to see if your were running dui lol
2016-06-16 10:09:46	frappuccino	ur not
2016-06-16 10:10:08	na_th_an	that doesn't work unless you modify your hosts file
2016-06-16 10:10:23	na_th_an	dns isn't smart enough to know about subdomains
2016-06-16 10:10:54	na_th_an	so when you look up 21274.kesslern-mbpdu.dev.oclc.org it doesn't look up oclc.org then dev then kesslern then 21274
2016-06-16 10:10:57	na_th_an	it does it all at once
2016-06-16 10:11:09	na_th_an	and oclc dns server doesn't know what that is

2016-06-16 14:36:31	na_th_an	drink less soda
2016-06-16 14:36:37	na_th_an	and sugary drinks
2016-06-16 14:36:55	na_th_an	easiest way to be healthier / avoid gaining weight / reduce caloric intake
2016-06-16 14:37:02	frappuccino	but its so good
2016-06-16 14:37:08	na_th_an	you don't have to tell me
2016-06-16 14:37:24	na_th_an	you could try... diet
2016-06-16 14:37:40	na_th_an	like diet soda
2016-06-16 14:38:09	na_th_an	or you could be like me and just not be able to eat more than 1/2 a chipotle burrito at once so you never really eat enough food
2016-06-16 14:38:28	frappuccino	yeah im just gonna eat much much less
2016-06-16 14:38:33	frappuccino	and not eat that entire paida in one sitting

2016-06-16 14:38:48	frappuccino	yaaaaa
2016-06-16 14:38:53	_saracen	Getting rid of is an amazing way to be healthier
2016-06-16 14:38:59	na_th_an	if you drink 2 bottles of soda that's 1/4 of your caloric intake
2016-06-16 14:39:05	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-16 14:39:08	_saracen	I did it for a year and a half once
2016-06-16 14:39:20	na_th_an	I'm slowly reducing the amount of soda I drink
2016-06-16 14:39:23	frappuccino	but then you gave in and were like holy shit how did i stop drinking this
2016-06-16 14:39:28	na_th_an	I just really fucking love coke
2016-06-16 14:39:55	na_th_an	even that vitamin water lemonade has a stupid amount of calories from the sugar
2016-06-16 14:40:12	na_th_an	it makes me kinda mad how the only drinks in the cafe that aren't loaded with sugar are diet or smoothies
2016-06-16 14:40:19	na_th_an	but I suppose that's just the way it is
2016-06-16 14:40:36	_saracen	abbyaha: na_th_an frappuccino Rothlan Coffee?

2016-06-16 14:51:44	na_th_an	there are a lot of things that you can do to lose weight but keeping it off is harder
2016-06-16 14:51:54	na_th_an	you can't just go back to what you were doing before and stay the same
2016-06-16 14:51:57	frappuccino	idk if i would call it weight its just my gut lo.

2016-06-20 10:39:52	_saracen	Or heard about how people do that?
2016-06-20 10:40:20	na_th_an	I have not set up kibana but I don't think it's hard to do
2016-06-20 10:40:53	na_th_an	I've seen people making ELK clusters with raspberry pis
2016-06-20 10:41:25	na_th_an	one guy had a cool visualization that would show which pis were mapping and which were reducing at any given time
2016-06-20 10:42:12	_saracen	Cool
2016-06-20 10:42:31	_saracen	I kind of meant here though
2016-06-20 10:42:35	_saracen	Like, Do I have to talk to Mike

2016-06-20 10:43:46	na_th_an	what do you mean by set up kibana
2016-06-20 10:43:49	na_th_an	like a new dashboard?
2016-06-20 10:43:54	na_th_an	a new application?
2016-06-20 10:43:59	_saracen	Get a new app supported
2016-06-20 10:44:03	na_th_an	no clue
2016-06-20 10:44:06	_saracen	Cool
2016-06-20 10:44:12	na_th_an	I'd search the wiki for 'kibana' and see if I can find anything
2016-06-20 10:44:16	na_th_an	if not, email middleware
2016-06-20 10:44:48	_saracen	I -really- don't want to email middleware about kibana
2016-06-20 10:44:55	frappuccino	DO IT
2016-06-20 10:45:00	frappuccino	exclude mike lol
2016-06-20 10:45:02	_saracen	From what I gather, they hate EUS because we actually use it
2016-06-20 10:45:12	_saracen	And take up all their disk space
2016-06-20 10:45:22	na_th_an	yeah well
2016-06-20 10:45:25	na_th_an	that's not your fault
2016-06-20 10:47:02	na_th_an	JB is talking about getting more people to adopt logstash more
2016-06-20 10:47:03	_saracen	I know, but that doesn't mean that I won't pay for the bad will that's built up for our group
2016-06-20 10:47:35	na_th_an	if it's that big of a deal that you don't want to contact them to get them to do their job and help you do yours it's something you should maybe talk to your manager about
2016-06-20 10:48:02	na_th_an	because that's their job, and regardless of how difficult it is to get infrastructure to give them more disk space, they should still help you
2016-06-20 10:48:46	_saracen	I just want to make absolutely certain that that is their job and that is how they prefer to be contacted about getting that set up
2016-06-20 10:48:56	frappuccino	we should get one of those traffic lights that turns red when people are loud
2016-06-20 10:49:00	na_th_an	omg
2016-06-20 10:49:02	frappuccino	and put it right above JBs monitor
2016-06-20 10:49:02	na_th_an	yes please
2016-06-20 10:49:05	abbyaha	lol
2016-06-20 10:49:08	frappuccino	angled at his face
2016-06-20 10:49:10	abbyaha	nerf guns
2016-06-20 10:49:12	frappuccino	and also an air horn
2016-06-20 10:49:17	frappuccino	and that nerf grenade
2016-06-20 10:49:18	na_th_an	if it gets too loud it should sound a fire alarm
2016-06-20 10:49:22	frappuccino	and when he gets loud
2016-06-20 10:49:23	na_th_an	to drown out JB
2016-06-20 10:49:26	frappuccino	the air horn goes off
2016-06-20 10:49:29	na_th_an	yes
2016-06-20 10:49:32	frappuccino	and he gets shot with nerf guns
2016-06-20 10:49:37	frappuccino	and a strobe light blinds him
2016-06-20 10:49:40	na_th_an	air horn that fires nerf guns that fire nerf darts
2016-06-20 10:49:42	frappuccino	and the traffic light turns red
2016-06-20 10:49:52	frappuccino	ya
2016-06-20 10:50:01	frappuccino	and nickelodian slime falls on him
2016-06-20 10:50:12	frappuccino	and some colonial folks come and tar and feather him
2016-06-20 10:50:19	na_th_an	and then his phone rings BUT NOBODY IS THERE
2016-06-20 10:50:25	frappuccino	then a firefighter comes and hoses him down
2016-06-20 10:50:35	frappuccino	then we wheel in an F-35 to dry him off
2016-06-20 10:50:42	na_th_an	how bored are you

2016-06-20 10:51:27	frappuccino	whatever it was

2016-06-20 10:58:47	na_th_an	I think this is a configurating issue

2016-06-21 08:49:25	abbyaha	why _saracen ?
2016-06-21 08:49:46	na_th_an	by strict definition tea is only leaves from only one plant
2016-06-21 08:49:58	na_th_an	and different kinds of tea are created by fermenting the leaves in different ways
2016-06-21 08:53:11	_saracen	Yeah. When my roommate says he likes Tea, he really means that he likes complicated mixes of a lot of flavorful stuff ontop of some pretty subdued tea
2016-06-21 08:53:21	_saracen	That he then adds sugar too
2016-06-21 08:53:23	_saracen	to

2016-06-21 08:54:11	abbyaha	well he gets davids tea, they add a ton of shit to theirs
2016-06-21 08:54:17	abbyaha	adagio is the best

2016-06-21 10:04:17	keveloper	ya
2016-06-21 10:04:49	abbyaha	its not /awful/ imo but i much prefer cli
2016-06-21 10:04:50	_saracen	and command line is so nice
2016-06-21 10:05:14	abbyaha	i only used it when teaching some people on my team last semester because they refused to switch
2016-06-21 10:05:32	keveloper	_saracen: did you know in vim if you do something (like type a line) then hit . it will do the same thing again
2016-06-21 10:05:34	keveloper	i did not know that
2016-06-21 10:05:41	keveloper	so like i just copy and paste a host name 10 times
2016-06-21 10:05:49	_saracen	I didn't
2016-06-21 10:05:51	keveloper	changed all the numbers to be 01-10
2016-06-21 10:05:55	keveloper	then typed .prod.oclc.org
2016-06-21 10:06:06	keveloper	then did . down arrow . down arrow
2016-06-21 10:06:11	keveloper	to type that after all ten hosts
2016-06-21 10:06:30	keveloper	it has to be all you typed in that insert mode though
2016-06-21 10:06:34	keveloper	its super useful
2016-06-21 10:11:57	_saracen	down arrow
2016-06-21 10:12:04	keveloper	lol
2016-06-21 10:12:05	_saracen	you mean j?

2016-06-21 10:13:07	_saracen	But I currently use the arrows too
2016-06-21 10:13:39	keveloper	dont stop lol
2016-06-21 10:13:42	keveloper	its great
2016-06-21 10:13:44	_saracen	Dwarf Fortress uses hjkl for some commands, so I kind of get it, but I usually end up forgeting which way it goes and get instantly angry when I mess it up
2016-06-21 10:13:47	keveloper	and being able to move in insert mode
2016-06-21 10:14:01	keveloper	that sounds like docking in ksp
2016-06-21 10:14:41	keveloper	you can move both ways on all three axis plus spinning on three axis and its awful
2016-06-21 10:14:47	keveloper	there's like 12 keys you need to press
2016-06-21 10:14:48	_saracen	Insert mode movement is nice
2016-06-21 10:14:50	keveloper	its like
2016-06-21 10:14:58	keveloper	uiop hjkl bnm, or something
2016-06-21 10:15:04	_saracen	I remember ruining it every time
2016-06-21 10:15:13	keveloper	did you play ksp!?
2016-06-21 10:15:16	_saracen	I stopped trying to dock ships
2016-06-21 10:15:17	keveloper	/do
2016-06-21 10:15:19	_saracen	For a little while
2016-06-21 10:15:21	keveloper	its so good
2016-06-21 10:15:30	keveloper	yeah docking took me literally 35 minutes the first time
2016-06-21 10:15:35	_saracen	I got to one of the second planets after a lot of trying and then blew up on landing
2016-06-21 10:15:59	keveloper	lolol
2016-06-21 10:16:09	keveloper	i tried the apollo mission and it was impossible
2016-06-21 10:16:09	_saracen	Stopped after that lol
2016-06-21 10:16:19	keveloper	like having something orbit while your on the moon and then taking off an meeting up with it
2016-06-21 10:16:22	_saracen	It is -so- hard
2016-06-21 10:16:40	_saracen	I think a real joystick might make the docking stuff eaiser
2016-06-21 10:16:45	keveloper	oh yeah
2016-06-21 10:16:52	keveloper	people have made some dope controllers

2016-06-21 10:17:55	keveloper	i got to one of the second planets and rolled on landing and was stuck there lol
2016-06-21 10:18:08	keveloper	everything blew up but the capsule lol
2016-06-21 10:18:57	keveloper	i tried to do a gps thing and that was a failure lol
2016-06-21 10:19:26	keveloper	i tried a polar orbit that was impossible also
2016-06-21 10:19:30	keveloper	that game is so hard lol
2016-06-21 10:19:54	_saracen	Yeah. Space Travel is so difficult
2016-06-21 10:19:57	keveloper	i tried a geostationary orbit that was impossible lol
2016-06-21 10:20:17	keveloper	anything besides doing a simple orbit or just launching yourself at the moon is impossible lol
2016-06-21 10:21:13	keveloper	we tried the apollo thing like 70 times and never succesfully did it
2016-06-21 10:21:48	keveloper	launch to orbit, flip around the capsule, dock, burn to the moon, undock, land, leave the rocket orbiting, take off, meet in orbit, dock, go back to kerbal
2016-06-21 10:22:02	keveloper	its like the standard "you are kind of good at this game now thing" lol and we never got anywhere close
2016-06-21 10:22:17	keveloper	how the fuck did they do that in 1969
2016-06-21 10:28:15	_saracen	With computers that were less powerful than an NES
2016-06-21 10:29:00	_saracen	keveloper: did you see that full-res picture of the soccer team?

2016-06-21 16:13:03	na_th_an	yeah I saw
2016-06-21 16:13:04	keveloper	It’s an issue with SSH that someone would need to take the time to truly debug with ssh -vvvv to try and reproduce the error with more output
2016-06-21 16:13:05	keveloper	lo
2016-06-21 16:13:07	keveloper	lol*

2016-06-21 16:13:15	na_th_an	he's right
2016-06-21 16:13:26	keveloper	okay but the error says that very clearly lol
2016-06-21 16:13:29	na_th_an	there's literally nothing anyone can say besides "it was broken at that second" with the given information
2016-06-21 16:13:30	keveloper	i think nathan knew that
2016-06-21 16:13:58	keveloper	nathan knows that he was just inquiring if anyone investigated it already
2016-06-21 16:14:11	na_th_an	I don't think Adam thinks nathan didn't know that he'd get more information with -vvvv

2016-06-22 14:19:43	keveloper	na_th_an: focused on double letters to find possible matches
2016-06-22 14:19:58	keveloper	start with longest words
2016-06-22 14:20:08	keveloper	to get most letters, and have least amount of possibilites for the word mapping
2016-06-22 14:22:54	keveloper	na_th_an: whats your idea
2016-06-22 14:23:13	na_th_an	pretty much that
2016-06-22 14:23:19	na_th_an	you'd start with 'a' in the coded words
2016-06-22 14:23:37	na_th_an	figure out which translation of 'a' matches the most dictionary words
2016-06-22 14:24:04	na_th_an	do that with each character

2016-06-24 13:22:21	na_th_an	you might have to add http://

2016-06-24 13:22:41	na_th_an	if chrome gave you the whole URL it wouldn't do that
2016-06-24 13:23:10	na_th_an	it works in urlviewer because it shows the https in the address bar

2016-06-29 14:08:51	abbyaha	so i was speaking to them all yesterday
2016-06-29 14:08:53	abbyaha	had my check copy
2016-06-29 14:09:02	abbyaha	and they were like lol no fuck you we dont have to do shit
2016-06-29 14:09:25	na_th_an	why did you pay for rent at the end of the lease
2016-06-29 14:09:30	na_th_an	that doesn't make sense
2016-06-29 14:10:09	abbyaha	yea i agree
2016-06-29 14:10:21	na_th_an	like why did you even do taht
2016-06-29 14:10:38	na_th_an	did you give them a check for rent in august that was for rent for july of the next year?
2016-06-29 14:10:44	abbyaha	yea
2016-06-29 14:10:47	na_th_an	why
2016-06-29 14:10:47	magic_conch	na_th_an: chicken thigh
2016-06-29 14:10:51	na_th_an	why would you even write that check
2016-06-29 14:11:08	abbyaha	because they said it was normal practice for them
2016-06-29 14:11:13	na_th_an	and if you did, did you write it was for ren of next year? was it in your lease?
2016-06-29 14:11:17	na_th_an	that sounds super shady to me
2016-06-29 14:11:21	abbyaha	it was supposed to be
2016-06-29 14:11:25	abbyaha	it is
2016-06-29 14:11:27	na_th_an	like they knew they were gonna sell the property and it wasn't in the lease
2016-06-29 14:11:36	keveloper	are you talking about paying for your first and last month when you move in
2016-06-29 14:11:39	keveloper	because thats a thing
2016-06-29 14:11:39	abbyaha	they did sell the property
2016-06-29 14:12:05	na_th_an	keveloper: are you talking about security deposit or is this in addition to a security deposit
2016-06-29 14:12:12	abbyaha	in addition
2016-06-29 14:12:14	keveloper	in addition too
2016-06-29 14:12:16	keveloper	to*
2016-06-29 14:12:25	na_th_an	so you paid 3 months rent when you signed the lease
2016-06-29 14:12:27	keveloper	its to keep people who won't be able to afford it out i think
2016-06-29 14:12:32	na_th_an	but it doesn't say in the lease that you did that?
2016-06-29 14:13:15	abbyaha	ours was pay for all of august even though we moved in august 19th, then dont pay july that we move out
2016-06-29 14:13:25	abbyaha	he only wrote down that we pay for all of august
2016-06-29 14:13:54	abbyaha	they fired the guy we worked with initally too
2016-06-29 14:13:57	na_th_an	isn't that in the lease you signed though?
2016-06-29 14:14:08	keveloper	"But if you wish at once to do nothing and to be respectable nowdays, the best pretext is to be at work on some profound study" lol
2016-06-29 14:14:10	na_th_an	there shouldn't be anything to write down because it's part of your lease agreement that your paid for july when you signed it
2016-06-29 14:14:31	na_th_an	I'm confused why this wouldn't be in your lease
2016-06-29 14:14:48	abbyaha	ill just explain in person tomorrow
2016-06-29 14:14:57	abbyaha	its easier

2016-07-05 09:10:41	keveloper	keep in mind the only thing telling us not to go was at the very bottom of an inside story
2016-07-05 09:10:59	keveloper	and all it said was "we are not extending the invitation"
2016-07-05 09:11:06	na_th_an	they sent out like 3 or 4 emails telling people there was no fireworks viewing

2016-07-05 09:14:45	_saracen	Okay. So.. How are we going to do this?
2016-07-05 09:15:13	keveloper	_saracen: dunno
2016-07-05 09:15:14	_saracen	Is there a guide anywhere from the environments people?

2016-07-05 09:24:46	na_th_an	it's an app
2016-07-05 09:24:48	na_th_an	I think
2016-07-05 09:24:49	_saracen	keveloper: Do you guys have a ticket?
2016-07-05 09:24:58	_saracen	Yeah, Powered by Flask and Peewee
2016-07-05 09:25:04	keveloper	_saracen: huh
2016-07-05 09:25:21	_saracen	keveloper: Like.. I was told I am doing 'snowflake stuff'
2016-07-05 09:25:24	keveloper	lol
2016-07-05 09:25:33	_saracen	Not exactly a great way to go about getting a major task done
2016-07-05 09:25:37	keveloper	i think we have an epic of our stuff
2016-07-05 09:26:48	na_th_an	I'm compiling DUI in gradle and indexing DUI in intellij
2016-07-05 09:26:51	na_th_an	my macbook is struggling
2016-07-05 09:27:14	keveloper	_saracen: we have this epic 3
2016-07-05 09:27:20	keveloper	https://jira.oclc.org/browse/DA-20853
2016-07-05 09:27:22	magic_conch	[ Log in - Issue Tracker ] - https://jira.oclc.org
2016-07-05 09:29:31	_saracen	Nice
2016-07-05 09:29:43	keveloper	i'm assuming you will be doing different projects tho
2016-07-05 09:30:04	_saracen	So this task sounded like we are just going into our install scripts and changing stuff until it works in each new environment?
2016-07-05 09:42:01	keveloper	install scripts you just have to change the deploy hosts
2016-07-05 09:42:24	keveloper	in the project we'll have to change all of our dependencies, firefly, idm, DS, blah blah blah
2016-07-05 09:42:48	na_th_an	ya that's all it is
2016-07-05 09:42:59	na_th_an	change the hosts you install on and the hosts you point at
2016-07-05 09:43:22	na_th_an	I say confidently as someone who has spent no time doing any of that work
2016-07-05 09:44:41	keveloper	lol you are correct
2016-07-05 09:45:45	keveloper	_saracen: 
2016-07-05 09:45:45	keveloper	http://hollandk-1mbpdu.oa.oclc.org:8080/product/query/?sql=SELECT+DISTINCT+dev_server%0D%0AFROM+%22product%22%0D%0AWHERE+amp_group%3D%22Discovery%22%0D%0AAND+dev_server%21%3D%22%22
2016-07-05 09:45:46	_saracen	So there is supposed to be some amount of coordination between us, but really we are just trying stuff and when we find something that works we will let each other know?
2016-07-05 09:45:52	keveloper	check out those new server names
2016-07-05 09:46:10	keveloper	guess so lol
2016-07-05 09:46:34	keveloper	the only thing we've really done is I made this database, and jinbin used it to find questions for the snowflake team
2016-07-05 09:46:38	keveloper	and thats about it
2016-07-05 09:46:39	_saracen	Are these the servers that Jin bin tested and found that they are broken
2016-07-05 09:46:59	keveloper	he found some that were set up wrong using this
2016-07-05 09:47:54	na_th_an	P3 incident plz
2016-07-05 09:48:43	abbyaha	what
2016-07-05 09:48:43	magic_conch	abbyaha: chicken butt
2016-07-05 09:48:45	abbyaha	why
2016-07-05 09:48:45	magic_conch	abbyaha: chicken thigh
2016-07-05 09:48:47	abbyaha	is there one?
2016-07-05 09:48:57	keveloper	no he is requesting one
2016-07-05 09:49:51	na_th_an	for the fucked up servers
2016-07-05 09:50:25	keveloper	he is joke
2016-07-05 09:56:50	_saracen	keveloper: Are those broken ones fixed in here now?
2016-07-05 09:57:01	keveloper	_saracen: what do you mean
2016-07-05 09:57:13	_saracen	The emssed up server names / load balancer things
2016-07-05 09:57:50	keveloper	I don't think there are any messed up server names... The load balancer thing I doubt is fixed, the missing servers I doubt made yet
2016-07-05 09:59:01	_saracen	Whitney was saying that Jinbin tried the server names and none of them were right
2016-07-05 09:59:29	keveloper	the farms for discovery don't work
2016-07-05 09:59:34	keveloper	that might be what he meant
2016-07-05 09:59:58	keveloper	they are missing our canned server but that might be intentional
2016-07-05 10:00:59	keveloper	na_th_an: tony chirakos friend requested emily on fb

2016-07-06 12:09:51	keveloper	then the retailer charges that virtual account number, which goes to google, and google charges your actual account

2016-07-06 12:10:20	keveloper	pretty sure its NFC communicating with RFID technology

2016-07-06 12:21:25	na_th_an	if you liked blink-182's newer stuff at all (take off your pants and jacket, their self titled album) then you'll probably like it
2016-07-06 12:21:37	na_th_an	it's the natural evolution of where their sound should have gone

2016-07-06 12:22:02	na_th_an	if you don't like that then you don't like blink-182 and shouldn't listen to the album

2016-07-06 12:22:32	keveloper	they did have some super good songs in like 2003 though

2016-07-06 13:40:29	Rothlan	_saracen: I can't make it, got to get this session handling in before the prod fix
2016-07-06 13:40:36	_saracen	Haha
2016-07-06 13:40:37	abbyaha	fun fun
2016-07-06 13:40:49	_saracen	Might not have it. Got two tenative attendees
2016-07-06 13:40:58	_saracen	And me and abs
2016-07-06 13:41:02	_saracen	We'll see, I guess
2016-07-06 13:41:14	Rothlan	who are the tenatives?  are they cool? :)
2016-07-06 13:41:27	abbyaha	idk might be nice to at least go over there, change in scenery to work in any case
2016-07-06 13:41:39	_saracen	JB and Ruchi
2016-07-06 13:41:48	_saracen	I'm kind of hoping JB doesn't come lol
2016-07-06 13:41:48	na_th_an	Ruchi?
2016-07-06 13:41:54	_saracen	She is on innova
2016-07-06 13:42:05	Rothlan	lol, yeah, it would be hard with JB there
2016-07-06 13:42:17	_saracen	Yeah!
2016-07-06 13:42:32	_saracen	I mean, it might be fun, but I would be worried about looking dumb in front of him
2016-07-06 13:42:33	abbyaha	idk he could be fun
2016-07-06 13:43:03	na_th_an	ya I could see it working with him because he really wants time to just code something
2016-07-06 13:43:09	na_th_an	pair programming with him was good
2016-07-06 13:43:16	na_th_an	I could also see him derailing everything
2016-07-06 13:45:35	_saracen	Lol
2016-07-06 13:45:49	abbyaha	i think he could bring a lot to it
2016-07-06 13:45:53	abbyaha	since he is so smart
2016-07-06 13:45:53	_saracen	I am pretty sure Mallesh's listed git email address is just his ssh password
2016-07-06 13:46:15	_saracen	na_th_an: That is what I am afraid of
2016-07-06 13:46:50	_saracen	If he doesn't find it interesting, I don't have enough social capital or charm for this not to become some overly loud conversation in the pod someday
2016-07-06 13:46:59	_saracen	About how it was a waste of time or something like that lol
2016-07-06 13:47:24	keveloper	who cares you took initiative to try to start something
2016-07-06 13:47:34	abbyaha	well since you leave it open for us to do things we want to do, not finding it interesting is on him
2016-07-06 13:47:37	keveloper	you can't tell whether or not it will useful and successful yet, just go with it 100%
2016-07-06 13:47:45	_saracen	I'm going to keep doing it
2016-07-06 13:47:56	_saracen	Even if it is just abby and I over there today
2016-07-06 13:48:09	_saracen	I still want it to go well though xD
2016-07-06 13:48:26	_saracen	Because it would be a lot of fun if we got a bunch of devs over there and did some cool shit

2016-07-06 14:08:15	abbyaha	lol well we will have fun, and maybe ruchi
2016-07-06 14:08:32	abbyaha	might be cool to look at algorithm specific things
2016-07-06 14:09:12	na_th_an	study sort algorithms and report your findings to FIND
2016-07-06 14:09:21	abbyaha	lol
2016-07-06 14:09:38	_saracen	It appears that the 'search through a big fucking list one at a time' algorithm isn't super efficient, guys
2016-07-06 14:09:59	Rothlan	man...what about the randomly look through a list?
2016-07-06 14:10:33	_saracen	You get lucky sometimes
2016-07-06 14:10:44	_saracen	That could be an improvement
2016-07-06 14:10:58	_saracen	I think they  have the speed down
2016-07-06 14:11:18	_saracen	It is more their stance on the completeness of result sets and consistency
2016-07-06 14:13:07	abbyaha	wtf
2016-07-06 14:13:09	_saracen	Umm

2016-07-06 14:22:54	na_th_an	there are some really cheap 980Ti's going on sale
2016-07-06 14:22:58	na_th_an	that are still not worth it
2016-07-06 14:23:02	Rothlan	I was going to say
2016-07-06 14:23:17	na_th_an	$400 for a 980Ti is pretty close to worth it
2016-07-06 14:23:44	Rothlan	1080 master race!  Actually I'm waiting till I can do 4k ultra at 60 fps
2016-07-06 14:24:01	Rothlan	course I'd have to buy a new monitor too...
2016-07-06 14:24:05	na_th_an	I need a 1080 so I can do project cars in glorious 90fps on my Vive
2016-07-06 14:24:11	na_th_an	and supersample everything :)
2016-07-06 14:26:29	na_th_an	my dad just asked me if I can get him and his friends tickets to the nebraska game at OSU
2016-07-06 14:26:36	na_th_an	since I like, graduated from there recently and such
2016-07-06 14:26:50	na_th_an	and I can! I just need to become a member for the low, low price of $250 per year!
2016-07-06 14:26:59	na_th_an	don't worry, it's discounted, and you can keep that price for 5 years!
2016-07-06 14:27:11	na_th_an	($250 does not include the tickets)
2016-07-06 14:31:05	_saracen	My dad became a life member for less than that
2016-07-06 14:31:30	abbyaha	wtf
2016-07-06 14:31:40	abbyaha	my dad was planning on asking the same of me
2016-07-06 14:31:45	na_th_an	$250/yr for 5 years then you have to 'upgrade' to a scarlet or grey package
2016-07-06 14:31:57	na_th_an	there might be a way to just get a couple tickets (not season tickets) without having to pay all that
2016-07-06 14:32:11	na_th_an	my sister said when she graduated you got 1 year free to buy tickets without having to pay to become a member
2016-07-06 14:32:14	abbyaha	i hope so because damn
2016-07-06 14:32:17	_saracen	I think you have to be a member just to get in the lottery
2016-07-06 14:32:29	na_th_an	but that was 4 years before I graduated so surely they've found more ways to extract money from their student body
2016-07-06 14:32:43	_saracen	They just made life memberships not a thing in the last five years
2016-07-06 14:33:00	_saracen	Because, you know, people don't stay alumni their whole lives
2016-07-06 14:33:10	na_th_an	I seriously hate OSU
2016-07-06 14:33:19	na_th_an	I'm glad they have a good name and that my piece of paper has their name on it

2016-07-07 09:23:47	na_th_an	wait what
2016-07-07 09:26:32	keveloper	we scheduled the DUI CSDC install for friday
2016-07-07 09:26:43	keveloper	i made the service now request to promote it yesterday at 3
2016-07-07 09:27:01	keveloper	this morning we realized it can't be approved until the promote is done
2016-07-07 09:27:16	keveloper	so i email middleware: "Please do what you can to complete this ticket as fast as possible."
2016-07-07 09:27:38	keveloper	and bill graham replied "This ticket was submitted at 3pm yesterday.  We have a lot of work ahead of this.  If this was needed for an install tomorrow morning it should have been submitted earlier."
2016-07-07 09:28:22	keveloper	sorry you cant hit 6 buttons in quickbuild really quick
2016-07-07 09:29:29	Rothlan	they are pretty busy right now
2016-07-07 09:29:34	na_th_an	god forbid we want to do an install in less than 3 days
2016-07-07 09:29:35	Rothlan	lots of installs
2016-07-07 09:30:33	keveloper	Rothlan: why are there priorities in service now tickets if the team is just going to say "you shouldve submitted this earlier"
2016-07-07 09:30:50	abbyaha	maybe a lot of them are the same priority
2016-07-07 09:32:40	Rothlan	I always thought the priorities were pretty stupid when I filled out the change now forms, but I guess if they aren't busy it helps them prioritize stuff.  I just know right now they are crushed with all the installs/prod fixes for the brand new roll out
2016-07-07 09:55:05	_saracen	I think priorities give you the chance to ensure that your task gets done later than 'whenever your ticket comes up'

2016-07-07 09:58:32	_saracen	They haven't set up our shit yet

2016-07-07 10:07:34	na_th_an	_saracen: idk if you've upgraded your laptop recently
2016-07-07 10:07:43	_saracen	I haven't
2016-07-07 10:07:59	na_th_an	but I'm pretty sure the reason that I was getting that black screen error is because I somehow forgot to add my boot partition to my fstab
2016-07-07 10:08:04	na_th_an	so it isn't mounted by default
2016-07-07 10:08:20	na_th_an	so when I upgraded my kernel, the new kernel was written to /boot on my root partition instead of the boot partition
2016-07-07 10:08:37	na_th_an	so when I rebooted I actually booted back to the old kernel
2016-07-07 10:08:46	na_th_an	but all the modules on my root were for the new kernel
2016-07-07 10:08:53	na_th_an	so... black screen
2016-07-07 10:09:11	na_th_an	I feel pretty dumb about it all
2016-07-07 10:09:23	_saracen	Oooh
2016-07-07 10:09:29	_saracen	I will have to make sure I don't do that
2016-07-07 10:09:38	na_th_an	I also found out that ctrl+shift+tab doesn't work in windows either, when caps is used as ctrl
2016-07-07 10:09:42	_saracen	How do you recommend upgrading?
2016-07-07 10:09:44	na_th_an	UNLESS you release shift
2016-07-07 10:09:50	_saracen	huh

2016-07-07 10:09:57	_saracen	Cool
2016-07-07 10:10:01	na_th_an	so you know how I do caps lock as control
2016-07-07 10:10:02	_saracen	I can type that
2016-07-07 10:10:07	_saracen	I do that on that laptop
2016-07-07 10:10:21	na_th_an	ok so you know ctrl+tab and ctrl+shift+tab in the browser?
2016-07-07 10:10:25	_saracen	Caps lock is ctrl is super awesome
2016-07-07 10:10:31	_saracen	Yeah
2016-07-07 10:10:40	na_th_an	if you hold ctrl and caps lock on your zenbook
2016-07-07 10:10:42	na_th_an	then press tab
2016-07-07 10:10:44	na_th_an	nothing will happen
2016-07-07 10:10:46	na_th_an	but
2016-07-07 10:10:54	na_th_an	err
2016-07-07 10:11:00	na_th_an	hold shift and caps lock
2016-07-07 10:11:03	na_th_an	then press tab
2016-07-07 10:11:06	na_th_an	nothing will happen
2016-07-07 10:11:24	na_th_an	but if you hold tab and caps lock then press and release shift, it will correctly get the keypress
2016-07-07 10:11:35	_saracen	weird
2016-07-07 10:11:38	_saracen	Know why?

2016-07-07 12:24:30	_saracen	Good!
2016-07-07 12:24:57	_saracen	I was able to clear the fuck up from the day before pretty easily. Just got pliers and heated up the hotend and it popped free pretty easily
2016-07-07 12:25:22	na_th_an	sweet
2016-07-07 12:25:25	_saracen	I have to do a ton of tweaking now to get it printing perfectly
2016-07-07 12:25:28	abbyaha	what are you going to make next?
2016-07-07 12:25:36	_saracen	But my starting point is waaaaaaay better than most people's
2016-07-07 12:25:42	_saracen	I don't know
2016-07-07 12:25:46	na_th_an	is that because you're smart or luckyi
2016-07-07 12:25:53	abbyaha	both
2016-07-07 12:25:56	_saracen	I bought a good printer
2016-07-07 12:26:44	_saracen	All quality parts rather than cheap chinese stepper drivers and shit. The design is the same as a lot of other printers, but this one has a really good heated bed, one of the better extruders, and nice firmware out of the box
2016-07-07 12:27:08	_saracen	I also apparently built it well because all of the holes I've printed have been dimensionally good

2016-07-07 12:44:03	keveloper	there's this midi controller i want really badly but it got bad reviews because of key sensitivity and i have to convince myself not to get it
2016-07-07 12:46:49	na_th_an	it has bad reviews
2016-07-07 12:46:51	na_th_an	don't get it
2016-07-07 12:52:37	keveloper	but it also has good reviews
2016-07-07 12:52:44	keveloper	average reviews are like 4 stars
2016-07-07 12:52:45	keveloper	3.7 stars
2016-07-07 12:52:55	na_th_an	that's not bad
2016-07-07 12:53:25	abbyaha	get a better one?
2016-07-07 12:54:43	keveloper	i also read that they ship the keyboard with a really shitty velocity curve setting and you can change it
2016-07-07 12:55:01	abbyaha	why do you have to get that specific one?
2016-07-07 12:55:01	keveloper	so i'm assuming some people didn't know how to change it and got mad and returned it
2016-07-07 12:55:13	keveloper	i dont i am just interested
2016-07-07 12:55:21	na_th_an	treat yourself
2016-07-07 12:55:25	abbyaha	if you want one then get one with better reviews
2016-07-07 12:55:27	abbyaha	idk

2016-07-07 12:55:51	keveloper	and also some people were expecting to play piano on a semi-weighted keyboard and expect it to sound like piano which is dumb so
2016-07-07 12:55:56	keveloper	and 4 star is not that bad
2016-07-07 12:56:15	keveloper	especially when there are probably misinformed 1 star reviews

2016-07-07 15:58:09	na_th_an	I realized the other day that I have a complete extra computer sitting around my house
2016-07-07 15:58:25	na_th_an	I have 2 spare motherboard/CPU combos, one with DDR2 and one with DDR3
2016-07-07 15:58:36	na_th_an	I have like 6GB of DDR2 memory sitting around
2016-07-07 15:58:38	na_th_an	an extra PSU and case
2016-07-07 15:58:51	na_th_an	and a 16GB flash drive that can run linux
2016-07-07 16:21:07	_saracen	Rothlan: do you know how to log the feature ID?
2016-07-07 16:21:11	_saracen	Do you need another appender or?
2016-07-07 16:21:50	na_th_an	why the fuck can't I find out how to look up an oclc number
2016-07-07 16:22:01	na_th_an	you'd think that'd be in the BibServiceESL

2016-07-07 16:32:19	Rothlan	_saracen: we just log the text FI-257 or something like that
2016-07-07 16:33:33	_saracen	But there is an annotation that should be doing it for us

2016-07-11 08:51:34	keveloper	you cant go 270 -> 33 -> avery
2016-07-11 08:51:45	keveloper	you have no choice but to start going the other way on 33 back where you came from
2016-07-11 08:51:47	na_th_an	are you sure
2016-07-11 08:51:49	keveloper	yes

2016-07-12 14:27:57	_saracen	I don't think so
2016-07-12 14:29:00	_saracen	We own EntActUI, which you guys should really own
2016-07-12 14:29:09	_saracen	And we own Dapi, which you guys should also probably own lol
2016-07-12 14:31:22	na_th_an	jeff is under the impression that we own EntActUI
2016-07-12 14:31:33	na_th_an	I believe

2016-07-12 14:43:49	_saracen	We arranged a trade with you guys to do the migration
2016-07-12 14:44:29	_saracen	EntActUI needs code changes that will correspond to Enterprise Activation's code changes to get them into the new environment, so we decided it would be better for one team to do that and for us to take on some of your other work

2016-07-14 08:54:00	na_th_an	you know that there's like
2016-07-14 08:54:05	na_th_an	stupid logic with the order of lookup keys
2016-07-14 08:54:12	na_th_an	and the collection/source collection
2016-07-14 08:54:21	keveloper	yeah
2016-07-14 08:54:31	keveloper	so can i not do
2016-07-14 08:54:35	keveloper	dbname.z-pnz=Publications New Zealand
2016-07-14 08:54:41	keveloper	if z-pnz is part of worldcat
2016-07-14 08:54:54	na_th_an	it might need to be like
2016-07-14 08:55:00	na_th_an	dbname.shortname.z-pnz
2016-07-14 08:55:07	na_th_an	the case could be wrong possibly
2016-07-14 08:55:18	keveloper	i tried Z-pnz
2016-07-14 08:55:18	na_th_an	there are a few different lookup things it does it's really dumb
2016-07-14 08:55:26	na_th_an	go into the debugger and see what it's looking up
2016-07-14 08:55:27	keveloper	it sais z-pnz in configurator
2016-07-14 08:55:35	keveloper	idk where that happens
2016-07-14 08:56:38	na_th_an	there's CollectionNameOrderedSearch

2016-07-14 08:59:48	na_th_an	he knows
2016-07-14 08:59:52	abbyaha	so i was in the second to the left lane heading towards the 33 exit
2016-07-14 09:00:01	keveloper	is dbname.shortname a thing
2016-07-14 09:00:02	abbyaha	and i was next to this construction vehicle
2016-07-14 09:00:06	na_th_an	keveloper: I think
2016-07-14 09:00:08	na_th_an	debugger is bae
2016-07-14 09:00:22	abbyaha	i couldnt see anything going on there because an 18 wheeler was in front of me
2016-07-14 09:00:34	abbyaha	but apparently pulled off on the shoulder was a trooper
2016-07-14 09:00:45	abbyaha	and the construction vehicle needed to either stop or get over
2016-07-14 09:00:53	abbyaha	and instead of stopping and waiting to get over
2016-07-14 09:01:01	abbyaha	he forced me right the fuck out of my lane
2016-07-14 09:01:05	abbyaha	almost causing another accident
2016-07-14 09:01:13	abbyaha	it was great
2016-07-14 09:02:03	na_th_an	why was the trooper a part of the story I'm confused
2016-07-14 09:02:20	abbyaha	the trooper was half on the shoulder and half in the lane
2016-07-14 09:02:30	abbyaha	so the construction vehicle had to get around him
2016-07-14 09:02:31	na_th_an	oh
