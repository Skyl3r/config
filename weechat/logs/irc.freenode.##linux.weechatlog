2017-01-09 18:41:41	bls	that or it's routing the mail through your local MDA and getting that error back
2017-01-09 18:41:45	keveloper	anyone ever put arch on a 2011 mbp? (not dual boot)

2017-01-09 18:42:03	bster	bls: cool thanks, I'll see if I can find some logs
2017-01-09 18:42:39	bls	bster: you should be able to forward the mail to another valid user
2017-01-09 18:42:45	czart	bls: considering Python development, virtualenv seems inevitable. But, I am also going to test Docker official containers and likely build my own customized images. Do you have experience with both?

2017-01-09 18:43:12	bster	bls: well, git's email should be working, so if it's not i should fix that
2017-01-09 18:43:13	bls	czart: python yes. I've avoided docker
2017-01-09 18:43:15	czart	officail containers = offical images on thier hub, I mean

2017-01-09 18:43:26	phogg	realtime: the default behavior of cron is to email the cron job owner with the output of any job
2017-01-09 18:43:37	czart	bls: any particular reason to avoid dockerized environment?
2017-01-09 18:43:41	krocodactyl	keveloper: surely someone has done that at somepoint, yes
2017-01-09 18:43:48	phogg	realtime: I say email, but it just delivers to the local spool unless you configure otherwise

2017-01-09 18:44:52	czart	bls: yes, that's true. Although, I do not care about security at the moment, it may turn very important soon.
2017-01-09 18:44:54	Danilochka	Hello, is there a way to strictly find a file using the 'locate' command, as in find a file with that exact name and not files that include that name?
2017-01-09 18:44:54	bls	prebuilt docker containers are almost becomming the mystery binary from download.com of the linux world

2017-01-09 18:45:05	faLUCE	hello. Is there a good way for reseting an usb device by command line? I found that:   http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/234581/disconnect-and-reconnect-usb-port-via-cli    It works, but it seems a bit unstable and I'm suspicious about it
2017-01-09 18:45:10	B0g4r7	Low quality security seems to be pretty ubiquitous these days.
2017-01-09 18:45:25	B0g4r7	:shakes head:
2017-01-09 18:46:22	bls	czart: and none of the python stuff I'm working on is in a state to be containerized just yet, but when it does, I was leaning more towards the LXC ecosystem
