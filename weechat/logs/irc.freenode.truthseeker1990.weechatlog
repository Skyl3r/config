2017-07-17 11:45:10	keveloper	Also pretty messy as it was for school and I was rushing the last couple days :P
2017-07-17 11:46:05	truthseeker1990	I do work in java too. Java and python. Thank you. I will take a look. School? How old are you
2017-07-17 11:46:11	truthseeker1990	I was hoping you were at least in your 40s

2017-07-17 12:19:59	keveloper	I'm 23, graduated a little over a year ago lol
2017-07-17 12:22:43	truthseeker1990	I hate you lol Are you at least in the web dev field? Doing it on a regular basis?
2017-07-17 12:22:57	keveloper	Yeah I have a full time job as a full stack java developer
2017-07-17 12:23:08	truthseeker1990	I have been coding since I was 9 but just recently had to get into web dev to host a few projects
2017-07-17 12:23:14	keveloper	Ah okay
2017-07-17 12:23:16	keveloper	How old are you?
2017-07-17 12:23:48	keveloper	I have an unusual amount of experience for being 23 I think
2017-07-17 12:23:54	truthseeker1990	Its a great way to showcase your projects rather than just having a github repo with code in it....I am 27, graduated a few months ago
2017-07-17 12:24:13	keveloper	Half luck/half meeting people that were way better than me telling me I was bad lol
2017-07-17 12:24:25	keveloper	What was your major?
2017-07-17 12:24:27	keveloper	CS?
2017-07-17 12:26:14	keveloper	And yeah as far as the way to showcase work goes. I just finished a personal portfolio for myself a month or so ago: http://kevinholland.me/
2017-07-17 12:26:36	keveloper	Haven't really shown anybody because I haven't had a new client in freelance world at all but... pretty proud of it haha
2017-07-17 12:26:59	keveloper	Surprisingly haven't been spammed by bots yet because there is no protection on the contact form (lol woops)
