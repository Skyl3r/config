2016-07-21 09:39:45	_saracen	It looks like some companies still sell Verizon versions
2016-07-21 09:40:03	_saracen	Which made me unsure of if those Sim cards were alL I needed
2016-07-21 09:40:07	keveloper	Yeah verizon still sells their android phone with their bullshit on it
2016-07-21 09:40:32	_saracen	I think I am going to hold off for HTC's nexus
2016-07-21 09:40:34	keveloper	Yeah if you're on Verizon and you buy a 6P you'll be fine. iPhone 5 has a nano sim
2016-07-21 09:40:47	keveloper	oh whens that happening
2016-07-21 09:40:49	_saracen	Oh really? I won't even need to buy one?
2016-07-21 09:40:56	_saracen	Late August or September
2016-07-21 09:41:01	_saracen	I'm guessing September
2016-07-21 09:41:20	keveloper	No you can use your existing one. Literally all I did was turn on my 6P, it was like "insert SIM card to activate". I took it out of my M8 and it put it in and it worked
2016-07-21 09:41:26	_saracen	Hell yes
2016-07-21 09:41:30	_saracen	That is exciting
2016-07-21 09:41:36	keveloper	Yeah it is very exciting lol
2016-07-21 09:41:43	keveloper	I didn't go to the verizon store once
2016-07-21 09:41:52	keveloper	I do want to switch to Fi, but I haven't decided yet.
2016-07-21 09:42:07	_saracen	I've thought about it. Verizon's new plan makes it less beneficial to go to FI
2016-07-21 09:42:44	_saracen	The only benefit is international calling and getting credit for unused data
2016-07-21 09:43:06	keveloper	The nexus sailfish?
2016-07-21 09:43:30	_saracen	Which everyone is going to have Android N on it and be made by HTC
2016-07-21 09:43:32	keveloper	BTW USB C is amazing
2016-07-21 09:43:56	_saracen	Not sure if it will be Sailfish of Marlin
2016-07-21 09:44:05	_saracen	Yeah, I'm looking forward to that becoming more of the standard
2016-07-21 09:44:13	_saracen	Unless those are the same thing lol
2016-07-21 09:44:27	keveloper	It seems like they are not the same thing
2016-07-21 09:44:40	_saracen	I keep seeing it written as Marlin/Sailfish
2016-07-21 09:44:53	_saracen	Maybe the premium version and the more entry level version
2016-07-21 09:44:58	keveloper	I just saw Marlin and Sailfish
2016-07-21 09:45:03	_saracen	Okay
2016-07-21 09:45:09	keveloper	Yeah I assume it'll just be like 5X vs 6P
2016-07-21 09:45:14	keveloper	maybe a big one and a small one
2016-07-21 09:45:32	keveloper	Is a sailfish bigger than a marlin lol
2016-07-21 09:45:56	keveloper	Marlins are much bigger than sailfish lol
2016-07-21 09:46:29	_saracen	Oh yeah
2016-07-21 09:46:31	_saracen	wow
2016-07-21 09:46:39	_saracen	I kind of assumed they were all the same thing
2016-07-21 09:46:41	keveloper	14 feet wtf
2016-07-21 09:46:49	_saracen	Damn ocean
2016-07-21 09:46:51	_saracen	You scary
2016-07-21 09:46:53	keveloper	That's like terrifying
2016-07-21 09:48:31	_saracen	The size of sharks and whales is so hard for me to comprehend
2016-07-21 09:49:05	_saracen	There have been 20 foot crocodiles and shit too
2016-07-21 09:51:29	keveloper	aren't blue whales like the size of a football field or something
2016-07-21 09:53:24	_saracen	32 Meters
2016-07-21 09:53:55	_saracen	Much longer than a lot of fishing boats. Longer than the Space Shuttle
2016-07-21 09:54:12	keveloper	That's scary
2016-07-21 09:54:26	keveloper	isn't there some huge jellyfish
2016-07-21 09:54:42	_saracen	Good thing they aren't macro carnivores
2016-07-21 09:54:48	keveloper	"had a bell with a diameter of 2.3 metres (7 ft 6 in) and tentacles 37.0 m (121.4 ft) long"
2016-07-21 09:55:11	_saracen	Giant Squid are massive and scary as fuuuck
2016-07-21 09:55:50	keveloper	43 feet

2016-08-16 09:59:49	keveloper	and i was like "wait what?" lol
2016-08-16 10:00:21	_saracen	Downside of Dan and Bill being out on the same day

2016-08-23 12:56:50	_saracen	Also, there are a lot of ship commercials which are fun to watch
2016-08-23 12:56:59	_saracen	Basically car commercials for the different ships being sold
2016-08-23 12:57:26	_saracen	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FF-ewiwmhs
2016-08-23 12:57:32	keveloper	Okay lol
2016-08-23 12:57:38	keveloper	this game is so interesting
2016-08-23 12:57:43	_saracen	Yeah, it is ridiculous
2016-08-23 12:58:05	_saracen	I don't know if I like Gary Oldman's voice in that video, but it is awesome to see that they Mo-capped him direactly into the game
2016-08-23 16:14:38	_saracen	Battlefields are fun on the computer. Red Orchestra 2 is one of my favorite shooters of all time. ARMA is battlefield-ish and realistic. There is one coming out called Squad that will be even more realistic and awesome. You should play AOE:3 which is great. Starcraft 2 is a great RTS. I don't know any racing games. Recently, Total War games have been a lot of fun for me, Rome II, Shogun II, Warhammer, 
2016-08-23 16:14:44	_saracen	and Empire: Total War
2016-08-23 16:15:08	keveloper	I've heard great things aboout ARMA
2016-08-23 16:15:12	keveloper	Total War is insane

2016-08-25 13:31:50	keveloper	so what are your thoughts on origin access
2016-08-25 13:31:55	keveloper	do yout think youre gonna do it?
2016-08-25 13:36:12	keveloper	I'm worried about playing a game for 3 months then EA removing it from the vault
2016-08-25 13:36:18	keveloper	But at that point the game might be cheap so
2016-08-25 14:48:21	_saracen	Sorry, was pairing with Silas
2016-08-25 14:56:34	_saracen	I could see it being worth it if you just wanted to play a game and are someone who doesn't often go back to old games
2016-08-25 14:56:45	_saracen	And if you play a game for a span of months and never go back, fuck it
2016-08-25 14:56:56	_saracen	They probably add new games every few months
2016-08-25 14:57:10	_saracen	A year costs as much as buying to new games
2016-08-25 14:59:12	keveloper	$60 a year?
2016-08-25 14:59:31	keveloper	Yeah im not sure... I'm thinking about it. I might do it for like two months
2016-08-25 14:59:34	keveloper	Are you gonna try it>?
2016-08-25 15:26:31	_saracen	Oh right
2016-08-25 15:26:34	_saracen	It's 5 a month
2016-08-25 15:26:37	_saracen	So that is one new game
2016-08-25 15:26:42	_saracen	I'll probably try it
2016-08-25 15:26:46	keveloper	same
2016-08-25 15:26:55	keveloper	if its really BF4 premium i think tahts a great deal
2016-08-25 15:26:57	_saracen	I have been letting my roommates use a second account on my computer to play stuff
2016-08-25 15:27:12	_saracen	So I may be able to get them to give me some money to to share that account as well
2016-08-25 15:27:16	_saracen	Then it is even cheaper
2016-08-25 15:33:16	_saracen	I might be able to play for an hour or something later if you are going to BF4
2016-08-25 15:34:13	keveloper	i am
2016-08-25 15:34:18	keveloper	if i can download all the shit i need lolol

2016-08-25 15:34:48	keveloper	and get my xbox controller wokring
2016-08-25 15:35:32	_saracen	Don't use a controller for a shooter
2016-08-25 15:35:40	_saracen	You are part of the PC Master Race now
2016-08-25 15:37:42	keveloper	but i've played BF for like 6 years with a controller
2016-08-25 15:37:45	keveloper	i like controllers :(
2016-08-25 15:37:58	keveloper	im gonna accidentally throws frags at you otherwise
2016-08-25 15:38:29	_saracen	I don't think there is autoaim in BF4 on computer
2016-08-25 15:39:41	_saracen	They might have a profile for controllers
2016-08-25 15:39:57	keveloper	you ready for the douchiest PC gamer thread ever
2016-08-25 15:39:58	keveloper	http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/forum/threadview/2955064771244160675/
2016-08-25 15:40:14	keveloper	nah I can play FPS without a controller lol

2016-08-25 15:40:56	_saracen	I make fun of controller people, but I'm not like.. amazing with a mouse
2016-08-25 15:41:02	_saracen	I'm just way worse with a controller
2016-08-25 15:41:36	_saracen	But controllers are much less accurate than mice
2016-08-25 15:41:46	keveloper	yeah
2016-08-25 15:41:53	keveloper	i just havent played a pc shooter in a long time
2016-08-25 15:41:59	_saracen	Yeah, you'll do fine
2016-08-25 15:42:22	keveloper	granted I can control mine craft fine
2016-08-25 15:42:35	keveloper	not that that requires incredible aim or anything
2016-08-25 15:43:16	_saracen	There are some things in that game that require some good, fast aiming
2016-08-25 15:44:29	keveloper	i'm sure i'll be fine lol
2016-08-25 15:44:35	keveloper	I might get a steam controller too
2016-08-25 15:45:04	keveloper	I wonder if I can use a headphones with a built in mic on any jack of my computer
2016-08-25 15:45:05	_saracen	Steam Controller would probably be adequate
2016-08-25 15:45:07	keveloper	_saracen do you know?
2016-08-25 15:45:08	_saracen	It is useful
2016-08-25 15:45:25	_saracen	Does it have two ports?
2016-08-25 15:45:29	_saracen	Jacks
2016-08-25 15:45:29	keveloper	No
2016-08-25 15:45:37	_saracen	I think you need a special jack for the mic to work too
2016-08-25 15:45:40	keveloper	Yeah
2016-08-25 15:45:47	keveloper	I doubt the case or MB has it
2016-08-25 15:46:45	keveloper	my lav mic is getting delivered tomorrow lol

2016-08-25 15:51:27	keveloper	never heard of it

2016-08-25 15:51:50	_saracen	Origin might have VOIP stuff
2016-08-25 15:52:17	keveloper	Discord looks from this century at least lol

2016-08-25 15:53:54	keveloper	My friend's gonna play with us too
2016-08-25 15:54:08	keveloper	We play conquest hardcore like exclusively, you?
2016-08-25 15:54:53	_saracen	I haven't played battlefield for a while lol
2016-08-25 15:54:58	_saracen	Is that just capture points?
2016-08-25 15:55:03	keveloper	yeah
2016-08-25 15:55:06	_saracen	As opposed to Rush?
2016-08-25 15:55:08	keveloper	yeah
2016-08-25 15:55:12	keveloper	conquest is classic BF
2016-08-25 15:55:17	_saracen	Yeah, I like that
2016-08-25 15:55:23	_saracen	I kind of enjoyed Rush in Bad Company 2
2016-08-25 15:55:41	keveloper	A B C D E F, capture the objectivs
2016-08-25 15:55:43	_saracen	BC2 would probably the last one I played 
2016-08-25 15:55:48	_saracen	seriously
2016-08-25 15:55:54	keveloper	Damn lol
2016-08-25 15:56:02	keveloper	We very seriously play BF3/BF4
2016-08-25 15:56:08	keveloper	BF3 is my favorite game of all time
2016-08-25 15:56:09	_saracen	That was like their Testbed for a new version of the engine 
2016-08-25 15:56:17	keveloper	yeah
2016-08-25 15:56:20	keveloper	i didnt love bad company
2016-08-25 15:56:32	keveloper	do remember how the points work?
2016-08-25 15:56:46	_saracen	I loved BC2 just because of those new features. The amazing sound design and the destructable environments
2016-08-25 15:56:49	_saracen	No
2016-08-25 15:56:55	keveloper	omg the sound design
2016-08-25 15:56:59	_saracen	Unless you mean they count down people's ticket's
2016-08-25 15:57:02	keveloper	BF4 is amazing in that aspect
2016-08-25 15:57:04	keveloper	yeah
2016-08-25 15:57:08	keveloper	how the counting works
2016-08-25 15:57:09	_saracen	Honestly, the sound design might be my favorite part of BF
2016-08-25 15:57:51	keveloper	if you have more control points than the other team your points stay the same and theirs goes down
2016-08-25 15:57:53	_saracen	Most other games give you info about the game with sound, but battlefield uses it to make the environments feel so freaking real
2016-08-25 15:57:55	keveloper	tied doesnt do anything
2016-08-25 15:58:00	keveloper	a spawn costs 1 ticket
2016-08-25 15:58:12	_saracen	Okay. So they haven't changed it since 1942
2016-08-25 15:58:37	keveloper	SO IF YOU ARE ON A TEAM AND YOU ARE LOSING 1-7 AND ARE COMING BACK IN THE LAST 30 SECONDS DO NOT SPAWN
2016-08-25 15:58:38	keveloper	fucking people
2016-08-25 15:58:40	keveloper	we get so mad
2016-08-25 15:58:51	keveloper	we just sit there screaming DONNTT SPAWNN I SWEAR TO GOD
2016-08-25 15:59:11	keveloper	most people dont know spawning costs a ticket, they think dying costs a ticket lol
2016-08-25 15:59:29	keveloper	so you are about to win a close match and some asshole on your team spawns and you lose 0-3
2016-08-25 16:00:38	_saracen	lol
2016-08-25 16:00:45	keveloper	i get very heated
2016-08-25 16:00:51	keveloper	people are dumb -_-
2016-08-25 16:00:54	_saracen	haha
2016-08-25 16:00:58	_saracen	I know that you have an intense side
2016-08-25 16:01:12	keveloper	i am in my element when playing BF4 lol
2016-08-25 16:01:15	keveloper	i might suck on PC though
2016-08-25 16:01:30	_saracen	You'll probably take a bit to get your hands adjusted
2016-08-25 16:01:31	keveloper	Im super good at flying helis with a controller so im curious about how i'll be with a mouse and keybaord
2016-08-25 16:01:50	_saracen	Flying is one place where Controllers are better
2016-08-25 16:02:00	_saracen	You can have both hooked up and use the controller for flying
2016-08-25 16:02:14	keveloper	im pumped to play lol
2016-08-25 16:02:38	_saracen	When do you guys think you will play?
2016-08-25 16:02:43	keveloper	no idea
2016-08-25 16:02:46	keveloper	let me ask him
2016-08-25 16:02:55	keveloper	might go steal a mic from my parents house
2016-08-25 16:03:08	keveloper	it is my mic after all lol
2016-08-25 16:03:16	keveloper	its a condenser though lol not exactly a gaming mic
2016-08-25 16:03:43	keveloper	have you played BF4?
2016-08-25 16:04:51	_saracen	I think for a few minutes lol

2016-08-25 16:05:19	_saracen	So I might not be total shit, but don't expect much haha
2016-08-25 16:05:25	keveloper	same
2016-08-25 16:05:28	keveloper	1942 was the shit
2016-08-25 16:05:33	keveloper	battlefield 2 was legendary lol

2016-08-25 16:06:12	keveloper	oooh nooo, i have to start over all my prgoression :(
2016-08-25 16:06:16	_saracen	I should have an hour or two
2016-08-25 16:06:19	_saracen	Yeah, that might suck
2016-08-25 16:06:19	_saracen	:(
2016-08-25 16:06:33	_saracen	I am going to go hard with BF1
2016-08-25 16:06:36	_saracen	I love WWI shit
2016-08-25 16:06:46	keveloper	idk how i feel about that one
2016-08-25 16:06:47	keveloper	we'll see
2016-08-25 16:07:02	keveloper	it looks cool but i dont love WWI
2016-08-25 16:08:25	_saracen	My other favorite shooter is a really realistic WWII shooter
2016-08-25 16:08:32	_saracen	Most of the guns are bolt actions and shit
2016-08-25 16:08:35	keveloper	lemme guess
2016-08-25 16:08:36	keveloper	uh
2016-08-25 16:08:54	keveloper	idk lol
2016-08-25 16:08:56	_saracen	Red Orchestra II
2016-08-25 16:08:59	keveloper	Oh!
2016-08-25 16:09:12	_saracen	If you are out in the open for too long you are dead
2016-08-25 16:09:13	keveloper	I think i played the first one a few times at my parents house
2016-08-25 16:09:18	_saracen	Also very good sound design
2016-08-25 16:09:30	keveloper	BF4 hardcore is like that
2016-08-25 16:09:32	keveloper	not on all maps but
2016-08-25 16:09:40	_saracen	No names over people's heads or anything either. Iron Sights are all you get
2016-08-25 16:09:49	keveloper	oh no lol
2016-08-25 16:09:53	keveloper	how many TKs are there
2016-08-25 16:10:00	_saracen	You know when a new player joins
2016-08-25 16:10:12	_saracen	You have to learn how the Russian's run vs the Germans
2016-08-25 16:10:19	keveloper	lol thats cool
2016-08-25 16:10:20	_saracen	Once you get that down, it is a lot easier
2016-08-25 16:10:37	keveloper	I forget how you tell the different in hardcore bf4
2016-08-25 16:10:43	_saracen	It apparently matches up with the training they got in WWII
2016-08-25 16:10:54	_saracen	Yeah, I wonder. Maybe just uniforms?
2016-08-25 16:11:09	keveloper	... wow i cant remember
2016-08-25 16:11:19	keveloper	oh! you have blue names over your teammates
2016-08-25 16:11:25	keveloper	that are in direct sight with you
2016-08-25 16:11:31	keveloper	so anything else just shoot it lol
2016-08-25 16:12:36	keveloper	so hardcore means no hud, (except the score and your teammates names and whether or not they are alive), you die faster, no 3rd person vehicle view
2016-08-25 16:12:44	keveloper	no minimap
2016-08-25 16:12:52	keveloper	no ammo/clip indicators
2016-08-25 16:12:56	_saracen	No 3rd on Vehicles would be hard
2016-08-25 16:13:04	_saracen	yeah, in RO2 there is a button to pull your mag and check
2016-08-25 16:13:05	keveloper	i only do 1st now because of that lol
2016-08-25 16:13:12	keveloper	oh thats cool
2016-08-25 16:13:18	keveloper	you cant even see your firing mode in BF4 hardcore
2016-08-25 16:13:21	_saracen	I think it says something in text
2016-08-25 16:13:25	_saracen	Haha, I like that
2016-08-25 16:13:29	_saracen	I'd probably be horrible at it
2016-08-25 16:13:48	keveloper	so i'll forget to switch it to full auto in close quarters and see someone and just be like "pop" and then they destory me as i realize i had it on single fire
2016-08-25 16:13:50	_saracen	What gun should I start leveling up
2016-08-25 16:13:56	_saracen	Aww
2016-08-25 16:13:57	_saracen	lol
2016-08-25 16:14:03	_saracen	Or class
2016-08-25 16:14:08	_saracen	However the progression works
2016-08-25 16:14:12	keveloper	I start with assult, can't remember the starting gun
2016-08-25 16:14:21	_saracen	AK101 or something
2016-08-25 16:14:35	keveloper	lol AK47 is super powerful and it is one of the later guns
2016-08-25 16:14:36	_saracen	Assault, Medic, Support, Engineer?
2016-08-25 16:14:47	keveloper	no medic doesn't exist anymore
2016-08-25 16:14:49	_saracen	Scout?
2016-08-25 16:14:50	_saracen	Aww
2016-08-25 16:14:50	keveloper	Recon
2016-08-25 16:14:51	keveloper	yeah
2016-08-25 16:14:54	keveloper	Assault is medic
2016-08-25 16:15:03	_saracen	Interesting
2016-08-25 16:15:07	keveloper	Assault you can carry health packs and defibs
2016-08-25 16:15:12	keveloper	but you only have two spots
2016-08-25 16:15:22	_saracen	Do they take the same slots as grenadte?
2016-08-25 16:15:30	keveloper	no
2016-08-25 16:15:34	keveloper	M320
2016-08-25 16:15:43	_saracen	TUUBES
2016-08-25 16:15:45	keveloper	Uhhh anyother gun addons
2016-08-25 16:15:45	keveloper	lolol
2016-08-25 16:15:58	keveloper	there's a bunch of different types of M320's its cool
2016-08-25 16:16:02	keveloper	M320 smoke is cool
2016-08-25 16:16:13	keveloper	M320 darts are weird (its an instant kill I think)
2016-08-25 16:16:26	keveloper	sniping in hard core is fun beacause its like one shot kill everything
2016-08-25 16:16:27	_saracen	Like flechettes?
2016-08-25 16:16:39	keveloper	idk
2016-08-25 16:16:48	keveloper	http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/40mm_Dart
2016-08-25 16:17:09	keveloper	uh yeah
2016-08-25 16:17:15	keveloper	flechette
2016-08-25 16:17:29	_saracen	They used them in shotguns in Vietnam
2016-08-25 16:17:44	keveloper	my favorite all time gun was the AN-94
2016-08-25 16:17:50	keveloper	it was like a fucking sniper assault rifle
2016-08-25 16:18:02	keveloper	i could literally kill snipers trying to snipe me with it on burst
2016-08-25 16:18:08	keveloper	from a long range
2016-08-25 16:18:14	_saracen	The 2 shot burst
2016-08-25 16:18:17	keveloper	it was incredible, but they nerfed it in BF4
2016-08-25 16:18:18	keveloper	yeah
2016-08-25 16:18:20	_saracen	Aww
2016-08-25 16:18:23	_saracen	It is an awesome gun
2016-08-25 16:18:25	keveloper	I think 2 shot burst, cant remember
2016-08-25 16:18:31	_saracen	The real one is 2 shot
2016-08-25 16:18:31	keveloper	but yeah i fucking loved that AN94
2016-08-25 16:18:37	keveloper	2 shot sounds familiar
2016-08-25 16:18:41	keveloper	that was one of the reasons i loved it
2016-08-25 16:18:47	_saracen	It has a delay system that basically shoots twice before the gun recoils
2016-08-25 16:18:50	keveloper	a new thing I like are the 2x FLIR scopes
2016-08-25 16:19:01	_saracen	Ooh
2016-08-25 16:19:04	keveloper	you can see enemies like instantly its incredible
2016-08-25 16:19:15	keveloper	much better than the IRNV if you every used those in BF
2016-08-25 16:19:53	keveloper	alright well im gonna head out and go start installing this hahaha

2017-07-21 10:44:41	keveloper	woah
2017-07-21 10:44:52	keveloper	that's fancy
2017-07-21 10:44:58	keveloper	the 2 burst mechanism hammer thing
2017-07-21 10:45:09	keveloper	that's so cool
2017-07-21 10:45:42	_saracen	Yeah. You'd probably like that channel
2017-07-21 10:45:54	_saracen	Did the magazine angle off to the side in BF3?
2017-07-21 10:48:23	keveloper	no it was straight down iirc why
2017-07-21 10:48:56	_saracen	The real one's magazine angles off to the right
2017-07-21 10:49:11	keveloper	http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/AN-94#Battlefield_3
2017-07-21 10:49:27	keveloper	like how far
2017-07-21 10:50:46	keveloper	it looks like it might a little but i dont think i ever saw the right side of the gun
2017-07-21 10:50:49	_saracen	It looks like they have it right in BF4
2017-07-21 10:51:06	_saracen	http://i.imgur.com/EqpN4LO.jpg
2017-07-21 10:51:24	keveloper	waat why
2017-07-21 10:51:42	_saracen	For 2 shot burst
2017-07-21 10:52:24	_saracen	It has to actually load to rounds from the magazine each time the trigger is pulled because the second shot shoots before the bolt could actually go back to grab a second round from the magazine
2017-07-21 10:52:32	_saracen	So it needs space to load a second round
2017-07-21 10:52:48	keveloper	that's so weird
2017-07-21 10:52:56	_saracen	It is an insane design
2017-07-21 10:52:59	_saracen	really cool
