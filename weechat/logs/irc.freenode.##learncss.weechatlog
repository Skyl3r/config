2017-09-25 14:15:43	MassDebates	Oi innovati
2017-09-25 14:15:48	MassDebates	I think you should check this out
2017-09-25 14:16:08	MassDebates	https://www.visme.co/
2017-09-25 14:16:10	MassDebates	Pretty neat.
2017-09-25 14:16:13	MassDebates	Considering using it.
2017-09-25 14:24:38	MassDebates	looks slick compared to your average slideshow
2017-09-25 14:24:51	MassDebates	but I think this can be done by the skilled front end dev
2017-09-25 14:25:26	MassDebates	You should check it out. I would bet that EQCSS could provide value to the creation of such a presentation
2017-09-25 14:25:53	MassDebates	Drastically simplify (and speed up) the process.
2017-09-25 14:31:04	innovati_	ah interesting
2017-09-25 14:32:35	innovati_	so they seem to have HTML-based slideshows, and SVG-based illustrations
2017-09-25 14:32:47	innovati_	'presentation' and 'infographic'
2017-09-25 14:33:31	innovati_	I guess they'd be competing with people like icloud.com
2017-09-25 14:46:19	MassDebates	Probably.
2017-09-25 14:46:32	MassDebates	But definitely a new player to the mix, with some interesting changes to the way they do things
2017-09-25 14:47:11	MassDebates	Also, this is a bit more of a specific niche. If I'm not mistaken, you're referring to the personal presentations that apple offers
2017-09-25 14:47:42	MassDebates	This seems to be geared towards presentations specifically. I don't like a lot of the faux-pas that these guys seem to commit, though.
2017-09-25 14:48:02	MassDebates	For example, there's some awful performance issues that are damned-near prohibitive for usage.
2017-09-25 14:48:15	MassDebates	Also, embeddable content is horrid.
2017-09-25 14:48:26	MassDebates	Well, full disclosure. I haven't actually... used or tried this out yet.
2017-09-25 14:48:58	MassDebates	But going over the code and CSS gives me the willies on this project. Lots of awful things going on.
2017-09-25 14:49:08	MassDebates	Backgrounds, for example.
2017-09-25 14:50:13	MassDebates	Honestly a far simpler system could go much further imo
2017-09-25 14:50:30	MassDebates	I'll be trying it out soon. These are my premonitions though. i could be totally wrong on all of my assumptions of how it will fare.
2017-09-25 14:51:04	MassDebates	I have to commend these guys for using their product to market ... their product.'
2017-09-25 14:51:12	MassDebates	er, really, _how_ they're doing it.
2017-09-25 14:52:25	innovati_	hehe yeah, I think there's a lot of potential in this space and we're likely to see a lot more design + web tools in the future
2017-09-25 14:53:02	innovati_	especially with SVG - I hope the future brings SVG performance enhancements to browsers so we can get more out of them
2017-09-25 14:53:55	MassDebates	No need to worry, or even hope
2017-09-25 14:54:08	MassDebates	They will, unless if something even better than SVG ends up coming to mainstream
2017-09-25 14:54:19	innovati_	with design tools that use web standard files as their native format - all of the editor-specific code can be added as metadata, comments, and attributes - so it should be possible for us to standardize editing info and have web-native files that can be opened and edited in more than one tool
2017-09-25 14:54:41	innovati_	that's always been possible, but competitive between businesses instead of open and encouraging collaboration
2017-09-25 14:54:55	MassDebates	#wordpress is recommending bootstrap 3
2017-09-25 14:54:59	MassDebates	What world do we live in

2017-09-26 11:38:49	audiofile	hi MassDebates
2017-09-26 11:39:04	MassDebates	Which bottom padding is a bit larger than what
2017-09-26 11:39:05	audiofile	Just elementary css and I'm stuck lol
2017-09-26 11:39:09	MassDebates	ah!
2017-09-26 11:39:11	MassDebates	Super duper!
2017-09-26 11:39:21	MassDebates	Shit I'm a bit rusty here
2017-09-26 11:39:22	audiofile	img's bottom padding is bigger than right padding even though both are 1em

2017-09-26 11:39:33	MassDebates	Ahem, Welcome to ##LearnCSS !
2017-09-26 11:39:40	MassDebates	The awesome channel about uh, whatever
2017-09-26 11:39:42	MassDebates	looking now
2017-09-26 11:39:45	audiofile	XD
2017-09-26 11:40:06	MassDebates	you mean margin?
2017-09-26 11:40:24	MassDebates	Just yesterday a student of mine called me about paddings and margin
2017-09-26 11:40:29	MassDebates	here's a good way to think about it
2017-09-26 11:40:35	MassDebates	Padding is a winter coat you wear. Padding.
2017-09-26 11:40:56	MassDebates	Margin is your safety bubble. Y'know, that feeling of discomfort that wipes over you when a creepy guy gets too close and he happens to be holding a rusty knife.
2017-09-26 11:41:05	MassDebates	Well, I suppose you'd need quite a big margin then!
2017-09-26 11:41:20	audiofile	ahh
2017-09-26 11:41:21	MassDebates	Here's the thing. Winter coats won't get magically 'ghosty-like' and start intersecting other winter coats, you see?
2017-09-26 11:41:35	MassDebates	However, your comfort zone can be the same as my comfort zone because you're not in my comfort zone. just your comfort zone is.
2017-09-26 11:41:36	MassDebates	y'see?
2017-09-26 11:41:45	MassDebates	Margins collapse, paddings stay (for the most part)
2017-09-26 11:41:48	MassDebates	Now, that being said
2017-09-26 11:41:55	MassDebates	your img here has a winter coat and a comfort zone.
2017-09-26 11:42:08	audiofile	uh, just a winter coat
2017-09-26 11:42:19	audiofile	I didn't add a margin/comfort zone :P
2017-09-26 11:42:21	MassDebates	Ah
2017-09-26 11:42:29	MassDebates	okay hold on let me use inspect
2017-09-26 11:42:36	MassDebates	My fault. (been a hwile since I helped people diagnose stuff)
2017-09-26 11:42:43	MassDebates	2 secs
2017-09-26 11:42:51	audiofile	no hurry :)
2017-09-26 11:42:55	MassDebates	Ah
2017-09-26 11:43:00	MassDebates	I see the issue.
2017-09-26 11:43:34	audiofile	Oh, what's that?
2017-09-26 11:43:45	audiofile	And btw, I don't understand how an img can have a wintercoat
2017-09-26 11:43:50	audiofile	I'd get it if it were a div
2017-09-26 11:44:08	MassDebates	okay, so couple things
2017-09-26 11:44:12	MassDebates	let me change the codepen to show you
2017-09-26 11:44:19	audiofile	sure

2017-09-26 11:45:35	MassDebates	haha
2017-09-26 11:45:39	MassDebates	okay, so here's the dealio.
2017-09-26 11:45:43	MassDebates	Look at the comment.
2017-09-26 11:45:48	MassDebates	What I also want you to do
2017-09-26 11:45:51	MassDebates	is to right click the image, hit inspect
2017-09-26 11:45:55	MassDebates	and then right click the image again
2017-09-26 11:45:59	MassDebates	and hit inspect for the 2nd round
2017-09-26 11:46:03	MassDebates	And you'll get some glowy blue shit
2017-09-26 11:46:13	MassDebates	The glowy blue shit shows you the box model's bounds. The green stuff is the winter coat.

2017-09-26 11:51:58	MassDebates	Well murdering people is usually not common best practices.

2017-09-26 11:59:01	audiofile	Yeah, it seems fine, the padding
2017-09-26 11:59:07	MassDebates	and it'll notch into place if it has enough room. it'll look like extra space if there's just a tiny bit too little

2017-09-27 16:39:23	atroclize1	ive got some html that is like <ul class="nav navbar-nav"><li><a>stuff</a></li></ul> how can i change the color of the 'a' tag?
2017-09-27 16:43:54	innovati_	atroclize1 maybe you can target it with a rule like a {}, or li a {}, or .nav a {}, or something like that
2017-09-27 16:45:07	innovati_	if you want only the <a> inside an <li> inside a ul with the class of both "nav" and "navbar-nav" you could express that as ul.nav.navbar-nav li a {} which should absolutely do this but it is probably be overkill to write it that specifically
2017-09-27 16:45:22	atroclize1	I created a <style>a { color: #00ff00; } </style> but that gets overridden I guess?
2017-09-27 16:45:54	innovati_	yeah, and that will target every <a> on the page too, which might be too broad
2017-09-27 16:46:15	atroclize1	But that didn't work at all
2017-09-27 16:46:23	innovati_	.nav a {} would target just the <a> that are inside any element with a class of "nav"
2017-09-27 16:46:34	innovati_	it's possible there's a more specific rule applying to all <a> already
2017-09-27 16:47:01	innovati_	like if they are all set as html a {} that still includes all of them, but html a {} is more specific than a {} so it would overwrite it every time
2017-09-27 16:47:36	innovati_	or maybe there's another rule for a {} getting loaded after the one you're editing - if one came after your rule with the same specificity it would overwrite the previously set value too
2017-09-27 16:48:43	atroclize1	Okay cool I think I've got it now, thanks my head was gonna explode haha

2017-09-28 10:48:55	innovati_	I feel like the hiccups is a metaphor for challenges in relocation?
2017-09-28 10:49:50	thykka	right
2017-09-28 10:50:36	thykka	afaik this is about UK leaving EU and the European Medical Agency needing a new HQ
2017-09-28 10:51:01	innovati_	nice
2017-09-28 10:51:27	innovati_	well now that it's launched I'm certain the content will arrive soon
2017-09-28 10:51:30	innovati_	:)
2017-09-28 10:51:49	thykka	i hope this is all the content there'll ever be on this site :D
2017-09-28 10:54:55	innovati_	:D

2017-09-28 11:31:14	innovati_	there's a guy writing an article about element queries and he just can't seem to wrap his head around scoping the application of a conditional style to only those elements that match is
2017-09-28 11:31:17	innovati_	*it
2017-09-28 11:32:37	audiophile	lol
2017-09-28 11:32:41	audiophile	link?
2017-09-28 11:32:59	audiophile	btw, is our seo friend safe?
2017-09-28 11:34:11	innovati_	hehe I hope so
2017-09-28 11:34:27	innovati_	time to hire bodyguards and make BFFs out of your old business partners
2017-09-28 11:34:29	audiophile	MassDebates ping for your safety :P
2017-09-28 11:34:37	audiophile	hehe
2017-09-28 11:34:51	audiophile	Looks like a real dangerous field
2017-09-28 11:35:44	innovati_	indeed :3
2017-09-28 11:37:13	innovati_	I'm just checking my own search ranking
2017-09-28 11:37:15	audiophile	soo, anyway, lazy me just slaps on a light blue gradient and site looks cooler now
2017-09-28 11:37:18	innovati_	I've moved up :D
2017-09-28 11:37:22	innovati_	nice!
2017-09-28 11:37:23	audiophile	how do you check that?
2017-09-28 11:37:27	innovati_	gradients can add a lot
2017-09-28 11:37:50	thykka	gradients are the cat's nightwear
2017-09-28 11:38:04	innovati_	audiophile Google results are based on like, 50 environmental variables, one of which is where I'm searching from, and another is what people near me search, so the results change as I move around town even - it's not exact
2017-09-28 11:38:07	thykka	and by that i mean they are the bee's leg joints
2017-09-28 11:38:29	audiophile	whoa, seo sounds...complicated?
2017-09-28 11:38:31	innovati_	but from my home, from incognito window (google pretends to not know it's still me) I was showing up low on the first page for 2 terms, and on page 4 for two other terms.
2017-09-28 11:38:55	innovati_	Now I'm nearer the top (like #2 spot) for those two good searches, and I'm at the bottom of page 3 for my other 2
2017-09-28 11:39:03	audiophile	wow
2017-09-28 11:39:08	audiophile	did you do something to cause that bump?
2017-09-28 11:39:18	innovati_	all I did was make a tiny bit of HTML, mark it up well add meta keywords and description, and that's about it
2017-09-28 11:39:38	innovati_	I switched from my old web server to hosting on Amazon S3, but I don't know if that helped, or if it just got more relevant over time
2017-09-28 11:39:59	thykka	that's a nice search rank, but do you have an IMDB page? :>
2017-09-28 11:40:06	innovati_	at first I put my resume online as HTML and never even linked it to anywhere, no link from my website - nothing and google still found it, ranked it, and it was doing well
2017-09-28 11:40:25	audiophile	imdb?
2017-09-28 11:40:26	thykka	(i just noticed that i have an IMDb page)
2017-09-28 11:40:27	innovati_	thykka no, but I have a TechCrunch bio :D
2017-09-28 11:40:29	audiophile	isn't that for movies?
2017-09-28 11:40:32	thykka	yes
2017-09-28 11:40:34	innovati_	crunchbase?
2017-09-28 11:40:38	audiophile	0_0
2017-09-28 11:40:45	audiophile	innovati_ makes movies?
2017-09-28 11:40:57	thykka	i'm listed under "Miscellaneous Crew"
2017-09-28 11:41:04	innovati_	no, I did that startup thing one time https://www.crunchbase.com/person/tommy-hodgins
2017-09-28 11:41:19	innovati_	thykka oh niiiiiice
2017-09-28 11:42:24	innovati_	what happens if you google 'Toronto UI Design Resume'? does any link to tomhodgins.com/resume.html show up?
2017-09-28 11:42:46	thykka	you're 4th
2017-09-28 11:42:47	audiophile	third link
2017-09-28 11:42:55	innovati_	that's the page - took like 30 minutes one day to write the content, 30 minutes another day to style it, and I don't link to it from anywhere
2017-09-28 11:42:59	innovati_	so google somehow just found that I had a /resume.html and ranked it accordingly
2017-09-28 11:43:06	innovati_	no further magic involved
2017-09-28 11:43:06	thykka	https://snag.gy/QSr5PC.jpg
2017-09-28 11:43:22	innovati_	yeah! for me it's one position above that, so surprising that you see it so high
2017-09-28 11:43:36	innovati_	I thought it would be more weighted to geographic location (where I'm searching from)
2017-09-28 11:43:48	audiophile	hmm third link here
2017-09-28 11:43:57	audiophile	I didn't get the third result that thykka got
2017-09-28 11:44:57	innovati_	so what I've learned from this experiment - take an hour to put your resume online and then forget about it
2017-09-28 11:45:25	innovati_	set it & forget it, but take the time sooner than later so you can start getting the ranking sooner

2017-09-28 14:15:01	innovati_	:)
2017-09-28 14:15:30	innovati_	everybody seems to be having the same problem with EQCSS, and everybody's solution seems to be "modify the plugin so no error occurs"
2017-09-28 14:15:42	innovati_	but the plugin is responding in error because something is wrong
2017-09-28 14:16:09	innovati_	if I 'fix' the plugin, it won't cause errors on broken pages where something is wrong. That doesn't seem like a solution to me, that feels like ignoring the problem, no?
2017-09-28 14:28:32	darkSeid_	hmmm
2017-09-28 14:28:41	darkSeid_	whats the issue
2017-09-28 14:28:54	darkSeid_	u dont want to be sich a
2017-09-28 14:29:08	darkSeid_	*such a purist that you create the perfect product that no one can/does use
2017-09-28 14:32:11	innovati_	You write EQCSS-formatted queries. The EQCSS.js plugin loads those. If at some point after EQCSS.js has loaded your queries - something magical on the page causes data to go missing from the EQCSS.data object where the parsed queries live…then the plugin has a hard time replacing the text of text that USED to exist, but for some reason no longer exists
2017-09-28 14:32:28	innovati_	you might think: well is it poorly formatted queries? Nope, we can verify the syntax is valid 2 ways
2017-09-28 14:32:56	innovati_	you might think: are those queries for some reason not getting loaded in correctly? Nope, we can verify that no matter how you supply the queries, the EQCSS.js plugin does load them 💯% at first
2017-09-28 14:33:18	innovati_	and when you create an empty test case where just your queries and EQCSS.js run without any of the other JS on the site…it isn't broken
2017-09-28 14:33:41	innovati_	but, when you load those queries, with EQCSS.js, and run them over time on a page with ¿something else?, some data is getting dropped and the error occurs
2017-09-28 14:33:59	innovati_	right now 50% of the Pull Requests to EQCSS on Github are ways of ignoring the fact that styles have gone missing when they go missing
2017-09-28 14:34:26	innovati_	in reality, it's indicative of something else going wrong on the site. If it's deleting your stylesheets ignoring the fact that it's deleting them isn't a solution, you're still missing styles - now you just don't know it
2017-09-28 14:34:55	innovati_	(when it throws these errors it's still processing the rest, just letting you know: hey, the style data is now missing here)
2017-09-28 14:35:55	innovati_	I'd LOVE to track it down and figure out what's happening here, but the fact that I can't reproduce it except on full websites people are building, we can't even seem to replicate it with a smaller striped down test case says to me it's not a browser or OS thing, and not an EQCSS.js thing, but a 'their entire website' thing
2017-09-28 15:56:30	darkSeid_	hmmm
2017-09-28 15:56:51	darkSeid_	honestly, if you want people to use it, you either need an ugly fix or you need to spend real time finding out what's causing the issue and then determine the best path forward
2017-09-28 15:56:57	darkSeid_	otherwise its not gonna grow
2017-09-28 15:58:21	darkSeid_	innovati_ ^
2017-09-28 15:59:01	innovati_	yeah, I spent a few hours with the first person who reported the bug and we didn't nail it down, but he's using a custom build of EQCSS that has just what his project needs
2017-09-28 15:59:32	innovati_	in this case, I can't hope to track down what's causing it if they can't a) share their site where the problem pops up, and b) show me the queries they're trying to load in so we can try to build a stripped down test case that reproduces it
2017-09-28 15:59:51	darkSeid_	hmm
2017-09-28 16:00:04	-->	atroclize1 (~atroclize@134.49.239.121) has joined ##learncss
2017-09-28 16:00:09	darkSeid_	well yeah, if they cant give you the necessary information to debug, then obviously you cant debug
2017-09-28 16:00:21	darkSeid_	do you have any ideas as to what it could be
2017-09-28 16:00:38	innovati_	but making the plugin so NOBODY could debug the problem by hiding when it occurs isn't a step forward for me who wants to be able to fix the real problem going on
2017-09-28 16:00:54	innovati_	on the site where I saw it it was intermittent, and not always the same queries
2017-09-28 16:01:13	innovati_	we could verify the queries were good, they worked in isolation of the rest of his JS, it was broken only on the full site, but in whatever browser you tried
2017-09-28 16:01:26	innovati_	and it wasn't consistent. You could reload it 4 times and no problem, 1 dropped, then 4 dropped, then fine again
2017-09-28 16:01:29	innovati_	so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-09-28 16:02:14	darkSeid_	hmm
2017-09-28 16:02:33	darkSeid_	then it'll be one of his JS files he's loading async i guess?
2017-09-28 16:02:48	darkSeid_	something that if it loads before X it's fine, but after X and it's fucked
2017-09-28 16:02:54	darkSeid_	possibly?
2017-09-28 16:03:22	innovati_	I have no clue why something would be accessing something like EQCSS.data[0].style and somehow nullifying it though
2017-09-28 16:03:29	darkSeid_	well
2017-09-28 16:03:31	darkSeid_	it wont be?
2017-09-28 16:03:34	innovati_	it's so specific, what would accidentally touch that?
2017-09-28 16:03:35	darkSeid_	it wont be that direct
2017-09-28 16:03:45	darkSeid_	it'll be grabbing something more generic
2017-09-28 16:03:57	innovati_	well we can see they go missing
2017-09-28 16:04:05	innovati_	the object is there but style is empty…sometimes
2017-09-28 16:04:13	innovati_	after it has been there originally
2017-09-28 16:04:21	darkSeid_	could it be something crazy like maxymizer or smth
2017-09-28 16:04:54	innovati_	this is the 'broken' site I know about - but it didn't seem broken at all today https://www.focusvitamins.com/?template=fvs
2017-09-28 16:05:05	darkSeid_	what is supposed to be broken
2017-09-28 16:05:13	innovati_	if you run this in the console and there are 'broken' styles, it will return the queries in the console
2017-09-28 16:05:14	innovati_	EQCSS.data.forEach(query => { if (!query.style) console.log(query) })
2017-09-28 16:05:21	innovati_	doesn't seem to be doing it right now / today
2017-09-28 16:05:30	innovati_	he hasn't told me he fixed it, but he did say it was intermittent
2017-09-28 16:05:47	darkSeid_	man
2017-09-28 16:05:52	innovati_	I see neither errors, nor does running this log queries that are broken
2017-09-28 16:05:57	darkSeid_	thats a lot of shit getting loaded in the console though
2017-09-28 16:06:02	innovati_	hooooo yeah
2017-09-28 16:06:19	innovati_	this site has a TON of JS
2017-09-28 16:06:20	darkSeid_	is that just lazy console logging?
2017-09-28 16:06:35	innovati_	it's a development site
2017-09-28 16:07:16	innovati_	although a version that looks similar to this seems to be on the live site now too - maybe they finally launched it :D
2017-09-28 16:07:55	darkSeid_	hmm
2017-09-28 16:08:05	darkSeid_	unless you have full access its basically impossible to debug
2017-09-28 16:08:09	innovati_	yeah
2017-09-28 16:08:30	darkSeid_	have you asked him what 3rd party stuff he's using
2017-09-28 16:08:56	innovati_	so 'to make IE happy' one user wants me to add this to EQCSS.js https://github.com/eqcss/eqcss/pull/76/commits/6d41e6c55b7d398ba031a0c5e7bb5515abc7e158
2017-09-28 16:09:33	innovati_	this forces `code` in this situation to always be a string type, even if `code` is undefined. This stops the error, but your site is still missing a style, you've just tricked the plugin into thinking it processed the style
2017-09-28 16:09:49	darkSeid_	hmm
2017-09-28 16:10:01	innovati_	A different person has a different solution to the same problem - just check to see if it's defined before attempting to process it: https://github.com/eqcss/eqcss/pull/71/commits/fa22f5cb4f4f83dc8b6f9e9e693ea36bec0ac22d
2017-09-28 16:10:08	darkSeid_	i feel a conditional might be better there
2017-09-28 16:10:17	darkSeid_	yeah
2017-09-28 16:10:21	darkSeid_	thats what i would have thought
2017-09-28 16:10:22	innovati_	that way the plugin will skip it if it's broken! problem solved, now it doesn't matter that your site is broken and the stylesheet is missing, you'll never even know
2017-09-28 16:11:22	darkSeid_	good point :
2017-09-28 16:11:23	darkSeid_	:p
2017-09-28 16:11:49	innovati_	by having an error when the code that's loaded has been broken that leads you to believe maybe a style is missing, and when you check - it IS…isn't that a helpful debugging thing?
2017-09-28 16:11:57	darkSeid_	absolutely
2017-09-28 16:12:03	darkSeid_	massively
2017-09-28 16:12:23	innovati_	I would never have thought to run the console thing checking for styles that got broken if there hadn't been an error. they may or may not have noticed the style was missing visually, but how would you even begin to troubleshoot
2017-09-28 16:12:47	darkSeid_	for sure
2017-09-28 16:12:55	darkSeid_	errors are helpful :)
2017-09-28 16:13:09	innovati_	actually I just asked him now, the site I linked to - and he said there never was a visual problem he ever saw, there was just an annoying message in the console. I don't believe that, if the style was missing it's gone so _something_ must have been off visually, but clearly it wasn't too important
2017-09-28 16:13:23	innovati_	so who knows if it will pop up intermittently again ;)
2017-09-28 16:13:29	darkSeid_	i had an issue today where something wasn't working and without the error message i would have been totally screwed
2017-09-28 16:14:31	darkSeid_	could be a style thats only applied on mobile and he  was looking at desktop maybe
2017-09-28 16:16:22	innovati_	yeah, he has the highest number of queries I've ever seen on a site so when he drops 1 or 2 out of hundreds, it's hard to check
2017-09-28 16:17:10	innovati_	in some cases it looked like he even had redundancy between queries so it's possible when one or 2 fail only some properties were missing too. I thought it was messy code but maybe it was extreme foresight hehe
2017-09-28 16:18:30	darkSeid_	that sounds fucking horrendous to try and debug
2017-09-28 16:18:32	darkSeid_	for a site that small
2017-09-28 16:18:59	innovati_	yeah, people love making things more complex than they need to be just because of the beauty of the system to them
2017-09-28 16:19:40	darkSeid_	yep
2017-09-28 16:19:51	darkSeid_	altho tbh our site is a fucking monster
2017-09-28 16:19:59	darkSeid_	which is what happens when a company grows fast
2017-09-28 16:20:30	darkSeid_	its revenue is nearly 1bn dollars a year but they only started like 16 yrs ago and its all online
2017-09-28 16:20:33	innovati_	the site I spend a lot of time working on grew horizontally a lot and suffers with some structural issues
2017-09-28 16:20:54	innovati_	but that was a conscious choice made by project management about how things would be expanded, so it's exactly what they asked for
2017-09-28 16:21:04	innovati_	that's a lot of revenue!! :3
2017-09-28 16:21:14	innovati_	16 years is an eternity to be online too
2017-09-28 16:21:23	innovati_	that's really good
2017-09-28 16:22:57	darkSeid_	yeah
2017-09-28 16:23:06	darkSeid_	but i means its very tough to keep managing it all
2017-09-28 16:23:17	innovati_	I'm sure
2017-09-28 16:23:18	darkSeid_	because the front end team is still relatively small
2017-09-28 16:23:22	darkSeid_	like, maybe...
2017-09-28 16:23:37	innovati_	it sounds exciting
2017-09-28 16:23:53	darkSeid_	12-14 devs total?
2017-09-28 16:24:00	innovati_	doing that store
2017-09-28 16:24:01	innovati_	yeah
2017-09-28 16:24:13	darkSeid_	ehh, some of the work is awesome, some of it is soul crushing man
2017-09-28 16:24:30	darkSeid_	like updating some merchanise pods on the site
2017-09-28 16:24:49	darkSeid_	its literally copying urls and image names and going into Sitecore and pasting it in
2017-09-28 16:24:57	darkSeid_	and it can take days
2017-09-28 16:25:32	darkSeid_	but some of the work is really cool and challenging
2017-09-28 16:25:49	darkSeid_	and it reminds me how much of a fookin n00b i still am :p
2017-09-28 16:26:30	darkSeid_	and ive got an awesome project next week. its a page i need to build but its gonna be very tricky
2017-09-28 16:27:39	innovati_	is there a way you could build something on your end to automate some of that?
2017-09-28 16:27:58	innovati_	I was looking at Mac automator the other day wondering if there was a way I could use that to tie together some desktop apps into a workflow
2017-09-28 16:34:09	<--	atroclize1 (~atroclize@134.49.239.121) has quit (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
2017-09-28 16:34:22	darkSeid_	yes
2017-09-28 16:34:30	darkSeid_	absolutely
2017-09-28 16:34:32	darkSeid_	well, its what we are going to try and look at
2017-09-28 16:34:38	darkSeid_	although tbh it shouldnt be a dev job at all
2017-09-28 16:38:21	darkSeid_	its just risky to automate tbh

2017-09-28 16:39:46	innovati_	yeah
2017-09-28 16:45:41	darkSeid_	egh
2017-09-28 16:45:54	darkSeid_	im having one of those weeks where i feel like i know nothing
2017-09-28 16:45:59	darkSeid_	after 7 months :/
2017-09-28 16:45:59	innovati_	*hug*
2017-09-28 16:46:12	darkSeid_	\o/
2017-09-28 16:46:18	innovati_	it means you're growing
2017-09-28 16:46:19	darkSeid_	it worked, muahaha
2017-09-28 16:46:23	darkSeid_	;)
2017-09-28 16:46:54	darkSeid_	man  i dont feel like it sometimes tho
2017-09-28 16:47:09	darkSeid_	sometimes i just think 'i have no idea wtf is going on'
2017-09-28 16:47:58	innovati_	everybody has those moments unless you're dead!

2017-09-28 16:52:48	darkSeid_	yeah but for me its actually true :p
2017-09-28 16:52:59	darkSeid_	do you ever go through moments where u feel less motivated?
2017-09-28 16:56:10	innovati_	yes!
2017-09-28 16:56:18	innovati_	I just flipped a ticket last night that was killing me!
2017-09-28 16:56:57	innovati_	stuff I CAN do, but don't like to do
2017-09-28 16:58:44	darkSeid_	right
2017-09-28 16:59:08	darkSeid_	but i mean do u ever just feel a little tired of coding, like you need a break/holiday/whatever
2017-09-28 16:59:25	innovati_	I was taking a whole bunch of charts like this image and vectorizing the data and recreating them at a much larger resolution so the slides could be used as video overlays: https://imgur.com/a/I5TXr
2017-09-28 16:59:44	innovati_	re: coding, yes and no
2017-09-28 17:00:20	innovati_	There were times when my job was to type hundreds of lines of CSS all day every day, it was honestly just a never-ending set of CSS that needed to be written and I grew weary of the labour
2017-09-28 17:00:37	darkSeid_	right
2017-09-28 17:00:54	innovati_	I've fought with JS until my brain hurt before too - and it wasn't because I was writing lots of code (not exhaustion from typing) just struggling to wrap my head around stuff
2017-09-28 17:01:31	innovati_	and I was one of the best HTML un-knotters at all of the places I've worked so I was always given the tangled up messes to try to sort out, couldn't always do it, so I know how mind-numbing hand-balancing broken HTML tags can be too
2017-09-28 17:01:54	innovati_	but despite all those moments I can remember, I still end up writing code to relax and have fun too - just very different code
2017-09-28 17:02:03	innovati_	so I know at worst it comes and goes
2017-09-28 17:04:54	innovati_	what do you find inspires or recharges you?
2017-09-28 17:26:45	darkSeid_	hmmm
2017-09-28 17:26:48	darkSeid_	good question!
2017-09-28 17:27:16	darkSeid_	i like being given challenges/problems to solve
2017-09-28 17:27:38	darkSeid_	something i can sink my teeth into
2017-09-28 17:27:52	darkSeid_	what recharges me is probably a few days of holiday :p
2017-09-28 17:29:18	innovati_	:D maybe make a big deal about relaxing on the weekends to help recover from the demands of the work wee
2017-09-28 17:29:37	innovati_	have a number of mini vacations that can add up to one vacation if put together
2017-09-28 17:36:37	darkSeid_	yeah good idea
2017-09-28 17:36:54	darkSeid_	i think also, there's so much for me to learn that sometimes it feels overwhelming
2017-09-28 17:37:02	darkSeid_	whereas if i didnt feel like that, it would probably not be so bad
2017-09-28 17:37:39	darkSeid_	its like starting a huge project, the most difficult thing about it is trying to destructure every task to its own component

2017-09-29 08:56:36	MassDebates	bad days
2017-09-29 08:56:38	MassDebates	bad days all around
2017-09-29 08:59:10	MassDebates	Good news is that my students are doing really good
2017-09-29 08:59:23	MassDebates	bad news is everything else
2017-09-29 09:01:21	MassDebates	we have a dedicated ip and it looks like spam has been going out under my nose
2017-09-29 09:01:33	MassDebates	enthusiastic sales reps. ugh.
2017-09-29 09:01:58	MassDebates	I gotta say though, really nice usage of our templates
2017-09-29 09:02:06	innovati_	good morning sir
2017-09-29 09:02:10	MassDebates	But that doesn't hurt our efforts to avoid blacklisting
2017-09-29 09:02:14	MassDebates	Good morning.
2017-09-29 09:02:52	thykka	cheer up, you're a clump of stardust drifting at 100000km/h around an ancient explosion.
2017-09-29 09:03:06	thykka	:>
2017-09-29 09:03:18	MassDebates	That's a theory.
2017-09-29 09:04:10	thykka	also, you work with stones with lightning inside of them, which we managed to trick into thinking
2017-09-29 09:04:19	MassDebates	I have something interesting happen here though
2017-09-29 09:05:10	MassDebates	They found my fingerprinting merge tag code and they implemented it on more than just links
2017-09-29 09:05:44	MassDebates	They saw my commented code that applies query strings on the end of images and they uncommented it, but then they also made a second query string on their own (these guys aren't developers, mind you)
2017-09-29 09:05:53	MassDebates	and created a rudimentary tokenization system
2017-09-29 09:06:12	MassDebates	What's neat about this is that any noncaching inbox now gives us a count of how many times the image was served.
2017-09-29 09:07:04	MassDebates	Well, not really the inbox client themselves. Just fetches more, but we have counts here
2017-09-29 09:07:34	thykka	it's almost never a good idea to leave commented code anywhere
2017-09-29 09:07:40	thykka	that's what git is for
2017-09-29 09:07:46	MassDebates	THEY DONT FUCKING LET ME TOUCH GIT
2017-09-29 09:07:49	MassDebates	Sorry
2017-09-29 09:07:51	thykka	:O
2017-09-29 09:08:04	thykka	who? why not?
2017-09-29 09:08:09	MassDebates	Yeah the devs say I'm not allowed to go in there and touch anything
2017-09-29 09:08:14	MassDebates	I have to give it to them and they have to do it
2017-09-29 09:08:18	MassDebates	Well I got in trouble
2017-09-29 09:08:23	MassDebates	and I got yelled at
2017-09-29 09:08:35	MassDebates	Y'know, you guys keep thinking that I'm some sort of a boss here
2017-09-29 09:08:44	MassDebates	I'm the only employee of the company and everyone else here is my boss
2017-09-29 09:08:50	MassDebates	At least that what it feels like
2017-09-29 09:09:10	MassDebates	well, not the only employee but I just feel like I'm the coffee boy of sorts
2017-09-29 09:09:17	thykka	that sucks :S
2017-09-29 09:09:43	MassDebates	At any rate, apparently I've done some not-the-best-things on their git
2017-09-29 09:09:46	MassDebates	They set up a special one for me
2017-09-29 09:10:14	MassDebates	At any rate
2017-09-29 09:10:18	MassDebates	I'm really interested in this email thing
2017-09-29 09:10:36	MassDebates	And for the record, the commented code is just in our template generator
2017-09-29 09:10:49	MassDebates	it needs to be commented because that's how I let them generate emails
2017-09-29 09:11:02	MassDebates	It uses the commented code template pieces and slots them in so everything hatches together
2017-09-29 09:11:24	MassDebates	It knows what layout pieces to use by the configs that are set up in an excel spreadsheet
2017-09-29 09:11:33	MassDebates	my script converts the spreadsheet into useable json data
2017-09-29 09:11:42	MassDebates	and then the json data is used to generate an email layout with merge tags
2017-09-29 09:11:53	MassDebates	the merge tags are used by our ESP to customize and whatnot
2017-09-29 09:12:08	MassDebates	they went through the source code that the layouts are generated from
2017-09-29 09:12:55	MassDebates	So really, I'm very impressed with what they did, but they got a list of like 40k emails (which is a lot for us, especially if it's not vetted/scrubbed) from these businesses in the northeast US
2017-09-29 09:13:14	MassDebates	and they started using it to spam these people who've NEVER opted in, some of them never even heard of us
2017-09-29 09:13:30	thykka	isn't that like.. illegal even?
2017-09-29 09:13:34	MassDebates	Yes.
2017-09-29 09:13:43	MassDebates	Yes it is.
2017-09-29 09:13:52	MassDebates	I don't have a lawyer for the business here.
2017-09-29 09:14:11	MassDebates	But that's alright, it's not like people sue right away
2017-09-29 09:14:26	MassDebates	and the more immediate issue is blacklisting. We lose email and we lose a LOT of ability to render services for clients
2017-09-29 09:14:33	MassDebates	and in-house marketing ability too
2017-09-29 09:19:49	innovati_	thykka morning!
2017-09-29 09:19:55	thykka	hi innovati_
2017-09-29 09:21:24	innovati_	MassDebates sounds complicated
2017-09-29 09:24:13	MassDebates	It's not complicated and the sales reps know better
2017-09-29 09:24:18	MassDebates	You don't email without permission.
2017-09-29 09:24:30	MassDebates	'Nuff said.
2017-09-29 09:24:47	MassDebates	Now I gotta figure how they got these emails
2017-09-29 09:24:56	MassDebates	I gotta figure out how I can vet these
2017-09-29 09:24:59	MassDebates	Anyone have any ideas?
2017-09-29 09:25:22	MassDebates	Considering hiring a cold caller
2017-09-29 09:39:06	innovati_	you can't compare them against known lists, or these are all new, but only some are legally 🆗?
2017-09-29 09:39:32	innovati_	the CAN SPAM thing has some teeth in it so it would be better to lose an uncertain contact than get a real fine
2017-09-29 09:40:12	MassDebates	your penchant for emojis is unceasing lol
2017-09-29 09:40:33	MassDebates	and yes, you're right
2017-09-29 09:40:41	MassDebates	CAN SPAM can be some serious shit at higher volumes
2017-09-29 09:40:52	MassDebates	Canada is harsher on spam than us
2017-09-29 09:41:12	MassDebates	but both are harsh. That's actually a concerted agreement of sorts between the two countries to cooperatively (and more effectively) combat spam
2017-09-29 09:41:39	innovati_	I text-replace stuff to emojis too so sometimes it just happens automatically
2017-09-29 09:41:41	MassDebates	Anyone know any cold calling services to vet and opt in these people?
2017-09-29 09:41:48	MassDebates	lol
2017-09-29 09:42:06	innovati_	can you phone them 🆗, but not email them?
2017-09-29 09:42:15	MassDebates	You're really forcing that one in there hahaha
2017-09-29 09:42:22	MassDebates	yeah you have a right to call anyone
2017-09-29 09:42:34	MassDebates	I mean, even if they're on the DNC lists you can still call without penalty
2017-09-29 09:42:45	thykka	you also have a right to fill their snailmailbox with trash
2017-09-29 09:43:20	innovati_	I also change the word r e p l a c e m e n t with �
2017-09-29 09:43:25	MassDebates	for the most part- its' because the scope of capable actions given out by DNC lists are limited by the _purpose_ and _content_ of the call, which is hugely subjective and easy to weasel out of when it comes to culpability
2017-09-29 09:44:11	MassDebates	thykka:  That's because it's super costly to do so if you send trash it's likely to go nowhere and just burn oyur money
2017-09-29 09:44:23	MassDebates	well, super costly relative to email, that is.
2017-09-29 09:44:32	MassDebates	I'm looking for a good opt-in service that calls people
2017-09-29 09:44:36	MassDebates	(or hell, mails them)
2017-09-29 09:44:41	MassDebates	I want it to be cheap and effective, of course.
2017-09-29 09:44:43	MassDebates	Any ideas?

2017-09-29 12:03:47	innovati	would it shock you if I had made another scoped styles plugin :D
2017-09-29 12:04:14	MassDebates	I'd say crack comes in many forms
2017-09-29 12:04:23	innovati	http://staticresource.com/skopein.html this one uses <link rel=scoped> and a stylesheet with $this selectors so you can apply styles only to the element(s) that match a JS test
2017-09-29 12:04:47	innovati	hopefully I've demonstrated that making an element queries plugin isn't hard
