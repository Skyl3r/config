2016-11-14 09:44:25	keveloper	OCLC
2016-11-14 09:44:38	merkazu	thanks
2016-11-29 10:04:02	keveloper	Hey
2016-11-29 10:04:11	keveloper	I'm being asked my hourly for WP dev
2016-11-29 10:04:31	keveloper	I don't know too much about the job yet
2016-11-29 10:04:34	keveloper	(freelancing)
2016-11-29 10:05:17	keveloper	(I live in Columbus) do you have any advice on what to do here haha
2016-11-29 10:05:23	keveloper	(Second freelancing oppurtunity)
2016-11-29 10:09:17	merkazu	hey, just got back from a meeting
2016-11-29 10:09:25	keveloper	no problem
2016-11-29 10:10:12	merkazu	so, WP dev, do you have any context to go off of? for example, what industry, what client, what are you being asked to do, etc?
2016-11-29 10:11:23	keveloper	i dont have much information on the job yet
2016-11-29 10:11:42	merkazu	what do you have on it?
2016-11-29 10:12:12	merkazu	my first task when being asked for a quote is to ask exploratory questions like this to figure out what's acceptable
2016-11-29 10:12:14	keveloper	Wordpress, "more client side but someone who can at least dig into server side stuff" (lol)
2016-11-29 10:12:26	keveloper	yeah I don't think i can just give him a rate right now right?
2016-11-29 10:12:44	merkazu	not unless you want to base it off another rate you have
2016-11-29 10:12:53	keveloper	My last one was like $22 haha
2016-11-29 10:12:55	keveloper	(first job)
2016-11-29 10:13:22	merkazu	for example, if you're just testing out rates, i typically try to increase it by about 20% between clients until about half of them push back on it
2016-11-29 10:13:52	merkazu	but if you're able to get more information on the job itself, you can look at the value you're creating for the client and take your cut from that
2016-11-29 10:13:56	keveloper	He just said "whats your hourly?"... should I just say "It depends on the work. Can you tell me more about what you need?" or something?
2016-11-29 10:14:22	merkazu	for example, if the job i do would generate $100,000 in sales for that person, the job'd be $10,000
2016-11-29 10:14:39	merkazu	yeah, that's good
2016-11-29 10:14:54	keveloper	okay cool
2016-11-29 10:14:58	keveloper	thanks for your help :P
2016-11-29 10:15:01	keveloper	im completely new to all this
2016-11-29 10:15:02	merkazu	i'd add a bit about being fair and charging for what you get out of this job
2016-11-29 10:15:12	merkazu	so it's fair for both parties
2016-11-29 10:15:25	merkazu	(the $100,000 to $10,000 comparison i was talking about)
2016-11-29 10:16:35	merkazu	"It all depends on the work. I need to know what your goals are for this project and I want to make sure I'm making a fair deal for you."
2016-11-29 10:16:58	merkazu	don't ask them the "need" question, the client doesn't know what the fuck he needs most times
2016-11-29 10:17:31	keveloper	lol i said
2016-11-29 10:17:33	merkazu	if it's increase sales then you can orient the conversation towards billable work that results in increased sales, and so on
2016-11-29 10:18:01	keveloper	"It depends on what kind of work you need done and I'd like to hear more abou tthe job before I throw out a rate so I can make sure it's fair for what you need. Can you tell me more abou tthe job?"
2016-11-29 10:18:07	keveloper	is that okay? :|
2016-11-29 10:18:10	keveloper	*grits teeth* lol
2016-11-29 10:18:34	merkazu	i hope those typos didn't make it in there
2016-11-29 10:18:48	merkazu	but yeah, that's acceptable
2016-11-29 10:18:53	keveloper	lolol no the typos did not
2016-11-29 10:19:15	keveloper	i was just reading it from my phone and typing it :P
2016-11-29 10:19:41	keveloper	again thanks for the help :D
2016-11-29 10:19:47	merkazu	sure thing
2016-11-29 10:19:52	keveloper	i'll probably ask you for help with stuff like this again at some point :P
2016-11-29 10:20:02	keveloper	It's very new to me
2016-11-29 10:20:02	merkazu	always happy to help out
2016-11-29 10:20:11	keveloper	#webdev for life
2016-11-29 10:20:34	merkazu	speaking of which, are you more of a FED or BED?
2016-11-29 10:20:43	merkazu	or what do you enjoy in particular?
2016-11-29 10:20:58	keveloper	im pretty much full stack
2016-11-29 10:21:04	keveloper	i have phases of which i enjoy more
2016-11-29 10:21:06	keveloper	recently FED
2016-11-29 10:21:15	keveloper	My full time job is full stack
2016-11-29 10:21:25	keveloper	currently all back end related work though
2016-11-29 10:21:29	merkazu	how do you feel about slicing PSDs and converting to HTML?
2016-11-29 10:21:50	keveloper	I've done it before, don't have tons of experience with it though
2016-11-29 10:21:51	merkazu	well, html/css
2016-11-29 10:21:57	keveloper	Yeah I knew what you meant
2016-11-29 10:23:12	merkazu	i've got some PSDs being made this week and I'll be looking around for a FED to slice it up for a project I've got going. I was looking at fiverr but we may be able to do something if you're up for it
2016-11-29 10:23:43	merkazu	i just really don't like FED work, i'd rather focus on the high level tasks, managerial/business even
2016-11-29 10:24:14	keveloper	Hmm.. I'm really interested but I'm probably quite slow at converting PSDs to HTML/CSS
2016-11-29 10:26:14	keveloper	I'm assuming you meant for payment?
2016-11-29 10:26:43	merkazu	in reference to which statement?
2016-11-29 10:26:56	keveloper	The work, sorry
2016-11-29 10:27:06	keveloper	PSD to HTML/CSS work
2016-11-29 10:27:43	merkazu	oh yeah, i may hire you for the work if you're feeling up for it and it's not going to be like $1500 to do it
2016-11-29 10:27:47	merkazu	it's just three pages
2016-11-29 10:28:10	keveloper	Hahaha I was not expecting that much :P
2016-11-29 10:28:36	keveloper	What's the timeline?
2016-11-29 10:29:18	merkazu	I should be getting the PSDs by EOW and I'd prefer it to be done in about a week or two
2016-11-29 10:30:12	merkazu	so december 4th to probably december 18th
2016-11-29 10:30:38	keveloper	Those dates work well for me. What amount are you thinking per page?
2016-11-29 10:31:12	merkazu	https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home?t=classes, https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-intro-to-algebra, https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-intro-to-algebra/alg-overview-of-algebra/v/the-beauty-of-algebra
2016-11-29 10:31:32	merkazu	that's the content of the PSDs, with a red/orange/yellow theme instead of the blueish they have right now
2016-11-29 10:32:34	merkazu	give me your thoughts on what you'd take to do a job like this from a PSD
2016-11-29 10:32:52	merkazu	of course, i don't need all of the javascript and whatnot, just clean html/css
2016-11-29 10:33:19	keveloper	What do you mean by what you'd take?
2016-11-29 10:33:30	merkazu	asking for a quote, sorry
2016-11-29 10:34:23	keveloper	$75 per page?
2016-11-29 10:34:48	merkazu	sounds good
2016-11-29 10:34:55	merkazu	you got the job
2016-11-29 10:35:34	keveloper	Cool. PSDs on Friday or before then you think?
2016-11-29 10:35:53	merkazu	submitted the request on monday so it'll probably be saturday
2016-11-29 10:36:05	merkazu	will let you know as soon as it's done
2016-11-29 10:36:41	keveloper	Cool. To be clear: You want raw HTML/CSS correct? No libraries
2016-11-29 10:37:14	merkazu	aye, semantic html preferable. assume modern browsers
2016-11-29 10:38:31	keveloper	Okay cool
2016-11-29 10:43:09	keveloper	How do you want to communicate further?
2016-11-29 10:43:42	merkazu	give me an email address, if i can't grab you on irc, i'll email you from purtlejohnmark@gmail.com
2016-11-29 10:44:40	keveloper	kevinholland94@gmail.com
2016-11-29 10:47:12	merkazu	aight, i'll send a follow up at lunch (+2:15)
2016-11-29 10:47:56	keveloper	Cool, thanks. Excited to work with you
2016-11-29 10:49:12	merkazu	likewise
2016-11-29 10:59:47	keveloper	I found out more about the other job I was talking about earlier if you're still around
2016-11-29 11:05:33	merkazu	i'm mostly around
2016-11-29 11:05:45	merkazu	just small impromptu meetings through the day
2016-11-29 11:06:32	keveloper	"Well the immediate issue is reworking the theme. Our server response time has grown up to 10 seconds and I think the that is the main culprit."
2016-11-29 11:06:54	keveloper	I asked the timeline, he said "none yet, we're still trying to isolate if that truly is the problem"
2016-11-29 11:07:16	keveloper	Seems that the client is just a girl running a WP site?
2016-11-29 11:07:29	keveloper	I'm not sure what my contact's role is in this
2016-11-29 11:10:01	merkazu	hmm, it's a bit of a common issue with WP themes from what i've heard. lots of bloat in it
2016-11-29 11:11:51	merkazu	the question, then, would be if you're doing a refresh or if you're cleaning up the work done on it presently. If a refresh, I'd look at some of the places where the theme doesn't really help promote the content well and suggest updates.
2016-11-29 11:13:02	merkazu	and yeah, given it's wordpress, it may not even be an issue with the theme itself, it may be the internal structure. attempting to query too much data or doing too much server-side work
2016-11-29 11:13:22	merkazu	that's a good upsell for general improvements to the site
2016-11-29 11:13:53	merkazu	do you know what industry or what kind of business that site is supporting?
2016-11-29 11:14:15	keveloper	dollhousesandmore.com
2016-11-29 11:16:02	keveloper	"honestly the theme update would be pretty simple but moving her to a theme thats easy to work with would be a big step"
2016-11-29 11:16:03	merkazu	hmm, not going to look at the site right now, maybe over lunch. the url tells me that it's a relative niche industry, may be okay margins so you could look at somewhere around 35-60/hr
2016-11-29 11:16:46	merkazu	hey, not a bad sell opportunity as well, find a new theme that'd be easy to work with, does a good job for the content and upsell the installation
2016-11-29 11:17:40	keveloper	Definitely niche industry.
2016-11-29 11:18:11	keveloper	Yeah this seems like a pretty simple job.
2016-11-29 11:18:19	keveloper	Thanks, you've been super helpful
2016-11-29 11:18:31	merkazu	not a problem
2016-11-29 13:55:25	merkazu	sent over a follow up email regarding what we talked about. I'll be in a meeting for the next 30 minutes ish, then out again for another half-hour at 2pm
2016-11-29 13:55:59	keveloper	Okay, I'll check it out
2016-11-29 14:01:44	keveloper	I assume there will be wireframes for the medium and small responsive designs>
2016-11-29 14:01:46	keveloper	?*
2016-11-29 14:19:52	merkazu	there should be. if they don't show up, you can just refer to the links I provided you earlier for the responsive behavior. It's mostly just sticking the sidebar in after the about/transcript section for the video page, above the course sections for the course overview page, and stacking content in the classes page
2016-11-29 14:20:14	merkazu	if you're building mobile first, it's actually kinda trivial
2016-11-29 14:20:53	merkazu	i do have a few html/css files from when i took a jab at developing the video page myself if you'd like that as a reference on what i'm expecting
2016-11-29 14:21:08	keveloper	That would be great
2016-11-29 14:21:22	merkazu	allright, I'll send that to you when i get back home
2016-11-29 14:21:46	keveloper	I hadn't considered responsive design in my previous rate, would you be willing to do $90/page with that considered?
2016-11-29 14:23:06	merkazu	yeah, that's perfectly fine, feel free to respond to the email with that amendment.
2016-11-29 14:23:22	merkazu	Also, do you have any sort of invoicing plan set up?
2016-11-29 14:24:06	keveloper	I do not. I'm not sure what you mean by that
2016-11-29 14:27:30	merkazu	this is for helping you get into the flow of professional freelancing. when you deal with larger clients, you usually have to issue an invoice to get paid. I'll need some sort of document that lists line items for work done and a total to be paid and to whom. I'm happy to pay you via Paypal using their invoice feature if necessary, otherwise, you can email/snail mail me an invoice and I'll mail you a check once everything's good to go
2016-11-29 14:32:23	keveloper	What do you recommend? I'm willing to do whatever is most professional, especially for the future
2016-11-29 14:36:56	merkazu	it's usually better for the client to pay via check as they avoid the most fees in that fashion. I'd just search for a blank invoice template on google  and fill out the details on that, print it out or email it (either way is fine)
2016-11-29 14:37:19	merkazu	paypal's fees are exorbitant and i've had accounts frozen by them before
2016-11-29 14:39:45	keveloper	Okay will do. Doing some things at work today but Ill get it to you today
2016-11-29 14:40:16	merkazu	no need to build the invoice until after you've done the work and ready to deliver
2016-11-29 14:42:18	keveloper	Ah, okay
2016-11-29 14:44:34	merkazu	you could also look at Freshbooks or Harvest for managing your freelancing finances and invoicing
2016-11-29 14:45:12	merkazu	i'm a fairly simple guy so i just have a blank invoice template and excel
2016-11-29 15:13:13	keveloper	I'll probably just use a template in excel
2016-11-29 15:20:34	keveloper	I sent you an email with the updated rate
2016-12-01 05:38:44	<--	merkazu (~merkazu@104.236.217.197) has quit (*.net *.split)
2016-12-01 05:44:52	-->	merkazu (~merkazu@104.236.217.197) is back on server
2016-12-03 11:21:24	merkazu	you about?
2016-12-04 12:00:29	merkazu	around?
2016-12-05 08:49:12	keveloper	sorry, dont get on irc much over the weekend
2016-12-05 08:52:34	merkazu	it's okay
2017-01-03 15:27:45	keveloper	Hey, any news on the PSD to HTML/CSS job?
2017-01-03 15:31:30	merkazu	ah, yes, in my blindness, I realized that two of the pages are essentially the same. I need to finish up making the responsive views of the two pages that I want done. Are you cool with $180 for the job? Still $90/page as we've talked about
2017-01-03 15:31:57	keveloper	Two pages, including responsive design for each?
2017-01-03 15:32:11	merkazu	aye
2017-01-03 15:33:04	keveloper	Yeah, we agreed to that, so I will stick with that agreement
2017-01-03 15:33:47	keveloper	Just a heads up, I'll be at a code conference Jan 11th to Jan 14th
2017-01-03 15:34:53	merkazu	oh, that won't be a problem, the files'll be provided on the 16th. That should give me enough time to finish those views up
2017-01-03 15:35:13	keveloper	Okay sounds good
2017-01-03 15:35:48	keveloper	Next conflict after that will be Feb 25 to March 5, and I'd imagine it'll be well done by then
2017-01-03 15:44:22	merkazu	yeah, i think so too
2017-01-03 15:47:18	keveloper	Cool, looking forward to it
2017-01-16 11:38:36	keveloper	To reiterate: No JS, No frameworks, just CSS/HTML
2017-01-16 11:39:02	keveloper	Chrome, FF, Safari, IE 11/Edge
2017-01-16 11:39:49	merkazu	CSS/HTML preferred, bootstrap okay, jquery okay, no front-end framework (angular, react, etc), modern web browsers (flexbox a-okay)
2017-01-16 11:40:16	keveloper	Oh I didn't know bootstrap and jquery were okay... 
2017-01-16 11:40:19	keveloper	Flexbox thank god
2017-01-16 11:40:29	keveloper	I probably won't use bootstrap
2017-01-16 11:40:38	merkazu	haha, yeah, i know
2017-01-16 11:40:48	keveloper	Have you seen semantic ui
2017-01-16 11:40:59	keveloper	Saw a talk on it at codemash, it looks awesome
2017-01-16 11:41:02	merkazu	heard about it a bit but never really used it
2017-01-16 11:41:10	keveloper	It looks great, you should check it out.
2017-01-16 11:41:18	keveloper	(Not asking to use it just telling haha)
2017-01-16 11:41:19	merkazu	i'm mostly a semantic html guy :)
2017-01-16 11:41:45	keveloper	It does give you class names that describe style (which I don't love) but that can be solved with SCSS
2017-01-16 11:41:50	keveloper	It reads really nice either way
2017-01-16 11:42:05	merkazu	oh, that's another thing, SCSS is a-okay too
2017-01-16 11:42:16	keveloper	Wow this just keeps getting better and better
2017-01-16 11:42:24	keveloper	Do you want the compiled css delivered
2017-01-16 11:42:31	merkazu	in fact, it'll probably even be a bit of a bonus if you provide me with the source
2017-01-16 11:42:41	merkazu	i can compile it myself
2017-01-16 11:42:45	keveloper	Okay
2017-01-16 11:42:56	keveloper	Source for icons?
2017-01-16 11:43:13	keveloper	That wasn't asking for elaboration on your last message, a new question
2017-01-16 11:43:16	keveloper	Do you have a preference
2017-01-16 11:43:24	keveloper	I prefer google icons, but if you want font awesome thats cool too
2017-01-16 11:43:38	merkazu	go for it
2017-01-16 11:44:13	keveloper	Also SVG or imported style with classes for icons or do you not care
2017-01-16 11:44:23	merkazu	mind providing me with a reference for the google icons?
2017-01-16 11:44:31	merkazu	i think it's this: https://material.io/icons/ but i'm not sure
2017-01-16 11:44:34	keveloper	https://material.io/icons/
2017-01-16 11:44:36	keveloper	Yes correct
2017-01-16 11:44:42	merkazu	yeah, totally okay
2017-01-16 11:44:47	keveloper	This is my go to
2017-01-16 11:44:56	keveloper	https://material.io/icons/#ic_play_circle_filled
2017-01-16 11:44:59	keveloper	There's the play button
2017-01-16 11:45:12	merkazu	go ahead and pick what makes it better for you
2017-01-16 11:45:22	keveloper	Cool, I'm excited for this, looks fun
2017-01-16 11:45:25	keveloper	I'll start tonight
2017-01-16 11:45:32	merkazu	the only thing i'm adamant about is not using a front-end framework like react or angular
2017-01-16 11:45:40	keveloper	Loud and clear haha
2017-01-16 11:46:08	keveloper	I would never throw that into a mock up like this
2017-01-16 11:46:28	merkazu	speaking of which, how is it?
2017-01-16 11:46:59	merkazu	i had to work off of the desktop version because the person producing the initial PSD never did the tablet/mobile layouts
2017-01-16 12:27:07	keveloper	How is what?
2017-01-16 12:27:35	keveloper	Oh the PSDs? Great, I like how you put all the sizes in one PSD
2017-01-16 12:58:20	merkazu	great, i'm glad
2017-01-16 12:58:21	merkazu	i'll be sure to do that with the future ones
2017-01-16 13:39:07	keveloper	I might end up converting it to a pdf so I don't have to have gimp open but not a big deal
2017-01-16 13:39:19	keveloper	I can't zoom in the preview that OS X shows
2017-01-17 19:14:57	keveloper	yt?
2017-01-17 19:15:07	merkazu	what's up?
2017-01-17 19:15:54	keveloper	What are the size of med and sm?
2017-01-17 19:16:49	merkazu	the first thing is like 1500px, that's for everything beyond 960px, the second column is for 480px - 960px, the third column is for 320px - 480px
2017-01-17 19:19:23	merkazu	i'd probably just go ahead and lock it out at 1920px and center it horizontally on the page if that makes it easier for you
2017-01-17 19:21:01	merkazu	i'd recommend starting with the 320px view though, easier to expand up than to shrink down
2017-01-17 19:25:10	merkazu	does that help you out?
2017-01-17 19:27:42	keveloper	yeah thanks
2017-01-17 19:28:00	merkazu	great, let me know if you have any other questions
2017-01-17 19:34:06	keveloper	what font are you using here?
2017-01-17 19:35:38	merkazu	font really doesn't matter, original was based on proximia nova but you can go for arial unless you have a font you think would work well for it. if you do, let me know so i can be prepared to purchase if necessary
2017-01-17 19:36:20	merkazu	yeah, PSD states proxima nova
2017-01-17 21:26:00	keveloper	so far im just using catamaran
2017-01-17 21:26:08	keveloper	https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Catamaran
2017-01-17 21:26:14	keveloper	its free from google
2017-01-17 21:27:13	keveloper	I have most of the first page done minus some responsive elements and the footer
2017-01-17 21:27:27	merkazu	impressive
2017-01-17 21:28:00	keveloper	we'll see if you still think that when i show you :P
2017-01-17 21:28:19	merkazu	haha
2017-01-17 21:32:02	keveloper	im assume the aside contents will use anchors? im thinking that should be a <nav>?
2017-01-17 21:34:49	merkazu	the steps in the sidebar, i plan on being separate pages rather than anchors so yeah, nav should work
2017-01-18 10:19:23	--	irc: disconnected from server
2017-01-18 20:52:07	keveloper	hey you there?
2017-01-18 20:52:19	merkazu	what's up?
2017-01-18 20:52:33	keveloper	What would you prefer I do with the line separating each course?
2017-01-18 20:52:50	keveloper	I'm assuming you don't use <hr>'s?
2017-01-18 20:53:10	keveloper	Or would you expect there to be a separator span or something...
2017-01-18 20:53:19	merkazu	hmm, aren't <hr> full screen widths?
2017-01-18 20:53:24	keveloper	No
2017-01-18 20:53:27	keveloper	Just the div
2017-01-18 20:53:35	keveloper	In chrome at least haha
2017-01-18 20:54:14	keveloper	I can put a 'last' class on the last course and not put a border-bottom on that
2017-01-18 20:54:19	merkazu	hmm, if it doesn't fit an unordered list then hr would be okay
2017-01-18 20:55:10	merkazu	yeah, i'd recommend border bottom tbh, do something along the lines of ul li:not(:last-child)
2017-01-18 20:55:11	keveloper	I don't have the courses as a list currently
2017-01-18 20:55:21	keveloper	I can change that though
2017-01-18 20:55:44	keveloper	Oh duh
2017-01-18 20:55:45	merkazu	it fits overall, it's a list of courses or course steps
2017-01-18 20:55:55	keveloper	Yeah I'll change that
2017-01-18 21:00:58	keveloper	Do you have a desired delivery date for this?
2017-01-18 21:01:33	keveloper	First page will definitely be done by Sunday, probably with a good start on the second at that point
2017-01-18 21:01:35	merkazu	a specific date? no, but you do have two weeks as per our agreement, so end of jan.
2017-01-18 21:01:50	merkazu	if you need an extension, no worries
2017-01-18 21:02:00	keveloper	What kind of JS functionality do you want?
2017-01-18 21:02:19	merkazu	i don't think it really needs any, do you?
2017-01-18 21:02:23	keveloper	Do you want the hamburger to display a menu? Or do you want the search input to appear on the icon click on mobile?
2017-01-18 21:02:51	keveloper	I have no preference
2017-01-18 21:03:37	merkazu	i'd say either an off-canvas menu or just have the menu items appear in between the header bar and the main content
2017-01-18 21:04:37	merkazu	https://codepen.io/rbardtke/pen/nfkdb for a flexbox version
2017-01-18 21:04:43	keveloper	I'll make that last priorty as it seems that's not incredibly important to you
2017-01-18 21:04:57	merkazu	https://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/uIemr for :checked version
2017-01-18 21:05:17	merkazu	aye, i haven't really decided how i plan on approaching menu contents yet
2017-01-18 21:05:38	keveloper	Oh I hate those checkbox menus
2017-01-18 21:05:56	merkazu	why's that?
2017-01-18 21:06:02	keveloper	I'd rather have 3 lines of javascript than that hacky toggle thing... 
2017-01-18 21:06:08	keveloper	That's not what a text box is for
2017-01-18 21:06:14	keveloper	Idk I feel wrong misusing html elements
2017-01-18 21:06:23	merkazu	fair enough
2017-01-18 21:06:34	merkazu	i did grant an exception for usability
2017-01-18 21:06:36	keveloper	I'm on the semantic, clean HTML banwagon right now haha
2017-01-18 21:06:47	keveloper	I do think it is cool that you can do it with pure html/css
2017-01-18 21:06:59	keveloper	But as far as cleanliness/readability I dont love it
2017-01-18 21:07:18	merkazu	it's doing all sorts of nutty stuff like a bajillion ajax calls to load in different content on different sections that i take exception to
2017-01-18 21:07:44	keveloper	anonymous function js hell haha
2017-01-18 21:08:15	keveloper	I'm headed off to bed for the night, I'll continue work tomorrow, probably will have some questions at some point
2017-01-18 21:08:17	keveloper	See ya!
2017-01-18 21:08:24	merkazu	sure thing :)
2017-01-19 09:25:51	keveloper	I finished the first page last night (stayed up a little later) with responsive layouts also, I can send you the first pass on that tonight before starting the second one to see if you have any input
2017-01-19 09:25:56	keveloper	Does that sound good?
2017-01-19 09:26:15	merkazu	sure
2017-01-19 09:26:26	keveloper	cool, probably will be around 5 or something
2017-01-19 09:32:14	merkazu	sounds good
2017-01-19 17:53:31	keveloper	Is a git repository okay (public? I can make a private one on bitbucket otherwise)
2017-01-19 17:54:56	merkazu	i'd prefer a zip file, personally
2017-01-19 17:55:10	keveloper	Okay
2017-01-19 17:55:11	merkazu	but i can access a bitbucket repo later if necessary
2017-01-19 18:06:06	keveloper	Is email fine?
2017-01-19 18:07:53	keveloper	Sent to your email
2017-01-19 18:46:59	merkazu	thanks, four things. The first thing is if I resize the page below 480px, the sign in/sign up bit doesn't become the hamburger menu. I think this may be related to the second thing, the missing javascript file. The third, the footer sections maintain their margins past 960px, this should have been removed at that point (or reduced in link-group's case). That should also help resolve the contact us column's overflow problem. It looks like you're
2017-01-19 18:46:59	merkazu	 relying on just a margin-left to knock the first footer section over, I need for it to have a bit of breathing room. It's okay if "Share Your Story" breaks to multiple lines
2017-01-19 18:48:51	merkazu	good markup, interesting CSS bracket usage
2017-01-19 18:49:23	merkazu	ah, that's just the compiler, scss looks good
2017-01-19 22:01:37	keveloper	Yeah the hamburger just slipped my mind (oops).
2017-01-19 22:02:33	keveloper	I don't have a javascript file for it. The bundle.js was from node (I'm using a reload.js file to reload changes and forgot to remove th script tag. 
2017-01-19 22:02:44	keveloper	Footer margin issue I'll fix tomorrow
2017-01-19 22:03:59	keveloper	But yeah I have a node front end start pack I use for front end dev and I stripped the stuff you care about out of it
2017-01-19 22:05:11	keveloper	I'll clean up the markup/SCSS and you should have the finish copy tomorrow
2017-01-20 20:04:24	keveloper	I sent you the updated version with the fixes above
2017-01-22 15:59:05	keveloper	Hey, I sent the course page as well as an updated courses page. Both are finished with responsive design also. Let me know if you see anyhing wrong with them
2017-01-23 21:15:03	merkazu	good work
2017-01-23 22:28:24	keveloper	Thanks. Hope everything looks good. If you ever need something like this again (or any other web dev job) I'm always looking for work. Nice working with you.
2017-01-24 09:46:36	keveloper	Hey would you be willing to receive an invoice online/pay via pay pal, or do you prefer mail?
2017-01-24 09:53:40	merkazu	i can do online invoices if you have that capability
2017-01-24 12:46:34	keveloper	What service did you recommend a while bag?
2017-01-24 12:46:35	keveloper	back*
2017-01-24 13:01:30	merkazu	i think it was called wave
2017-01-24 13:20:05	keveloper	"What is the name of your busines?" Uhh... lol
2017-01-24 13:25:29	keveloper	I'll send one your way after work using wave
2017-01-24 13:25:40	keveloper	Lets say by 6pm EST you should have it
2017-01-24 13:47:09	merkazu	cool
2017-01-24 17:54:18	keveloper	I sent the invoice to your gmail
2017-01-24 17:56:18	merkazu	okay, i'll get this printed off and mailed momentarily
2017-01-24 17:56:57	keveloper	I just realized my address is not on there. Were you going to mail a check?
2017-01-24 17:58:38	keveloper	I can resend the invoice with an address if so
2017-01-24 17:59:41	merkazu	i don't see an electronic pay option. I can make do if you provide me an address via email
2017-01-24 18:00:47	keveloper	I will enable electronic pay. (Sorry bare with me -_-)
2017-01-24 18:02:46	keveloper	I enabled online pay
2017-01-24 18:29:51	merkazu	awesome, saves me from having to go out and get a new printer >_>
2017-01-24 18:30:11	merkazu	this one seems to have kicked the bucket from being inactive for 6+ months
2017-01-24 18:34:15	merkazu	++
2017-01-24 18:42:32	merkazu	with Wave, your payment should hit your bank account Friday
2017-01-24 18:47:01	keveloper	Just got the payment notification. Thanks. great working with you.
2017-01-24 18:47:09	merkazu	likewise
2017-01-24 19:52:10	keveloper	I'm always looking for work if another job comes up. Let me know
2017-01-24 20:49:06	merkazu	happen to know a semi-decent copywriter?
2017-01-25 10:39:51	keveloper	How technical is the subject? My girlfriend is in her senior year in college and is a marketing/business management dual major. She wants to do copywriting and has experience with some writing for a marketing agency she worked for for 8 months, then she's written some for the company her dad works at. She's also in a marketing internship right now. I think she might be interested
2017-01-25 10:40:39	merkazu	not super technical, some of it will be sales copy, others general copy (about us page and things like that)
2017-01-25 10:41:17	merkazu	the sales copy would be mostly, "we capture the best data on your learners for deep integration across the entire system" type of thing
2017-01-25 10:41:46	merkazu	so, having worked at a marketing agency is actually right up that alley
2017-01-25 10:42:28	keveloper	This is the company she worked for: http://theshipyard.com/
2017-01-25 10:43:06	keveloper	I know there are websites with her content but I don't have any links right now
2017-01-25 10:43:22	keveloper	She asked what you mean by "sales copy"
2017-01-25 10:43:22	merkazu	http://theshipyard.com/total-intelligence/ closest to the level of content i'd be asking
2017-01-25 10:44:16	merkazu	sales copy being the things like the predictive analytics, media mix modelling and then SaaS pricing page content
2017-01-25 11:13:06	keveloper	She said she may be interested. I think she wants to hear more about it.
2017-01-25 11:13:27	keveloper	Her email is eyocum@capital.edu
2017-01-25 11:13:37	merkazu	yeah, i need to formulate my next steps then we'd be able to proceed
2017-01-25 11:14:56	keveloper	Cool, can I tell her a time when you expect to email her by?
2017-01-25 11:15:21	merkazu	mmm, Sunday?
2017-01-25 11:16:17	merkazu	most likely sunday morning
2017-01-25 11:16:30	keveloper	Okay cool
2017-01-25 11:17:40	keveloper	To be clear she wants to hear more about before she'll decide if she wants to do it
2017-01-25 11:17:44	keveloper	She is interested though
2017-01-25 11:18:19	merkazu	aye, i don't have the concept fully fleshed out for copy purposes yet
2017-01-25 11:20:52	keveloper	Is this related to the same site I was working on?
2017-01-25 11:20:59	merkazu	yeah
2017-01-25 11:21:16	merkazu	all of the jobs i'll have in the next few months are going to be related to that
2017-01-25 11:21:26	keveloper	Just curious, idk if you are legally able to tell me but is it actually for khan academy? Or were you just modelling off of khan academy?
2017-01-25 11:21:37	merkazu	modelling off
2017-01-25 11:21:39	keveloper	Ah okay
2017-01-25 11:21:47	merkazu	their markup is jank as hell
2017-01-25 11:21:57	keveloper	Khan academies?
2017-01-25 11:22:02	keveloper	wow academy's ** lol
2017-01-25 11:22:05	merkazu	aye
2017-01-25 11:22:10	keveloper	Lemme go look at this lol
2017-01-25 11:22:44	keveloper	oh nice I love the class box-sizing-border-box-reset
2017-01-25 11:22:51	keveloper	Inline styles
2017-01-25 11:22:53	keveloper	They've got it all lol
2017-01-25 11:23:22	keveloper	Also talk about div soup
2017-01-25 11:24:11	merkazu	yeah, but i do like the overall visual appearance. so i'm taking a derivative of that, combining it with Magnus backend and positioning it as a firehose of information to combine with other products i plan to introduce in time
2017-01-25 11:24:14	keveloper	This is honestly some of the worst div soup I have seen
2017-01-25 11:24:19	keveloper	Yeah it looks great honestly
2017-01-25 11:24:40	merkazu	for example, how does your training impact your call-center statistics
2017-01-25 11:24:40	keveloper	I liked those wireframes you gave me
2017-01-25 11:25:19	merkazu	take course 123, see 5% shorter support calls for example or take that course and sell 10% higher
2017-01-25 11:25:47	merkazu	and i'm also looking to kill the scourge that is SCORM packages, those are a plague
2017-01-25 11:26:08	keveloper	I don't know what that is
2017-01-25 11:26:13	keveloper	ah okay im reading
2017-01-25 11:26:18	merkazu	awful to work with, awful to develop, the only good thing they have going is the portability between learning management systems
2017-01-25 11:26:44	keveloper	But look though http://cdn2.scorm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/thegraph1.png
2017-01-25 11:27:08	keveloper	That graphic is literally the most useless thing
2017-01-25 11:27:13	merkazu	hehe
2017-01-30 13:44:28	merkazu	Did she get the email from me?
2017-01-30 13:44:51	 *	merkazu hopes that it didn't get marked to go towards junk/promotional
2017-01-30 13:45:07	keveloper	Yeah she did
2017-01-30 13:45:11	keveloper	I think she plans to reply today
2017-01-30 13:45:15	merkazu	cool
2017-01-30 13:45:20	keveloper	We had a wedding this weekend so a lot goin on
2017-01-30 13:45:47	merkazu	that's right, you did mention that
2017-01-30 13:45:55	merkazu	fun?
2017-01-30 13:46:19	keveloper	Yeah it ended up being pretty good
2017-01-30 13:46:41	keveloper	Open bar, unlimited free drinks so.. that was good haha
2017-01-30 13:47:09	merkazu	you get a manhattan, you get a manhattan, everyone gets a manhattan
2017-01-30 13:48:08	keveloper	They had a groom's and bride's special, the bride's special was some raspberry sparkling limeade vodka cocktail.. It was incredible haha
2017-01-30 13:48:15	keveloper	Hhad like 5 too many of those lol
2017-01-30 13:50:33	merkazu	ooh, my mouth is watering at that thought
2017-01-30 13:51:24	keveloper	Vodka cocktails are my favorite so it got the best of me haha
2017-01-30 13:52:00	keveloper	I was like "Okay I need to stop" then 10 minutes later the band was like "We just got the word we are playing for another half hour!" and I was like "welp, might as well keep going" lolol
2017-01-30 13:59:36	merkazu	haha
2017-01-30 19:28:15	merkazu	interested in developing an API document?
2017-01-30 19:29:26	merkazu	or know someone that might be?
2017-01-31 08:53:11	keveloper	Literally just API documentation?
2017-01-31 08:53:33	keveloper	How many endpoints/parameters are there
2017-01-31 18:40:59	merkazu	literally that, but i'd be asking to come up with all of the relevant endpoints one can think of then writing up the high level documentation regarding it
2017-01-31 18:42:41	merkazu	for example PUT /curriculums/{id}/courses/{id}, (requirements), (individual records for each relevant status code), (responses for each)
2017-01-31 18:42:52	merkazu	terribly boring work tbh
2017-01-31 18:43:19	merkazu	but the codebase itself -is- my secret sauce
2017-02-01 09:11:57	keveloper	'my secret sauce' lol
2017-02-01 09:12:15	merkazu	:)
2017-02-01 09:12:29	keveloper	Yeah I'd be willing to do that I think
2017-02-01 09:12:40	keveloper	I understand REST APIs well so
2017-02-01 09:13:18	merkazu	cool, what do you need for a quote?
2017-02-01 09:14:17	keveloper	I guess just requirements from you, type of data returned (assuming JSON), unless you wanna do hypermedia
2017-02-01 09:14:28	keveloper	I've never written a hypermedia rest api though
2017-02-01 09:14:41	 *	merkazu googles
2017-02-01 09:14:53	keveloper	Yeah I didn't know what it was until codemash so
2017-02-01 09:15:27	keveloper	They can't return JSON/XML by nature
2017-02-01 09:15:37	merkazu	that's silly
2017-02-01 09:15:45	merkazu	nix the hypermedia
2017-02-01 09:16:06	keveloper	Well its a self documenting API because every response tells the user/client what actions can be done in the given state
2017-02-01 09:16:14	merkazu	and i just mainly need the endpoints and surrounding documents, you're free to flat out assume json
2017-02-01 09:22:17	keveloper	Yeah I can probably do that
2017-02-01 09:23:53	merkazu	GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, an url string, 200's, 201, 204, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 409 and 410 responses, some notes on expectations (requires valid course id, can use null to automatically generate new id, super-admin requirements (usually when dealing with deletions or replacements of large collections e.g all curriculums, all courses, all users, those sorts of things). I'll be building the code samples anyway when the codebase is being
2017-02-01 09:23:53	merkazu	 built so you can omit sample input/responses 
2017-02-01 09:25:56	keveloper	Have you looked into swagger?
2017-02-01 09:27:01	merkazu	yeah, i'm just slow when it comes to typing out documentation in general
2017-02-01 09:27:14	merkazu	laziness may be a factor :)
2017-02-03 09:06:15	merkazu	do you need me to email you with a job request like before for the API documentation?
2017-02-03 09:12:32	keveloper	Yeah that will work
2017-02-03 09:12:46	keveloper	Sorry I got distracted and this slipped my mind
2017-02-03 09:17:17	merkazu	that's cool, i'll take care of it on saturday along with emily's brief she requested
2017-02-03 09:19:34	keveloper	Okay sounds good
2017-02-08 10:59:19	keveloper	Do you have a portfolio site
2017-02-08 11:00:34	merkazu	personally? no
2017-02-08 11:00:37	merkazu	why?
2017-02-08 11:00:51	keveloper	Just wondering, I'm redoing mine right now
2017-02-08 11:00:51	merkazu	my contacts are 100% word of mouth
2017-02-08 11:01:09	keveloper	My existing one is baaaad, and I never really completeted it haha
2017-02-08 11:01:14	keveloper	kevinholland.me
2017-02-08 11:02:00	merkazu	background took a while to load
2017-02-08 11:03:31	keveloper	Yeah its an embedded canvas thing
2017-02-08 11:03:36	keveloper	slrsystm.space
2017-02-08 11:03:43	keveloper	Its a skimmed down version of that thing that I made
2017-02-08 11:04:39	keveloper	But yeah that's being removed lol, that was a dumb idea
2017-02-10 09:42:03	keveloper	Hey, if you still need me for the API design/documentation and I can reply back to that email this weekend. Sorry its been a while
2017-02-10 09:42:36	merkazu	it's cool, i'm just doing it myself but I'll have some UI work later
2017-02-10 09:47:18	merkazu	Talked to a buddy of mine last night over drinks. seems like this project is going in a good direction. solving an all-too-common problem for businesses
2017-02-10 09:47:54	merkazu	understanding impacts on other parts of a system from an investment in one, like training. quite difficult to quantify
2017-02-10 09:48:11	keveloper	Okay cool, my bad
2017-02-10 09:48:19	merkazu	nbd
2017-02-10 09:48:23	keveloper	I'd love to do more UI work for you
2017-02-10 09:48:50	merkazu	that's more of the kind of stuff you'd like to do huh?
2017-02-10 09:49:18	merkazu	any other preferences?
2017-02-10 09:50:42	keveloper	Just mostly front end dev/UI design
2017-02-10 09:50:53	keveloper	What language/framework are you using for backend?
2017-02-10 09:54:39	merkazu	backend is either python or PHP
2017-02-10 09:55:17	merkazu	given the difficulties with spinning up python at the moment, i may just be starting out with PHP then transition to webcore later
2017-02-10 09:55:30	merkazu	i have a webcore-like router built in PHP to act as the backbone
2017-02-10 10:01:19	keveloper	Ah okay cool. I'm mostly a jvm man lol
2017-02-10 10:01:29	keveloper	I've done wordpress php though -_-
2017-02-10 10:01:51	keveloper	I wrote my last portfolio site in php but it was baaad
2017-02-10 19:10:44	merkazu	mmm, question
2017-02-10 19:11:13	merkazu	if you got pen and paper sketches with fairly detailed measurements and notes, do you think you could do things from that?
2017-02-10 19:11:20	merkazu	or do you need a PSD?
2017-02-10 19:11:34	merkazu	these'll be for UI elements, not whole pages
2017-02-13 09:10:24	keveloper	Yeah for sure
2017-02-21 15:28:14	keveloper	Emily's been showing me some of what she's written for LughLMS, I'm liking it :P
2017-02-21 15:28:39	merkazu	haha, that's great, i'm glad to hear it
2017-02-21 15:28:54	merkazu	been busying myself with the actual backend work
2017-02-21 15:29:27	merkazu	mostly reimplementing the router since it's been eh, an year and a half since i actually cleaned it up
2017-02-21 15:29:28	keveloper	Think she's working on the accessibility section right now
2017-02-21 15:29:30	keveloper	Hows that going
2017-02-21 15:29:44	merkazu	pretty good actually, got to clean up a fair bit of the code
2017-02-21 15:29:47	keveloper	Youre using php right?
2017-02-21 15:29:53	keveloper	By router you mean
2017-02-21 15:29:56	merkazu	initially, yes
2017-02-21 15:30:03	merkazu	the url to action resolver
2017-02-21 15:30:07	keveloper	Ah okay cool
2017-02-21 15:30:18	keveloper	Are you using your own framework?
2017-02-21 15:30:27	merkazu	aye, Magnus
2017-02-21 15:30:42	merkazu	pretty poor shape on github though
2017-02-21 15:38:09	keveloper	Oh is this a wordpress theme
2017-02-21 15:38:21	merkazu	hmm?
2017-02-21 15:38:27	keveloper	magnus
2017-02-21 15:38:55	keveloper	Wait wait
2017-02-21 15:38:58	keveloper	is this gothalice's thing
2017-02-21 15:38:58	merkazu	t'would have been here: https://github.com/jmpurtle/Magnus
2017-02-21 15:39:13	merkazu	99% this: https://github.com/jmpurtle/Router
2017-02-21 15:39:40	merkazu	i wasn't kidding about the poor state of the project itself
2017-02-21 15:40:09	keveloper	I search magnus framework and the first thing to pop up was one of GothAlice's projects
2017-02-21 15:40:09	merkazu	that readme is so out of date, it hurts my heart
2017-02-21 15:40:31	merkazu	it -is- loosely based off of Webcore
2017-02-21 15:43:48	merkazu	while it seems a bit silly, i will be open sourcing the guts of LughLMS as magnus framework components
2017-02-21 15:44:00	merkazu	value's not in the parts, it's the assembly
2017-02-21 15:44:14	merkazu	tis how Webcore is as well
2017-02-21 15:44:55	keveloper	Is webcore widely used
2017-02-21 15:45:16	merkazu	no
2017-02-21 15:45:33	merkazu	we're in #webcore
2017-02-21 15:45:50	merkazu	4 active users iirc
2017-02-21 15:46:11	merkazu	the biggest pain is the fact that it's a python nanoframework
2017-02-21 15:47:25	keveloper	oh okay
2017-02-21 15:47:33	merkazu	magnus is largely being built to make the concepts of WebCore more accessible
2017-02-21 15:47:56	keveloper	Why not just use a more popular framework?
2017-02-21 15:48:08	merkazu	tried to get it rolling at my last job, but since i quit, they didn't want to bother and just start paying out of the ass for an expensive contractor
2017-02-21 15:48:20	merkazu	zend framework 3 :/
2017-02-21 15:48:39	merkazu	because the PHP frameworks right now suck, pretty badly
2017-02-21 15:48:56	keveloper	:/
2017-02-21 15:48:57	merkazu	you cannot really begin to even trace through that stuff to figure out what's going on
2017-02-21 15:49:10	merkazu	stack traces routinely exceeding 40+
2017-02-21 15:49:26	keveloper	40+ lines?
2017-02-21 15:49:33	merkazu	levels
2017-02-21 15:49:37	keveloper	Oh my
2017-02-21 15:50:00	keveloper	We have groovy and spring boot which makes exceptions pretty lengthy but not that bad
2017-02-21 15:50:08	merkazu	the router and associated components almost never exceed two or three layers
2017-02-21 15:50:14	merkazu	for Magnus
2017-02-21 15:50:25	keveloper	Why not switch to a different language :P
2017-02-21 15:50:43	merkazu	time to market
2017-02-21 15:50:52	keveloper	Fair enough
2017-02-21 15:51:10	keveloper	Are you most comfortable with php?
2017-02-21 15:51:22	merkazu	bread and butter
2017-02-21 15:51:38	keveloper	Yeah that's me with java lol
2017-02-21 15:51:43	merkazu	i'm largely evading the quirks with Magnus
2017-02-21 15:56:54	keveloper	Let me know if you have any front end stuff you need done
2017-02-21 15:57:10	keveloper	I'm currently doing some back end library science stuff that is just brutally dry lol
2017-02-21 15:57:15	merkazu	i'll be able to catch up later, i'm still trying to figure out what'll be good to send your way
2017-02-21 15:57:34	merkazu	crunch time for the next two hours, major deployment on $client's site
2017-02-21 15:57:46	merkazu	lots o' fiddly shit
2017-02-21 15:58:02	keveloper	Have a great time :P
2017-02-21 15:58:15	merkazu	you know it
2017-02-22 06:06:41	merkazu	how are you with design from copy? If I gave you what Emily put together, you think you'd be able to do some mockups then translate that into html/css or is the latter portion more your forte?
2017-02-22 06:07:32	merkazu	you indicated a preference for front-end dev/ui design
2017-02-22 08:59:28	keveloper	I could do a mockup from those for sure. When I do mockups though I typically just start with an actual webpage rather than a psd or something
2017-02-22 08:59:51	merkazu	that's completely fine
2017-02-22 09:00:16	keveloper	It's for a home page right?
2017-02-22 09:00:31	keveloper	err, landing :P
2017-02-22 09:00:34	merkazu	not a home page per se, a sell page
2017-02-22 09:00:55	merkazu	click funnel, landing page, whatever you want to call it
2017-02-22 09:01:20	keveloper	Yeah I could do that, I enjoy making landing pages
2017-02-22 09:08:19	merkazu	good, good, once emily gets back to me with the final document, i'll hand that over to you for a quote
2017-02-22 09:08:30	merkazu	unless you can start quoting based on what she's seen
2017-02-22 09:08:36	merkazu	s/seen/shared
2017-02-22 09:15:02	keveloper	Do you have a tagline yet?
2017-02-22 09:16:04	keveloper	I'm also out of town Friday the 24th until Sunday the 5th so I could start when I get back
2017-02-22 09:21:59	merkazu	going on vacation with emily?
2017-02-22 09:22:19	merkazu	no tag line, no logo yet
2017-02-22 09:22:30	keveloper	Yeah we're going to iceland \o/
2017-02-22 09:22:46	merkazu	ooh, enjoy the greenery up there
2017-02-22 09:23:03	keveloper	haha, there's a lot of snow there right now it looks awesome
2017-02-22 09:23:11	merkazu	where in iceland? been thinking about visiting for a while but i don't now where'd be good
2017-02-22 09:23:46	keveloper	We have an apartment in Reykjavik through airbnb
2017-02-22 09:23:54	keveloper	Then we are travelling around the country a bit
2017-02-22 09:24:04	keveloper	It's pretty small, not much bigger than Ohio I think
2017-02-22 09:24:15	keveloper	One night we are staying in a hostile on the other side of iceland
2017-02-22 09:25:50	merkazu	a hostile!
2017-02-22 09:26:05	merkazu	hostels sounds pretty interesting
2017-02-22 09:26:30	keveloper	Looool hostel sorry
2017-02-22 09:26:40	merkazu	i've also been giving some thought to travelling to norway
2017-02-22 09:26:48	merkazu	i'm 16% viking by blood
2017-02-22 09:26:50	keveloper	My sister went there it looks awesome
2017-02-22 09:27:38	keveloper	I really want to drive on the atlantic road

2017-03-06 10:14:41	merkazu	oh wow, you could see the AB from there
2017-03-06 10:15:09	keveloper	the AB?
2017-03-06 10:15:12	merkazu	that looks really really fun!
2017-03-06 10:15:30	merkazu	aurora borealis, the green patterns in the sky at night
2017-03-06 10:15:41	keveloper	Oh yeah they were amazing
2017-03-06 10:15:45	keveloper	saw them three different times
2017-03-06 10:15:56	keveloper	Never seen that abbreviation :P
2017-03-08 14:30:36	keveloper	Hey any word on the upcoming front end work?
2017-03-08 14:34:17	merkazu	mostly waiting for emily to finish up the copy
2017-03-08 14:34:39	merkazu	once that's done, i'll hand it over to you for design/dev
2017-03-08 14:34:43	keveloper	Okay cool
2017-03-08 14:34:59	keveloper	I know she's been working on it, she's sick right now though so that's probably slowing her down :/
2017-03-08 14:35:24	merkazu	bummer, must be the shift between iceland environment and US environment
2017-03-08 14:35:38	keveloper	Yeah maybe, I've been waking up at like 6:15am everyday without an alarm haha
2017-03-08 14:35:42	merkazu	travel tends to get people sick
2017-03-08 14:36:02	keveloper	That's my first time traveling internationally and boy is that stressful haha
2017-03-08 14:36:07	keveloper	JFK is the worst
2017-03-08 14:36:11	merkazu	oh for sure
2017-03-08 14:36:24	merkazu	had to go through o'hare's when i went to italy as a wee one
2017-03-08 14:36:54	keveloper	Our flight to Iceland was ridiculous
2017-03-08 14:37:35	keveloper	CMH -> La Guardia, shuttle in rush hour to JFK. JFK to KEF
2017-03-08 14:37:50	keveloper	our connecting flights were out of diffferent airports -_-
2017-03-08 14:37:57	keveloper	That got rescheduled after we bought our ticket
2017-03-08 14:42:52	merkazu	ew
2017-03-08 14:43:54	keveloper	yap
2017-03-08 14:52:23	merkazu	hmm, there's some other things i may be able to have you work on. might not be as fun as landing pages but they're UI, specifically, exams/knowledge check components. one of them is a match the elements type of thing, most likely drag and drop
2017-03-08 14:53:13	merkazu	and would you, by chance, know an devops type person?
2017-03-08 14:55:35	keveloper	Sounds fun, and no don't think so
2017-03-08 14:57:03	merkazu	that's allright, i think i've got things thought through as far as deployment automation goes
2017-03-08 14:57:57	merkazu	do need to stress test the instances after finishing the codebase. if it's anything like GothAlice's Webcore applications, i should be able to handle pretty high activity on minimal space
2017-03-08 15:03:50	keveloper	whats your dbms
2017-03-08 15:37:57	merkazu	DBMS, most likely mongodb
2017-03-08 15:39:10	merkazu	need to figure out the drivers interaction on my local instance. if i can't get it working, i'll just use mysql
2017-03-08 15:39:21	merkazu	or postgres if clever cloud has it, i think it does
2017-03-08 15:39:49	merkazu	yeah, it has postgres
2017-03-08 16:14:01	keveloper	cool cool
2017-03-08 16:14:22	keveloper	let me know about the UI work, excited for it. I'm gettin off for the day
2017-03-09 07:42:42	merkazu	hey kevin, i'm going to plan on putting together a handful of sketches for you. Mostly exams/knowledge checks type of things. I'll probably have most of them digitized to hand over Saturday morning. based on those, would you be able to provide a quote for what's been shown?
2017-03-09 07:52:29	keveloper	Yeah that sounds fine
2017-03-11 22:43:30	<--	merkazu (~merkazu@104.236.217.197) has quit (*.net *.split)
2017-03-11 22:49:42	-->	merkazu (~merkazu@104.236.217.197) is back on server
2017-03-14 12:10:41	keveloper	Can you elaborate on the responsive notes in the pdf you sent me?
2017-03-14 12:13:31	merkazu	the little thing about the knowledge check section?
2017-03-14 12:13:41	keveloper	yeah the top right
2017-03-14 12:14:14	merkazu	basically the same deal as the sidebar you did for me, just from the right side instead of the left
2017-03-14 12:15:37	merkazu	just need the knowledge check thing to slip under whatever content there is in the middle if it shrinks below a certain point, can't recall off the top of my head what that point was
2017-03-14 12:16:14	merkazu	this'll be all contained within the display page itself so you don't need to worry about taking the sidebar into account for stack order
2017-03-14 12:25:54	keveloper	Okay sounds good
2017-03-14 12:26:02	keveloper	I sent you a quote
2017-03-14 12:26:35	merkazu	thanks, I'll look at it when i head back for lunch
2017-03-14 12:26:47	keveloper	Cool. Looking forward to doing this work :D
2017-03-14 12:26:54	keveloper	Also excited for the landing page
2017-03-14 12:27:02	keveloper	What do you think of Emily's content?
2017-03-14 12:27:55	merkazu	good, it's what i need, I'll hand that over to you in short order as well
2017-03-14 12:28:13	keveloper	Cool

2017-03-21 22:58:19	keveloper	Hey I have a suggestion for your multiple choice feedback: http://i.imgur.com/xKAaO8V.png
2017-03-21 22:58:40	merkazu	works for me
2017-03-21 22:58:44	keveloper	Cool
2017-03-21 22:58:55	keveloper	It was much cleaner than with the circles
2017-03-21 22:59:40	keveloper	Here is during test: http://i.imgur.com/gsZ6B5z.png
2017-03-21 22:59:52	keveloper	How is that?
2017-03-21 23:00:50	merkazu	that's good. Although, if possible, could you get the column to line up with the text?
2017-03-21 23:01:17	keveloper	You mean shift the options over the right a bit?
2017-03-21 23:01:22	merkazu	aye
2017-03-21 23:01:24	keveloper	Yep
2017-03-21 23:02:30	keveloper	http://i.imgur.com/H40xd9W.png
2017-03-21 23:02:47	merkazu	looks good
2017-03-21 23:03:22	keveloper	I think I'm gonna take off some spacing between the first option and the question
2017-03-21 23:03:23	keveloper	Agree?
2017-03-21 23:03:51	merkazu	approximately...2-4px?
2017-03-21 23:04:57	keveloper	Something like that :P
2017-03-21 23:05:12	merkazu	go for it
2017-03-21 23:05:22	keveloper	While you're on here I'll show you this really quickly also
2017-03-21 23:06:00	keveloper	http://i.imgur.com/TowaHgN.png
2017-03-21 23:06:26	keveloper	Thoughts?
2017-03-21 23:07:12	merkazu	i do like that. what's the formatting like for longer sets of feedback?
2017-03-21 23:07:44	keveloper	Haven't done that yet, but it should wrap to under the word argentina
2017-03-21 23:07:58	merkazu	that's what i was hoping :)
2017-03-21 23:08:10	keveloper	I'll make note of that (it doesn't do that currently)
2017-03-21 23:09:16	keveloper	http://i.imgur.com/6jdSWkZ.png
2017-03-21 23:09:19	keveloper	Yeah pretty bad currently
2017-03-21 23:09:32	keveloper	I'll clean it up of course :P
2017-03-21 23:09:50	keveloper	What do you think of the box shadow on the input? Yay or nay?
2017-03-21 23:10:18	keveloper	I'm trying to incorporate material design aspects where I can but I figure you don't want full material design
2017-03-21 23:10:57	merkazu	pardon, my definition of box shadow might be a little outdated. it just looks like a border to me
2017-03-21 23:11:17	keveloper	There's a slight shadow right around the border
2017-03-21 23:11:39	merkazu	go for it
2017-03-21 23:11:49	keveloper	If you don't notice it then great :P I did it right lol
2017-03-21 23:12:19	merkazu	yeah, i got it blown up to probably 400x and still didn't notice
2017-03-21 23:12:27	merkazu	400%
2017-03-21 23:12:38	keveloper	You can tell if you sit there and toggle the shadow attribute lol :P
2017-03-21 23:12:46	merkazu	true
2017-03-21 23:12:55	keveloper	The closer you look the harder it is to see lol
2017-03-21 23:17:02	merkazu	i'll kip for the night soon, anything else before i go?
2017-03-21 23:20:21	keveloper	Nope that was it
2017-03-21 23:20:32	merkazu	allright, good night
2017-03-21 23:20:47	keveloper	night, talk to to you tomorrow most likely
2017-04-03 07:26:25	keveloper	Hey, I'll finish up the UI stuff this week. Last week was a mess and just spent all weekend moving so I haven't worked on it in a bit
2017-04-03 07:26:38	merkazu	that's cool
2017-04-03 07:26:54	merkazu	this past week has been kinda nutters for me too
2017-04-03 07:27:57	keveloper	I just want a week of nothing to do  :'O
2017-04-03 07:28:33	merkazu	no PTO?
2017-04-03 07:28:54	keveloper	I have PTO but not a ton because of the iceland trip h aha
2017-04-03 07:29:01	merkazu	oh, true
2017-04-03 07:29:32	keveloper	Ayy I have 40 hours though, I didn't even realize lol
2017-04-03 07:29:46	keveloper	75 hours of sick time, not sure what I'm ever gonna do with that lol
2017-04-03 07:30:00	merkazu	spring fever, man
2017-04-03 07:30:04	keveloper	Guess i just need to get sick more
2017-04-03 07:30:18	keveloper	I think hang overs count as being sick right?
2017-04-03 07:30:19	keveloper	:P
2017-04-03 07:30:24	merkazu	hehe
2017-04-03 07:32:10	merkazu	i ended up having like 30 some hours of sick time towards the end of last year
2017-04-03 07:32:39	merkazu	took sporadic wednesdays off to burn it because carry over was only like 5 hours
2017-04-03 07:34:13	merkazu	did you know my coworker is leaving today?
2017-04-03 07:39:26	keveloper	I did not
2017-04-03 07:39:38	keveloper	I think you I saw you talk about him quitting a couple weeks ago actually
2017-04-03 07:39:59	merkazu	yeah, gave his notice two weeks ago
2017-04-03 07:40:10	keveloper	Yeah I think I remember that
2017-04-03 07:40:21	merkazu	so it's down to me to do all of the development work, at least until tomorrow
2017-04-03 07:40:34	keveloper	Sounds like a great time :P
2017-04-03 07:40:45	merkazu	tomorrow, i've got an assistant, pure email developer
2017-04-03 07:40:50	merkazu	temp though
2017-04-03 07:40:59	keveloper	pure email developer? lol
2017-04-03 07:41:09	merkazu	yeah, hence why it's temp
2017-04-03 07:41:17	merkazu	i wouldn't wish that on anyone long term
2017-04-03 07:41:54	merkazu	we're looking to renegotiate contracts next year to get us off of a blended rate with our client who sends all of these emails
2017-04-03 07:42:22	merkazu	once that's been done, the designers will be using mailchimp's email editor to build their emails :)
2017-04-03 07:44:20	merkazu	i'm also going to see about what i can do to eliminate the maintenance development portion of my job as well
2017-04-03 07:44:29	merkazu	that'll be fun ;)
2017-04-03 07:47:02	keveloper	getting rid of all the shit you dont wanna do lol
2017-04-03 07:47:10	merkazu	aye
2017-04-03 07:47:16	keveloper	i need to do that (but i cant) ('-')
2017-04-03 07:48:04	merkazu	don't do what you can delegate, don't delegate what you can automate, don't automate what you can get rid of entirely
2017-04-03 07:48:17	keveloper	working on getting a promotion right now though so I hope that happens
2017-04-03 07:48:25	merkazu	to what?
2017-04-03 07:48:33	merkazu	senior sdev?
2017-04-03 07:48:37	keveloper	software engineer
2017-04-03 07:49:00	keveloper	ours goes software dev -> software engineer -> senior software engineer -> consulting software engineer
2017-04-03 07:51:01	merkazu	i take it that software engineer's a little more involved in feature development rather than support?
2017-04-03 07:51:18	keveloper	uhh nope...
2017-04-03 07:51:22	keveloper	pretty much the same thing
2017-04-03 07:51:36	keveloper	i do way more than one of our consulting software engineers so
2017-04-03 07:52:19	keveloper	there are also tech leads but they do way less coding and way more meeting so no thank you
2017-04-03 07:52:58	merkazu	haha
2017-04-03 07:53:07	merkazu	i'm totally up for more meetings tbh
2017-04-03 07:53:45	keveloper	i dont hate them as much as some but i do like actually doing things :P
2017-04-03 07:55:03	merkazu	true, i find meetings useful for rapidly shifting the horrible initial concepting of said project from upper management and account services into something that's actually feasible for us or a sub-contracted agency to do
2017-04-03 07:56:07	merkazu	like this one last week, i was brought in two days prior to us presenting to our sub-contracted agency. they'd have seriously WTF'd at AS's initial concept
2017-04-03 07:56:37	keveloper	who are your clients
2017-04-03 07:56:40	keveloper	what industry
2017-04-03 07:57:10	merkazu	let's make a campaign about not wasting the consumer's time... by redirecting them to different places on a non-mobile optimized website with many endpoints that require further interaction to even reach what you want
2017-04-03 07:57:21	merkazu	i work in marketing and advertising
2017-04-03 08:00:13	keveloper	ah okay
2017-04-03 08:00:17	keveloper	You've told me that before -_-
2017-04-03 08:00:21	keveloper	my memory is bad
2017-04-03 08:00:26	merkazu	no worries
2017-04-03 08:00:33	keveloper	Too many concussions :o
2017-04-03 08:00:44	keveloper	(Not sure if that is why but... can't help lol)
2017-04-03 08:00:47	merkazu	sportsing it up a bit much there?
2017-04-03 08:00:54	keveloper	Snowboarding lol
2017-04-03 08:01:04	keveloper	I did competitive snowboarding
2017-04-03 08:01:08	keveloper	Park stuff, jumps rails
2017-04-07 08:02:12	keveloper	Hey you on yet?
2017-04-07 10:41:25	keveloper	Hellooo
2017-04-07 10:41:34	merkazu	sup
2017-04-07 10:41:47	keveloper	So for the drag and drop stuff I'm looking into using dragula.js
2017-04-07 10:41:55	keveloper	Considering canvas would be overkill
2017-04-07 10:42:11	keveloper	And html5 drag and drop isn't well supported
2017-04-07 10:42:16	keveloper	And has a bloated api
2017-04-07 10:42:22	keveloper	Is that cool?
2017-04-07 10:42:46	keveloper	dragula is very clean and easy to use, i started fleshing it out last night to make sure it will work well
2017-04-07 10:42:56	keveloper	Also will quizzes/knowledge check stuff be available on mobile?
2017-04-07 10:43:06	merkazu	expected to, yes
2017-04-07 10:43:13	keveloper	What your preferred approach for the matching questions on mobile
2017-04-07 10:43:28	keveloper	Drag and drop on mobile might be finnicky
2017-04-07 10:43:59	merkazu	what do you feel is the best approach for that?
2017-04-07 10:44:30	keveloper	That's a good question
2017-04-07 10:44:34	keveloper	I could try to think of a fallback
2017-04-07 10:44:38	merkazu	and i'm fine with you using dragula as long as you include the source with the files you hand over to me
2017-04-07 10:44:47	keveloper	Yeah I'm not using any CDNs
2017-04-07 10:45:06	keveloper	(Oh just kidding lied, I'm using font-awesome cdn for their js, but i can get it locallly)
2017-04-07 10:45:44	merkazu	my initial thoughts with drag and drop questions on mobile would be click pairs
2017-04-07 10:45:48	keveloper	But yeah dragula is pretty cool, very easy to use and it will get the job done
2017-04-07 10:45:52	keveloper	Yeah I was also thinking that
2017-04-07 10:46:08	keveloper	Drag and drop was your intent with the matching right?
2017-04-07 10:46:16	merkazu	aye
2017-04-07 10:46:20	keveloper	Cool
2017-04-07 10:46:31	keveloper	Using html5's drag and drop looks like such a pain -_-
2017-04-07 10:46:33	merkazu	found something on ux.stackexchange
2017-04-07 10:46:38	keveloper	link?
2017-04-07 10:46:41	merkazu	http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/20092/is-it-a-good-user-experience-to-have-drag-and-drop-in-tablet-apps
2017-04-07 10:47:34	keveloper	I can make the sure the snapping areas are big enough
2017-04-07 10:47:52	keveloper	And close enough to the values to match
2017-04-07 10:48:05	keveloper	I'll obviously test on local and let you know if I experience issues
2017-04-07 10:49:09	keveloper	/s/local/mobile
2017-04-07 10:49:35	merkazu	sure, and if you think of anything better for the smaller phones, let me know
2017-04-07 10:50:20	keveloper	Sure thing
2017-04-07 10:50:43	keveloper	Had some fun fighting firefox with the fill in the blank stuff yesterday -_-
2017-04-07 10:50:52	merkazu	yikes
2017-04-07 10:51:01	keveloper	It's a-okay now lol
2017-04-07 10:51:17	keveloper	I'll make sure to test on edge and IE11
2017-04-07 10:51:23	keveloper	Do you want IE10?
2017-04-07 10:52:07	merkazu	the assumption was modern browsers. if it works in IE10, cool, if it doesn't, NBD
2017-04-07 10:52:18	keveloper	That's what I thought
2017-04-07 10:52:33	keveloper	I should be able to finish by Monday
2017-04-07 10:52:42	keveloper	Sorry about the delay, last 2 weeks were *crazy(
2017-04-07 10:52:44	keveloper	*crazy*
2017-04-07 10:52:48	keveloper	Also I can't type anymore -_-
2017-04-07 10:52:56	merkazu	sounds good, it's cool
2017-04-07 10:53:19	keveloper	The new apartment is soo sick tho :')

2017-04-07 10:54:03	keveloper	1,660 sq/ft for $1365
2017-04-07 10:54:40	keveloper	Brand new renovation, wood floors, huge living room. Two floors, two baths, two bedrooms, den (comptuer room ayoo), big kitchen w/ stainless steel applicanes
2017-04-07 10:54:43	keveloper	Sooo happy lol
2017-04-07 10:55:01	keveloper	Let's be real though most of my time will be spent in the computer room though lol
2017-04-07 10:57:40	merkazu	haha
2017-04-07 14:11:15	merkazu	under a dollar a square foot per month, living the life, mate
2017-04-07 14:12:39	keveloper	Ikr
2017-04-07 14:12:43	keveloper	We are currently at a dollar
2017-04-07 14:12:47	keveloper	Well our previous place
2017-04-07 14:12:55	keveloper	A week ago we were at a dollar per sq ft
2017-04-07 14:13:22	merkazu	i'm currently at about two
2017-04-07 14:14:06	keveloper	Sheesh
2017-04-07 14:15:08	merkazu	but depending on how things go at work, i may look into either switching over to a 2br apartment at probably a dollar a square foot or buying a <100k house
2017-04-07 14:16:11	keveloper	You're in Iowa right?
2017-04-07 14:16:23	merkazu	aye
2017-04-07 14:16:25	keveloper	Is the cost of living bad where you are?
2017-04-07 14:16:30	merkazu	82.70
2017-04-07 14:16:38	merkazu	average is 100
2017-04-07 14:16:50	keveloper	Ah okay.. I think columbus is about that
2017-04-07 14:16:54	keveloper	Or maybe a little less idk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-04-07 14:17:09	merkazu	rental market's heating up a fair bit around here with the influx of milennials
2017-04-07 14:18:32	keveloper	damn millenials ('-')

2017-04-12 09:41:34	keveloper	Like in US?
2017-04-12 09:41:43	merkazu	thinking i should probably try to get something going so i don't burn myself out here because my next planned vacation is in december
2017-04-12 09:41:50	merkazu	yes, that's the definition of domestic
2017-04-12 09:42:07	keveloper	that's what I thought I just figured the answer is obviously yes lol
2017-04-12 09:42:25	keveloper	Yeah though
2017-04-12 09:42:34	merkazu	where did you go? hunting for ideas
2017-04-12 09:42:38	keveloper	Key west is sweet
2017-04-12 09:42:58	keveloper	I like chicago and NYC as far as city trips go
2017-04-12 09:43:23	keveloper	South myrtle beach, SC if you like beaches
2017-04-12 09:43:41	keveloper	used to go to a cool place called Ocean Creek there, pretty cool resort
2017-04-12 09:44:04	keveloper	There's some pretty vacant beaches north and sount of myrtle beach to avoid crouds though
2017-04-12 09:44:07	merkazu	one of the ideas i had was star parties in texas
2017-04-12 09:44:08	keveloper	Surfside beach is one
2017-04-12 09:44:15	keveloper	Yeah that'd be sweet
2017-04-12 09:44:37	keveloper	The key between key west and mainland florida is good for star watching
2017-04-12 09:45:15	keveloper	The furthest west i've been is texas though
2017-04-12 09:45:48	merkazu	ocean creek does look nice
2017-04-12 09:46:04	keveloper	Yeah... I wanna go there with emily
2017-04-12 09:46:12	keveloper	The beach can get crowded in mid summer though so bleh
2017-04-12 09:46:31	keveloper	Surfside beach is cool because there's like nobody there (at least when I went... mid may i think?)
2017-04-12 09:46:43	merkazu	yeah, i'm thinking it'll probably be mid-may if i did go somewhere in the short term
2017-04-12 09:46:48	keveloper	But yeah beaches are kinda whatever
2017-04-12 09:47:02	keveloper	I haven't been many cool places in the US
2017-04-12 09:47:10	merkazu	likewise, haha
2017-04-12 09:47:17	merkazu	been to chicago a few times
2017-04-12 09:47:18	keveloper	Acadia National Park in maine looks sweet
2017-04-12 09:47:22	keveloper	my friend went recently
2017-04-12 09:47:31	keveloper	emily is obssessed with glacier national park in montana
2017-04-12 09:47:50	merkazu	also considering cinci because i've got some relatives in the same industry up there
2017-04-17 09:02:45	keveloper	Hey update on UI stuff:
2017-04-17 09:03:14	keveloper	Should be a done in a day or so. The drag and drop stuff took a while to get right and I'm still messing with the styling and responsiveness
2017-04-17 09:03:41	keveloper	I have some touch up stuff to do on other elements and I may refactor/clean up some SCSS, so Tuesday night seems right
2017-04-17 09:04:48	merkazu	sounds good
2017-04-17 09:04:56	keveloper	Sorry for the delay :/
2017-04-17 09:05:03	merkazu	nah, it's cool
2017-04-17 09:05:13	merkazu	trying to get back on track myself
2017-04-17 09:05:24	keveloper	The drag and drop component took like 3 attempts to get right
2017-04-17 09:05:29	keveloper	Just kept deleting it and starting over
2017-04-17 09:05:35	merkazu	yikes
2017-04-17 09:05:44	merkazu	what was blowing up on them?
2017-04-17 09:06:43	keveloper	Just matching the width and height of all of the values/keys/fill spaces
2017-04-17 09:06:48	keveloper	And on resizing and what not
2017-04-17 09:07:07	keveloper	Making sure long value fit in the boxes
2017-04-17 09:07:09	keveloper	Etc. etc.
2017-04-17 09:07:28	keveloper	I made the mistake of trying to do it with table at first
2017-04-17 09:08:02	keveloper	I was like "oh there are three columns, values, fills, and keys, this is a good use for table; nope that did not work well -_-
2017-04-25 08:40:38	keveloper	Hey, so I _finally_ found something that looks good for the match/drag-n-drop feature so I should be getting it to you tonight
2017-04-25 08:40:59	keveloper	I kept fiddling with it and nothing ever looked right and I wanted it to look as good as possible obviously so. I hope you'
2017-04-25 08:41:12	keveloper	I hope you'll like my solution, I think it looks quite nice
2017-04-25 08:41:34	keveloper	I did a lot of research also to find out what other match question look like in other software/webapps
2017-04-25 08:42:02	keveloper	I can send you a screenshot also if you want before I work on responsiveness tonight
2017-04-25 09:03:25	merkazu	Sure thing, thanks for the hard work!
2017-04-25 09:04:00	merkazu	did you talk to GothAlice about her project she needed help on? Figured it'd be something you'd want to take on
2017-04-25 09:05:05	keveloper	I haven't yet, I don't know if I'm going to
2017-04-25 09:05:10	keveloper	Is the landing page thing still happening?
2017-04-25 09:05:12	keveloper	Also: http://i.imgur.com/RxfZou8.png
2017-04-25 09:07:01	merkazu	hmm
2017-04-25 09:07:51	merkazu	If you decide to not take on GothAlice's project, I'll give you the landing page to occupy your time after you turn in the questions project
2017-04-25 09:08:12	merkazu	trying to not overwhelm you, especially with all you have going on at work
2017-04-25 09:08:25	keveloper	Yeah work is kind of stressful at the moment -_-
2017-04-25 09:09:00	merkazu	yeah, i figured.
2017-04-25 09:09:13	keveloper	What do you think of the match design?
2017-04-25 09:20:22	merkazu	How does the right side of the matching work if it's a sentence for example?
2017-04-25 09:20:59	keveloper	It would just fill the rest of the width then wrap. Vertically centered always lined up with the dash
2017-04-25 09:21:24	keveloper	I cropped it in the image
2017-04-25 09:21:30	keveloper	there's more space to the right on the actual page
2017-04-25 09:21:42	keveloper	I also I might change the font size
2017-04-25 09:21:52	keveloper	That's the general idea of it though
2017-04-25 09:22:46	merkazu	aight, sounds good
2017-04-25 09:23:07	keveloper	I tried the one drew up quite a few ways and it never looked great. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-04-25 09:23:22	keveloper	The best looking ones I found elsewhere all had a similar look to the one I thought up
2017-04-25 09:26:28	merkazu	cool
2017-04-25 09:26:41	keveloper	As long as you like it
2017-04-26 19:07:38	keveloper	Hey I sent you the UI components
2017-04-26 19:08:00	keveloper	I had to send a drive link because apparently .js files are now considered malicious by gmail :P
2017-04-26 19:09:41	merkazu	haha
2017-04-26 19:09:53	merkazu	i'll take a look later tonight
2017-04-26 20:49:27	merkazu	looks great, three things I want to point out
2017-04-26 20:49:51	merkazu	in question 4, the X and the check are abnormally higher than they should be
2017-04-26 20:52:28	merkazu	in question 7, i'm not a fan of variable length match areas. Would it be possible to just make it a two column format, the draggable area taking up 50% of the width and the answer area taking up the other 50%?
2017-04-26 20:53:00	merkazu	that'd address the third thing where sufficiently long strings like chemical formulas may cause the draggable area to become super tiny
2017-04-26 20:54:15	merkazu	i really do like the icons and the hover effect in the related materials section, nice job on that
2017-04-26 20:55:07	merkazu	i'll copy over all my feedback into a response so you don't need to worry about losing the query
2017-04-26 21:00:49	keveloper	Okay sounds good
2017-04-27 19:36:36	keveloper	i sent you the fixes
2017-04-27 19:37:24	keveloper	I changed the multiple choice to a list (it wasnt at first) and it changed the alignment of the x and checkmark haha oops :O
2017-04-27 19:37:32	keveloper	Let me know if you find anything else
2017-04-27 19:39:49	merkazu	good work, job complete :)
2017-04-29 13:33:21	keveloper	a telephone pole got struck by lighting a block from our apt so we have no internet haha. im going to a coffee shop today and i should be able to make/send an invoice then
2017-04-29 14:11:41	keveloper	Send :D
2017-04-29 15:32:06	merkazu	oh wow
2017-04-29 15:32:26	merkazu	it's normally flooding that takes out our internet around here
2017-04-29 15:32:32	merkazu	we're a bit close to a river bank
2017-04-29 15:33:03	merkazu	hmm, you wanted a check?
2017-04-29 16:01:17	merkazu	oh well, paid
2017-04-30 02:01:57	keveloper	Yeah, still no internet at home -_-   
2017-04-30 02:02:30	keveloper	Yeah I wanted a check but no big deal ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  I should've said something in IRC
2017-05-01 12:27:44	keveloper	Hey you there?
2017-05-01 12:40:39	merkazu	sup?
2017-05-01 12:40:46	merkazu	got out of a meeting
2017-05-01 12:41:36	keveloper	I'm working on the project/work section of my portfolio right now. Could I put Lugh in here? It would just be a screenshot and and a name/description. "LughLMS. A UI design for a startup LMS" or something like that
2017-05-01 12:41:43	keveloper	Or I can leave out the name?
2017-05-01 12:42:24	keveloper	http://imgur.com/a/tFDyF
2017-05-01 12:42:36	keveloper	It looks like that. Second pic is on hover
2017-05-01 14:13:15	keveloper	Sorry I was offline for a bit
2017-05-01 14:14:02	merkazu	that's cool
2017-05-01 14:14:12	merkazu	you're free to use Lugh for portfolio purposes
2017-05-01 14:14:37	keveloper	How should I style the name? LughLMS?
2017-05-01 14:14:45	merkazu	yeah
2017-05-01 14:15:00	keveloper	heres the portfolio by the way: https://kholland950.github.io/portfolio/src/#
2017-05-01 14:15:03	keveloper	what do you think?
2017-05-01 14:16:34	merkazu	looks good
2017-05-01 14:16:44	keveloper	Thanks :D
2017-05-01 14:16:52	keveloper	temporary url btw lol
2017-05-08 14:41:14	keveloper	I'll get that quote to you in the next few days
2017-05-08 14:41:32	keveloper	Today or tomorrow most likely
2017-05-08 14:41:53	merkazu	aight cool
2017-05-10 11:28:06	keveloper	Hey what kind of timeline do you have for this landing page?
2017-05-10 11:28:51	merkazu	mmm, end of june maybe?
2017-05-10 11:29:21	merkazu	what do you feel is reasonable for this type of work?
2017-05-10 11:29:28	keveloper	End of june sounds good
2017-05-10 11:29:39	merkazu	cool
2017-05-14 14:09:21	<--	merkazu (~merkazu@unaffiliated/merkazu) has quit (*.net *.split)
2017-05-14 15:28:59	-->	merkazu (~merkazu@znc.webcore.io) is back on server
2017-05-14 16:26:45	<--	merkazu (~merkazu@znc.webcore.io) has quit (Changing host)
2017-05-14 16:26:46	-->	merkazu (~merkazu@unaffiliated/merkazu) is back on server
2017-05-17 16:40:33	keveloper	Hey you there?
2017-05-17 16:40:42	merkazu	of course
2017-05-17 16:41:02	keveloper	So sorry about the delay with the quote, was waiting for time to actually put thought into it -_-
2017-05-17 16:41:04	keveloper	Can you talk now?
2017-05-17 16:41:11	merkazu	yeah
2017-05-17 16:41:20	keveloper	I figured we could talk it over before I send you any actual quote via email
2017-05-17 16:41:30	merkazu	sure
2017-05-17 16:41:32	keveloper	Cool
2017-05-17 16:42:13	keveloper	So you want a not fully functional page (meaning minimal js), professional looking, responsive, accessible landing page correct?
2017-05-17 16:42:19	keveloper	Matching similar design points from previous material
2017-05-17 16:43:03	keveloper	Semantic/well written HTML/SCSS for an entire page with header/footer, and 5 more sections?
2017-05-17 16:43:14	merkazu	aye, i don't actually think any javascript is needed unless you're planning on doing something special design wise
2017-05-17 16:43:26	keveloper	Yeah I figured, probably not no
2017-05-17 16:43:31	keveloper	Maybe if I do a sticky header
2017-05-17 16:43:37	keveloper	css sticky really isn't support
2017-05-17 16:43:38	keveloper	ed
2017-05-17 16:43:44	merkazu	fair
2017-05-17 16:44:20	keveloper	Do you have a logo?
2017-05-17 16:44:23	merkazu	and you don't need to worry about real links, just use # and i'll handle that later
2017-05-17 16:44:26	keveloper	Cool
2017-05-17 16:44:28	merkazu	that, i do not
2017-05-17 16:44:36	keveloper	Okay I can just use a placeholder for now
2017-05-17 16:44:38	merkazu	interested or know someone who might be?
2017-05-17 16:44:49	keveloper	Capable of making a good logo?
2017-05-17 16:44:52	merkazu	aye
2017-05-17 16:45:05	keveloper	Yeah I know a graphic design guy on irc lemme see if he has a portfolio
2017-05-17 16:45:13	merkazu	cool
2017-05-17 16:45:47	keveloper	I think he's afk rn, I'll get back to you on that
2017-05-17 16:45:55	merkazu	sounds good
2017-05-17 16:46:30	keveloper	So is the introduction the header?
2017-05-17 16:46:50	keveloper	Or will there be a slogan or headline
2017-05-17 16:46:59	keveloper	Otherwise I can put dummy content in 
2017-05-17 16:47:22	keveloper	Just trying to figure out if this is Header + Footer + 6 sections, or 5 sections
2017-05-17 16:47:53	merkazu	let's do dummy, assuming there'll be a headline/tagline I'll get from Emily
2017-05-17 16:47:59	keveloper	Cool
2017-05-17 16:48:09	keveloper	She just got a job btw \o/\o/\o/
2017-05-17 16:48:11	keveloper	Fulltime I mean
2017-05-17 16:48:16	keveloper	Heard yesterday :D
2017-05-17 16:48:19	merkazu	oh yeah? where at?
2017-05-17 16:48:23	keveloper	CoverMyMeds in columbus
2017-05-17 16:48:28	keveloper	Doing... idk account management or something?
2017-05-17 16:48:32	merkazu	nice
2017-05-17 16:48:37	keveloper	Ya super excited :D
2017-05-17 16:48:37	keveloper	Anyway
2017-05-17 16:49:08	keveloper	So i'm thinking this will be about 50 hours of work
2017-05-17 16:49:14	keveloper	I'm not sure a better way to estimate cost on this
2017-05-17 16:49:40	merkazu	hours is fine, what's your rate?
2017-05-17 16:50:05	keveloper	35/hour
2017-05-17 16:50:11	keveloper	If that's too high, obviously negotiable
2017-05-17 16:51:39	merkazu	so $1750 for the project. That's including the design and development, is this correct?
2017-05-17 16:51:47	keveloper	Yes
2017-05-17 16:52:00	keveloper	Full design/development/revisions
2017-05-17 16:52:20	keveloper	I'll be interactive with feedback and send you incremental updates and incorporate any feedback you have into the design
2017-05-17 16:52:24	merkazu	billed for revisions?
2017-05-17 16:52:42	keveloper	I'd say no currently, unless they are large revisions
2017-05-17 16:52:55	keveloper	Can we say TBD? Or are you uncomfortable with that
2017-05-17 16:53:10	merkazu	on that subject, yeah
2017-05-17 16:53:21	keveloper	I think most revisions you'd have shouldn't be billable, but I don't want to say hard no on that
2017-05-17 16:53:39	merkazu	of course, i'll make sure the clause covers that properly
2017-05-17 16:54:11	merkazu	i'll draft up a contract this weekend and send it your way to review and make any necessary revisions
2017-05-17 16:54:22	keveloper	Sounds good. I'm stoked for this project btw ;)
2017-05-17 16:54:34	merkazu	I figured you would be
2017-05-17 16:54:37	keveloper	Hope we can make something really cool
2017-05-17 16:54:42	merkazu	and you can certainly use it as a portfolio piece
2017-05-17 16:54:43	keveloper	Yeah sorry it took so long to get back to you
2017-05-17 16:54:46	keveloper	Thank you
2017-05-17 16:54:48	merkazu	nah, that's cool
2017-05-17 16:55:05	keveloper	I kept worrying about it but I never had to time to really give it thought over the last 5 days -_-
2017-05-17 16:55:13	keveloper	A lot of time freeing up in the next months
2017-05-17 16:55:17	keveloper	Aside from traveling
2017-05-17 16:55:19	merkazu	i'll also push out the deadline to end of july as things will most likely get a bit nutters as I'm transitioning into the new role
2017-05-17 16:55:25	merkazu	going somewhere?
2017-05-17 16:55:32	keveloper	Only chicago by then
2017-05-17 16:55:37	keveloper	August will be vegas/montana
2017-05-17 16:55:44	merkazu	ooh, vegas will be fun
2017-05-17 16:55:53	keveloper	Yeah, bachelor party for my sisters fiance
2017-05-17 16:55:54	merkazu	went there two years ago for ZendCon
2017-05-17 16:56:00	merkazu	Hard Rock Hotel
2017-05-17 16:56:01	keveloper	I've never been
2017-05-17 16:56:08	keveloper	Whatd you think of it
2017-05-17 16:56:28	merkazu	the hotel itself... to be honest, probably not the greatest
2017-05-17 16:56:47	merkazu	furniture had cigarette burns and the room was pretty plain
2017-05-17 16:56:52	keveloper	oh damn lol
2017-05-17 16:57:04	keveloper	We haven't booked hotel yet but I don't think they are looking there
2017-05-17 16:57:04	merkazu	i'd recommend not staying there
2017-05-17 16:57:11	keveloper	Okay I'll keep that in mind haha
2017-05-17 16:57:17	keveloper	Shoot I need to book that flight
2017-05-17 16:57:20	merkazu	the first floor is fun though, loads of exhibits
2017-05-17 16:57:25	keveloper	BTW do you have any bitcoin or altcoin?
2017-05-17 16:57:48	merkazu	mmm, a wallet i had that is most likely sealed away in an old hard drive, why?
2017-05-17 16:58:06	keveloper	Just curious, decided I should buy some today
2017-05-17 16:58:22	keveloper	got $400 of BTC and I'm going to buy some altcoin. Don't know which yet
2017-05-17 16:58:28	merkazu	ah, never really bought much into the concept of cryptocurrency
2017-05-17 16:58:28	keveloper	Figured I'd give it a shot haha
2017-05-17 16:58:40	keveloper	Yeah, I'm completely accepting that I may just loost $400
2017-05-17 16:58:42	merkazu	i like the idea of the blockchain itself, monetary backing, nah
2017-05-17 16:58:43	keveloper	lose*
2017-05-17 16:59:09	keveloper	¯\_(ツ)_/¯   i have a friend that put $300 into BTC in 2009 and now has $180k from it... so
2017-05-17 16:59:16	keveloper	Would be nice :P
2017-05-17 16:59:36	keveloper	Trying my hand at this very risky/sketchy investment idea lol
2017-05-17 16:59:44	keveloper	$400 is w/e though so..
2017-05-17 17:00:03	keveloper	I'll let you know when I hear back from the graphic design friend
2017-05-17 17:00:21	merkazu	yeah, 2009, lol
2017-05-17 17:00:45	merkazu	i feel bad for the dude who paid several thousands of BTC for pizza
2017-05-17 17:00:56	keveloper	I was 14 in 2009 so no wonder I didn't invest :P
2017-05-17 17:01:26	merkazu	sounds good, i'm looking forward to it. I'll also reach out to Emily about that tag line when i'm ready
2017-05-17 17:01:36	keveloper	Cool
2017-05-17 17:34:59	keveloper	Hey he's online, can I just tell him to query merkazu?
2017-05-17 17:35:18	merkazu	i'll be here at work for a bit, go ahead
2017-05-17 17:36:34	keveloper	Okay cool
2017-05-17 17:36:53	keveloper	Here's his behance he sent me https://www.behance.net/iansitko
2017-05-17 17:40:06	merkazu	sirens yay :(
2017-05-17 17:40:40	keveloper	Like an ambulance or
2017-05-17 17:40:43	keveloper	Tornado
2017-06-09 15:16:24	merkazu	speaking of which, how have things been going?
2017-06-09 15:18:06	keveloper	Unfortunately haven't started the landing page yet, starting this weekend
2017-06-09 15:18:17	keveloper	Too many weekend plans recently -_-
2017-06-09 15:18:25	merkazu	yeah, i know how that goes
2017-06-09 15:18:59	merkazu	haven't heard back from that SlabDubs guy since we talked
2017-06-09 15:19:09	merkazu	said he was going to do some research and toss out ideas
2017-06-09 15:45:21	merkazu	by the way, how experienced are you with PHP work?
2017-06-09 15:46:11	merkazu	there's a job i may be pursuing in the next few weeks depending on how the interview goes. the company i'd be leaving may be in a bit of a lurch and in need of additional freelancer support
2017-06-09 15:56:48	keveloper	I've done wordpress PHP for a company
2017-06-09 15:56:53	keveloper	I did some in college
2017-06-09 15:56:55	keveloper	Not really though
2017-06-09 15:57:09	merkazu	hm, we're more regular PHP here
2017-06-09 15:57:11	keveloper	I wrote this theme for them: http://e-lofts.com/
2017-06-09 15:57:15	keveloper	Yeah I hate wordpress
2017-06-09 15:58:01	keveloper	Yeah idk, I asked him if he was gonna do it and can't remember what he said
2017-06-09 15:58:04	keveloper	Oh well ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I tried
2017-06-09 15:58:16	merkazu	it's cool
2017-06-09 15:58:22	keveloper	You can probably find someone better, I wasn't too overwhelmed by his 
2017-06-09 15:58:30	keveloper	uhhh whats it called.... artsy pinterest
2017-06-09 15:58:37	merkazu	snrk
2017-06-09 15:58:42	keveloper	Crap what is that called
2017-06-09 15:59:06	merkazu	https://www.instagram.com/p/BSzHeddABCd/?taken-by=scratchedglasswork
2017-06-09 15:59:09	merkazu	that?
2017-06-09 15:59:33	merkazu	or behance? https://www.behance.net/iansitko
2017-06-09 15:59:39	keveloper	YES thats it lol
2017-06-09 16:00:03	keveloper	I have a friend from college who is quite talented and I think he does logos lemme check if I'm remember correctly
2017-06-09 16:00:07	keveloper	He's a crazy talented designer though
2017-06-09 16:00:52	keveloper	This is his instagram https://www.instagram.com/filmowski/
2017-06-12 11:38:34	<--	merkazu (~merkazu@unaffiliated/merkazu) has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2017-06-12 11:42:30	-->	merkazu (~merkazu@z2017-07-17 12:54:34	merkazu	bummer
2017-07-17 12:54:41	keveloper	what's up
2017-07-17 12:54:55	merkazu	he has to pass because it cuts a bit too much into his territory at the company
2017-07-17 12:55:00	keveloper	agh
2017-07-17 12:55:05	keveloper	He seems pumped about it too
2017-07-17 12:55:13	keveloper	seemed**
2017-07-17 12:55:28	merkazu	yeah. I'll follow up about Anima Analytics as I'd want to launch that quickly too
2017-07-17 12:55:45	keveloper	What is that
2017-07-17 12:57:13	merkazu	Data integration platform
2017-07-17 12:57:42	merkazu	LughLMS only reports on its own stuff. Anima Analytics combines the data from everything and turns it into actionable insights
2017-07-17 12:57:48	keveloper	Ahh okay
2017-07-17 12:58:30	merkazu	kinda like having products built using a kissmetrics like system for itself but can integrate into kissmetrics for business-wide insights
2017-07-17 12:58:53	keveloper	Idk anything about data stuff like this
2017-07-17 12:58:58	keveloper	analytics
2017-07-17 13:00:58	merkazu	Let's say Lugh goes over well, would you also be interested in taking this one on as well?
2017-07-17 13:02:13	keveloper	Yes of course
2017-07-17 13:19:34	merkazu	looking good so far
2017-07-17 13:19:58	merkazu	with the sticky header, is there a bit of a layer under it so it doesn't completely blend into the background?
2017-07-17 13:21:55	merkazu	line-height is a little wonky to me with the links at the bottom
2017-07-17 13:22:13	merkazu	on mobile, i should say
2017-07-17 13:22:38	merkazu	good otherwise, you'll have to show me about the whole bundle thing you're using on this page
2017-07-17 13:24:17	keveloper	There was a box-shadow at some point but that might have been broken in all of  my changes
2017-07-17 13:24:24	keveloper	I was changing colors and themes around to find what looked good
2017-07-17 13:24:40	keveloper	Will look into the line-height thing
2017-07-17 13:24:54	keveloper	What about the bundle thing?
2017-07-17 14:01:27	merkazu	you have a file being requested by the site, bundle.js
2017-07-17 14:01:46	merkazu	figured it was something like webpack producing rather than codekit
2017-07-17 14:02:17	keveloper	Oh right, I won't deliver it like that this is just my dev env
2017-07-17 14:02:33	merkazu	aha, okay
2017-07-17 14:02:43	merkazu	i'll still want SCSS files though, those are helpful
2017-07-17 19:20:07	keveloper	You there?
2017-07-17 19:47:15	merkazu	hm?
2017-07-17 19:47:50	keveloper	Hey, what was the line-height thing you were talking about?
2017-07-17 19:48:09	keveloper	The line-height is intentionally smaller so that when the links wrap you can differentiate between links
2017-07-17 19:48:35	merkazu	oh yeah, if you shrink the screen width enough that some of the links wrap around on mobile sizes, the line-height seems a bit funky to me
2017-07-17 19:50:01	merkazu	adjusting it to 20px makes me happy
2017-07-17 19:50:10	merkazu	from its current 16px
2017-07-17 19:50:49	keveloper	It's at 1em, I changed it to 1.25em
2017-07-17 19:50:56	keveloper	That's 16px->20px right?...
2017-07-17 19:51:00	keveloper	Yes it is
2017-07-17 19:51:35	keveloper	secondly, the primary color overlaying the background image doesn't good as i'd hoped
2017-07-17 19:51:39	keveloper	A blue color does look nice htough
2017-07-17 19:52:06	merkazu	go for it
2017-07-17 19:55:16	keveloper	I took a screen shot
2017-07-17 19:55:20	keveloper	how would you like me to send it to you
2017-07-17 19:55:31	keveloper	Assuming you want something private e.g. no imgur
2017-07-17 19:55:39	merkazu	cl.ly?
2017-07-17 19:55:49	merkazu	same service gothalice uses
2017-07-17 19:56:43	keveloper	https://cl.ly/1t0E1J1k3F3A
2017-07-17 19:57:13	keveloper	image is just some random public domain image i found from searching "learning data" haha
2017-07-17 19:58:30	merkazu	hmm, orange and blue? interesting combo
2017-07-17 19:58:44	keveloper	They are opposites ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-07-17 19:58:47	merkazu	is there a teritary color you're going for?
2017-07-17 19:58:53	merkazu	ah
2017-07-17 19:59:09	keveloper	I don't have a teritary color
2017-07-17 19:59:35	keveloper	Following standard color pallette convetions I would have guess that your accent would be a shade of blue
2017-07-17 19:59:41	keveloper	guessed*
2017-07-17 19:59:45	keveloper	Did you have something else in mind?
2017-07-17 20:00:30	merkazu	hm, not really. other than Lugh's prominent colors, (red, orange, yellow)
2017-07-17 20:01:14	keveloper	Current pallet I'm working with: https://coolors.co/333333-fe9927-ffffff-18a3bf-333333
2017-07-17 20:01:19	keveloper	Ah okay
2017-07-17 20:01:30	keveloper	(This is the first I've heard of that)
2017-07-17 20:01:39	merkazu	oh is it? sorry
2017-07-17 20:01:45	merkazu	no, this looks good to me
2017-07-17 20:01:48	keveloper	Yeah previously I've only seen orange
2017-07-17 20:02:48	keveloper	First, do you like the direction of the header?
2017-07-17 20:02:52	keveloper	Otherwise let me know
2017-07-17 20:03:22	keveloper	One thing I don't love about it: It takes longer for the visiter to learn about Lugh, i.e. they have to scroll down to see what it's really about
2017-07-17 20:03:31	keveloper	Albeit the short blurb in the header is very useful
2017-07-17 20:03:32	merkazu	header or header+hero?
2017-07-17 20:03:38	keveloper	Yeah
2017-07-17 20:03:44	keveloper	I'm considering the header to be the hero and the nav
2017-07-17 20:03:59	merkazu	yeah, i'm in the same boat there
2017-07-17 20:04:10	merkazu	talentLMS was nice in their approach
2017-07-17 20:04:42	keveloper	They have the same amount of content visible upon load for the most part
2017-07-17 20:04:49	keveloper	Logo, nav, tagline, blurb
2017-07-17 20:04:55	keveloper	Scroll down for more content
2017-07-17 20:06:15	merkazu	https://cl.ly/351p1N2h0823
2017-07-17 20:06:52	merkazu	in this case, actual content starts roughly half way through the header rather than the header filling the entire space
2017-07-17 20:07:04	keveloper	Yeah besides that
2017-07-17 20:07:13	keveloper	Kind of like a "hey theres content down here!!"
2017-07-17 20:08:48	merkazu	since the audience i'm going after isn't exactly the sort to be swayed by pretty things, I'm inclined to have that header shrink
2017-07-17 20:09:09	merkazu	small-medium businesses, growing into their data, that sort of thing
2017-07-17 20:09:35	keveloper	If we apply the same strategy to my page: https://cl.ly/1i381t2d0J1R
2017-07-17 20:10:04	merkazu	yeah, that's better to me
2017-07-17 20:10:13	keveloper	No height set on content, 10em padding around the tagline area
2017-07-17 20:11:56	keveloper	Pushed changes
2017-07-17 20:12:05	keveloper	I'll keep you and the git repo updated frequently now
2017-07-17 20:13:32	keveloper	I'm headed out for now, I'll be working more on it tomorrow, fixing some responsive things and further improving the general flow so the visiter can more quickly assess the use
2017-07-17 20:13:43	merkazu	sounds good
2017-07-21 11:13:47	merkazu	how goes it?
2017-07-21 11:17:18	keveloper	It goes fine
2017-07-21 11:17:22	keveloper	Not a lot of changes in the last few days
2017-07-21 11:17:28	keveloper	Fixed some responsive design stuff
2017-07-21 11:17:38	keveloper	Had to run an install last night that went way long so I didn't get to do anything
2017-07-21 11:17:44	merkazu	fun
2017-07-21 11:17:51	keveloper	Let me see if the remote is up to date
2017-07-21 11:18:39	keveloper	Just pushed some changes
2017-07-21 11:18:59	keveloper	Should have a ton of time this weekend to work on it
2017-07-21 11:19:20	merkazu	awesome
2017-07-21 11:19:31	merkazu	i'm going to be working most of this weekend too
2017-07-21 11:19:39	keveloper	Sorry if you're getting worried about about delivery date
2017-07-21 11:20:07	merkazu	nah, i'm just trying to push this thing over into launch territory as soon as i'm able
2017-07-21 11:20:21	merkazu	especially now that i have a productive office to be in
2017-07-21 11:20:27	keveloper	Yeah for sure
2017-07-21 11:20:51	keveloper	I'm kind of nomadic at the moment half living at Emilys half living at my own apartment so productivity outside of work has plumeted
2017-07-21 11:20:56	keveloper	plumetted?...
2017-07-21 11:20:58	merkazu	oh?
2017-07-21 11:21:06	keveloper	plummeted that's it
2017-07-21 11:21:08	merkazu	something happen?
2017-07-21 11:21:30	keveloper	Me and Emily never lived together if that's what you mean haha
2017-07-21 11:21:48	merkazu	nah, i had figured it was something regarding the apartment
2017-07-21 11:22:14	keveloper	I just live far away from work now (dumb decision) so my time is kind of split between opposite sides of the city
2017-07-21 11:22:25	merkazu	oof
2017-07-21 11:22:29	keveloper	I don't even go to my apartment most days at this point
2017-07-24 14:31:14	merkazu	how was the weekend?
2017-07-26 14:31:10	keveloper	Hey idk how I missed that message my bad
2017-07-26 14:31:28	keveloper	I'm working tonight on it and I'll give you and update when I'm done
2017-07-26 14:31:40	merkazu	sounds good
2017-07-26 20:57:54	keveloper	Hey you there?
2017-07-26 20:58:04	merkazu	yep
2017-07-26 20:58:11	keveloper	I've pushed changes to the repo
2017-07-26 20:58:52	keveloper	I've added just a tiny amount of JS for the mobile nav to just to show the styling
2017-07-26 20:59:16	keveloper	What do you think of the current progress? Anything you'd like to add? Any notes?
2017-07-26 21:01:06	merkazu	is the menu navigation still not working or is that part of the bundle.js file?
2017-07-26 21:01:36	keveloper	Uhh.. I guess for you it wouldn't work unless you run npm start from root
2017-07-26 21:01:57	keveloper	If you don't want to do that I can strip out the bundling crap really quickly and just use the index.js file
2017-07-26 21:02:17	merkazu	yeah, i'm not going to be using NPM at all
2017-07-26 21:02:40	keveloper	lol that's fine, this isn't how I'd deliver or anything this is just the template I use for everything
2017-07-26 21:02:59	merkazu	i understand
2017-07-26 21:03:16	merkazu	just a bit hard to provide feedback when i can't see everything you do :)
2017-07-26 21:05:48	merkazu	i do like the small touches with the article sections in the middle of the page
2017-07-26 21:06:07	merkazu	and everything responds well
2017-07-26 21:06:45	keveloper	Are you just using file:///
2017-07-26 21:06:53	merkazu	header does overlap text in the areas between phone and tablet when you scroll down though. no sort of background/gradient on it
2017-07-26 21:06:57	keveloper	If you pull index.html is using index.js
2017-07-26 21:07:50	merkazu	no, dev.projectmerk.local, mamp instance, pointing to index.html
2017-07-26 21:07:58	merkazu	and at the bottom, it's calling for bundle.js
2017-07-26 21:08:09	merkazu	L148: <script src="bundle.js"></script>
2017-07-26 21:08:16	keveloper	-_- I have to leave right now to bring Emily her debit card
2017-07-26 21:08:24	merkazu	no worries
2017-07-26 21:08:26	keveloper	Soryr
2017-07-26 21:08:28	keveloper	.........
2017-07-26 21:08:41	merkazu	i'm still wrestling with pricing, lol
2017-07-26 21:09:11	merkazu	finding the right thing to focus on and help sell the whole thing
2017-07-26 21:51:53	keveloper	Alright I'm back you there?
2017-07-26 21:53:25	keveloper	But anyway earlier I meant as we were talking a committed and pushed changes to use index.js instead of the bundle
2017-07-26 21:57:24	keveloper	Also just pushed changes to the font
2017-07-26 21:58:55	keveloper	I realized I changed the font URL without changing the font family so it was using system default sans serif for a while :|  I was wondering why the font looked so bad
2017-07-26 22:05:07	keveloper	Also I darkened the shadow for the nav when scrolled. Should be more noticable now and will better separate it from header content
2017-07-26 22:29:16	keveloper	Also added icons to the seling point section
2017-07-26 23:06:36	keveloper	I'm liking these icons a lot, also I fixed some cross browser stuff
2017-07-27 12:15:17	keveloper	Hey I'll work some more tonight on the landing page, let me know your thoughts when you look at these changes
2017-07-27 22:23:47	merkazu	Evening keveloper
2017-07-27 22:24:36	merkazu	i'm looking here and I'm liking everything with one exception. If you're on mobile/tablet size and you've scrolled a ways down, opening the menu is essentially a scrolljack back to the top
2017-07-27 22:25:05	merkazu	opening/closing, rather
2017-07-28 08:57:46	keveloper	Yeah that's just href="#" putting you at the top
2017-07-28 08:57:53	keveloper	i can change it to a js void or something if you want
2017-07-28 08:59:29	merkazu	you have js on that don't you? just add e.preventDefault() on that particular click event
2017-07-28 09:00:11	keveloper	Oh yeah I forgot I had a listener there lol oops
2017-07-28 09:00:26	keveloper	It's early
2017-07-28 09:00:36	merkazu	totally understandable
2017-07-31 10:39:30	keveloper	Hey hows it goin
2017-07-31 10:50:09	merkazu	not too bad, yourself?
2017-07-31 10:50:15	keveloper	Pretty good
2017-07-31 10:50:48	keveloper	So I should get some more work done tonight, doing some cleanup of scss maybe some markup cleanup
2017-07-31 10:51:32	keveloper	Also tweaking some things just trying to make it look better
2017-07-31 10:51:43	keveloper	Are you liking the page right now? Any comments? Things you would like me to change?
2017-07-31 11:01:40	merkazu	just trying to get things set up here then i'll take a look
2017-07-31 11:01:50	keveloper	Cool
2017-07-31 11:02:14	keveloper	I'll work on it from 6:30-7:30 then at 9 and later most likely
2017-07-31 11:08:04	merkazu	looks good to me. The only things I'd suggest is maybe restricting the benefits section to three columns. after it splits out to four, i feel like the head part of those sections get a little funky as they become 50% of the width instead of ~25-33%. The other thing, it doesn't look like the e.prevent
2017-07-31 11:08:16	merkazu	e.preventDefault portion got added in
2017-07-31 11:09:14	keveloper	No I havent added that yet lol sorry
2017-07-31 11:09:22	keveloper	And okay I'll look into restricting that
2017-07-31 22:12:23	keveloper	Hey, fixed the menu scrolling thing and fixed the main article section max width so there will only ever be max 3 sections in a row
2017-07-31 22:17:50	keveloper	Also I changed the background pic to something a little more abstract (public domain), I'm assuming youl
2017-07-31 22:17:58	keveloper	Also I changed the background pic to something a little more abstract (public domain), I'm assuming you'll change this to something you find suiting??
2017-07-31 22:28:23	keveloper	Refactored scss
2017-07-31 22:29:08	keveloper	Do you want the font file to be served from your server or a cdn
2017-08-01 17:51:48	keveloper	I'll work more tonight so let me know about the above
2017-08-01 19:08:28	merkazu	awesome. Yeah, I'll change it to something a bit more fitting. let me handle the logistics of the font file. For now, assume serving from the server.
2017-08-01 19:09:03	keveloper	Okay cool
2017-08-01 19:09:26	keveloper	I'm looking into changing the hero to be an SVG with an animation; something more appealing than just an image
2017-08-01 19:09:35	keveloper	Pretty overplayed and boring honestly as far as landing pages go
2017-08-01 19:09:41	merkazu	aye
2017-08-01 19:09:42	keveloper	Not very eye catching or interesting
2017-08-01 19:14:30	merkazu	i don't know how you feel about flat-ish design but this was something I was thinking of replacing the hero with. https://il2.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/822997/thumb/1.jpg + a stack of books in the middle like a microprocessor https://boygeniusreport.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/microprocessor.jpg?quality=98&strip=all
2017-08-01 19:15:08	merkazu	probably be a fair bit of SVG work so don't feel pressured to do it
2017-08-01 19:16:41	merkazu	or this, this'd be way more thematically consistent and usable for logo purposes. http://images.cdn2.stockunlimited.net/preview1300/tree-design-on-circuit-board-background_1646948.jpg with the lines extending from the books at the root
2017-08-01 19:16:57	merkazu	(lugh in mythology had associations with yew trees)
2017-08-01 19:24:30	keveloper	oh that last one is cool
2017-08-01 19:24:54	keveloper	no i want to give you a great product and currently i would just says its "fine" haha
2017-08-01 19:25:27	keveloper	do you want to incorporate learning to it? aside from the circuit?
2017-08-01 19:25:52	merkazu	Matt and I, before he had to pass due to competition reasons, were talking about taking this kinda of approach for the logo, minus the whole circuitry theme
2017-08-01 19:26:27	merkazu	do you feel that the books at the base or the board being on the cover does not sufficiently represent the learning component?
2017-08-01 19:26:58	merkazu	my thought is more about emphasizing the data integration points of the products rather than the product itself
2017-08-01 19:29:05	keveloper	ah i didnt notice that note after the link
2017-08-02 00:20:42	keveloper	Hey, I pushed a POC svg animation for the header (not at all what the final product will be, but the direction I'm going, expect much better)
2017-08-02 00:21:47	keveloper	Also, I told you a month or two ago but I'll be out of town August 3rd to August 8th so I won't be working much during that time. I will most likely work at the airport and on the plane though. Also in there will be a 3 day hike where I wont be reachable via cell
2017-08-02 00:21:59	keveloper	I'll be on here until 12pm tomorrow
2017-08-02 00:22:00	keveloper	EST
2017-08-02 19:38:29	merkazu	i'm impressed by the direction

2017-08-09 15:39:46	keveloper	Good to hear, I'll be working tonight on it
2017-08-10 10:03:00	merkazu	how was the trip?
2017-08-10 10:03:10	keveloper	It was awesome, lots of hiking
2017-08-10 10:03:12	keveloper	Crazy mountains
2017-08-10 10:03:23	keveloper	I had to work an install last night I didn't get to work on the page :(
2017-08-10 10:03:33	merkazu	ah
2017-08-10 10:03:46	keveloper	Pics from trip: https://goo.gl/photos/thRoHU5c76ctRMVu9
2017-08-10 10:03:49	keveloper	It was amazing
2017-08-10 10:03:59	merkazu	https://cl.ly/2R3q2b0W0x28
2017-08-10 10:04:02	keveloper	But anyway I'm working on the page tonight, I have a cool idea
2017-08-10 10:04:11	merkazu	already got the assets
2017-08-10 10:04:29	keveloper	is that tree an svg
2017-08-10 10:04:47	merkazu	nah, i have PNG/AI
2017-08-10 10:04:59	keveloper	I can recreate it with paths and animate it
2017-08-10 10:05:47	merkazu	damn son, that's a gorgeous location
2017-08-10 10:05:48	keveloper	I have an idea where the roots are going to come down off of the header down to the selling points in the middle
2017-08-10 10:05:51	keveloper	which sounds weird but
2017-08-10 10:05:59	keveloper	I know right, it was crazy
2017-08-10 10:06:05	merkazu	sounds like an interesting idea actually
2017-08-10 10:06:31	merkazu	kinda like one of those events on scroll type sites?
2017-08-10 10:06:36	keveloper	Yeah
2017-08-10 10:06:54	keveloper	And would probably just be not there on mobile
2017-08-10 10:08:14	merkazu	need me to send you the PNG tonight?
2017-08-10 10:09:58	keveloper	Yeah please
2017-08-10 10:10:01	keveloper	When'd you get that made?
2017-08-10 10:10:10	merkazu	about two days ago
2017-08-10 10:10:19	merkazu	put in the request on sunday, give or take
2017-08-10 10:10:23	keveloper	Cool cool
2017-08-10 10:10:28	keveloper	Using some service?
2017-08-10 10:10:41	merkazu	fiverr since matt wasn't able to work on this one
2017-08-10 10:11:07	keveloper	Oh cool, never seen this
2017-08-10 10:11:26	merkazu	still working things out with Matt, first few bits of creative just didn't work for me
2017-08-10 10:13:17	merkazu	i was pretty surprised i was able to get a logo like that from the designer for $100 ._.
2017-08-10 10:13:47	keveloper	Yeah it looks good
2017-08-10 10:13:52	keveloper	is there a short form of it?
2017-08-10 10:13:59	merkazu	er?
2017-08-10 10:14:09	keveloper	Like for an icon
2017-08-10 10:14:24	merkazu	oh, that's what the AI file would be for
2017-08-10 10:14:33	keveloper	is "learning data made intelligent" the tagline
2017-08-10 10:14:38	keveloper	or is that subject to change
2017-08-10 10:14:51	merkazu	subject to change, i'm not 100% on it
2017-08-10 10:15:04	keveloper	Ah okay
2017-08-10 10:15:10	keveloper	I'll throw that onto the page for now tonight
2017-08-10 10:15:36	merkazu	aight, I'll probably consult Emily about the tagline tonight as she should be back too
2017-08-10 10:16:56	keveloper	Okay, she said she's been thinking of ideas in the back of her head the other day lol, so I'm sure she'll be down for it
2017-08-10 11:05:07	keveloper	Have you got anywork after the landing page stuff? Just curious
2017-08-10 18:55:50	merkazu	sent the logo your way
2017-08-10 18:58:01	keveloper	Cool
2017-08-13 20:01:28	keveloper	hey any chance I could get the book/tree part of the logo as an svg?
2017-08-13 20:01:39	keveloper	(I dont have illustrator)

2017-08-14 20:32:55	keveloper	Hey you there?
2017-08-14 20:33:53	merkazu	now i am
2017-08-14 20:34:03	merkazu	remarkable timing
2017-08-14 20:35:10	keveloper	Ha :P
2017-08-14 20:35:43	keveloper	I'm gonna send you a screennshot of the header right now
2017-08-14 20:35:50	keveloper	I changed it a bit to fit the logo
2017-08-14 20:36:12	keveloper	https://cl.ly/3T3g3t3r1l2c
2017-08-14 20:36:39	keveloper	Couple things: I'll change the LughLMS and tagline to actual text
2017-08-14 20:37:14	merkazu	i like it
2017-08-14 20:37:32	keveloper	If you could get the book/circuit part as an svg with paths that'd be awesome
2017-08-14 20:37:33	keveloper	might be hard though
2017-08-14 20:38:01	keveloper	I'm going to try an idea to fill the left and right space
2017-08-14 20:38:33	merkazu	did my email not work for you?
2017-08-14 20:38:58	keveloper	Oh I didn't see it :o
2017-08-14 20:38:59	merkazu	granted, i did send you an SVG like two or three minutes ago
2017-08-14 20:39:24	keveloper	:P
2017-08-14 20:39:27	keveloper	phones in my pocket lol
2017-08-14 20:39:29	keveloper	wasn't on gmail
2017-08-14 20:40:53	keveloper	Eh probably won't work :(
2017-08-14 20:40:55	keveloper	Let me try
2017-08-14 20:44:14	keveloper	Eh didn't work
2017-08-14 20:44:19	merkazu	:(
2017-08-14 20:46:05	keveloper	Has to be paths to work
2017-08-14 20:46:15	keveloper	I'll put that off, might not need it
2017-08-14 20:46:37	merkazu	okay, what was your thought on using that?
2017-08-14 20:46:58	keveloper	dash offset animation
2017-08-14 20:47:07	keveloper	To bring attention to that part of the logo
2017-08-14 20:51:34	merkazu	wonder if that one will work
2017-08-14 20:51:43	merkazu	used the EPS file, opened up in a trial copy of AI
2017-08-14 20:56:03	keveloper	Ayy that'll do
2017-08-14 21:41:06	keveloper	do you know the font used in the logo?
2017-08-14 21:41:09	keveloper	the LughLMS part?
2017-08-14 21:42:29	merkazu	that, i do not
2017-08-14 21:43:06	merkazu	honestly, i don't care a great deal about it, we can work around it with a different font if it works better for the overall site theme
2017-08-14 21:49:12	keveloper	https://cl.ly/27470L0W1x1W
2017-08-14 21:49:20	keveloper	Lol gif wasn't quite the framerate i was hoping for
2017-08-14 21:50:04	merkazu	nice
2017-08-14 21:51:20	keveloper	Pushed
2017-08-14 21:51:28	merkazu	sweet
2017-08-14 21:55:32	keveloper	Added text anti-aliasing for webkit
2017-08-14 21:58:18	keveloper	Ooh, I thinned the lines for the svg and it looks awesome
2017-08-14 21:58:33	merkazu	yeah?
2017-08-14 21:58:41	keveloper	Pushed
2017-08-14 22:03:29	keveloper	Hmm now to fill up the space on either side
2017-08-14 22:51:12	keveloper	Did some more things, most notably fixed an svg width problem at small screen size and fixed the responsiveness of the articles section
2017-08-14 22:51:25	keveloper	Do a pull when you can and let me know what you think
2017-08-14 22:51:49	keveloper	I need to find a way to use all the unused space in the header so that will be my next venture
2017-08-14 22:55:58	keveloper	Also changed the timing on the header animation

2017-08-15 21:02:28	merkazu	damn son
2017-08-15 21:02:42	merkazu	that SVG animation is on point
2017-08-15 21:03:22	keveloper	:)
2017-08-15 21:03:47	merkazu	i wonder if it might be better served on the book side to have the SVG animation start inside out rather than outside in
2017-08-15 21:04:13	merkazu	so it's projecting from the book instead of feeding into it
2017-08-15 21:04:18	keveloper	its a little limited without redefining the paths 
2017-08-15 21:04:26	merkazu	fair
2017-08-15 21:04:26	keveloper	i can see what i can do
2017-08-15 21:04:48	merkazu	the celtic knot outline effect is really good though
2017-08-15 21:04:57	keveloper	i had it reversed but it looked bizarre because the circles would fill out first
2017-08-15 21:05:05	merkazu	i played it like five times
2017-08-15 21:05:20	keveloper	lol yeah that looks awesome
2017-08-15 21:05:34	keveloper	i was staring at it for a bit
2017-08-17 00:42:05	--	irc: disconnected from server
2017-08-17 10:32:10	keveloper	lol this guy knows just enough to talk about webdev but not enough to form any sort of meaningful sentences about it lol
2017-08-17 10:32:28	merkazu	that... was my impression too
2017-08-17 10:33:16	keveloper	the thing about some mvc design where there's a "global state object" in the "js page" lol
2017-08-17 19:50:44	merkazu	do you have a rough idea of when we might be moving forward with the completion of the landing page?
2017-08-17 20:01:36	merkazu	don't worry about it too much, just give me an idea. I'm headed back for tonight
2017-08-18 00:03:23	keveloper	Sorry, should be within the next week

2017-08-19 19:38:04	merkazu	what's up?
2017-08-19 19:38:13	keveloper	Made some cool changes to the page
2017-08-19 19:38:19	keveloper	one of them I really like
2017-08-19 19:38:47	keveloper	just pushsed
2017-08-19 19:39:42	keveloper	I also was thinking about adding this type of animation: https://codepen.io/tommyldunn/pen/WEZNLq
2017-08-19 19:40:11	keveloper	Something like "LughLMS is ['accessible', 'secure', 'customizable', ...]" etc.
2017-08-19 19:40:36	keveloper	Right above the selling points section
2017-08-19 19:41:23	keveloper	Also I don't know if you've noticed but we'll need some new content to fill in the 'Start using some cool data about learning and junk' placeholdder lol
2017-08-19 19:42:07	merkazu	the knot getting filled in last is a nice touch
2017-08-19 19:42:11	keveloper	:)
2017-08-19 19:42:17	keveloper	Knew you liked the knot lol
2017-08-19 19:42:29	merkazu	how could i not :)
2017-08-19 19:42:32	keveloper	I need to tune the timing in the header a little more
2017-08-19 19:42:37	keveloper	you mean how could you KNOT?
2017-08-19 19:42:39	keveloper	:P
2017-08-19 19:42:46	merkazu	hehe
2017-08-19 19:43:00	keveloper	Anyway did you the scroll triggered highlight part
2017-08-19 19:43:13	merkazu	yeah, just came across that
2017-08-19 19:43:41	merkazu	where were you thinking for the auto-typing animation?
2017-08-19 19:44:00	keveloper	between "measurable impact on your business" and the selling points below it
2017-08-19 19:44:33	keveloper	Or it could be just after the selling points section to summarize it
2017-08-19 19:44:43	keveloper	I'd make it faster than the codepen I sent because that is slooooow
2017-08-19 19:45:10	merkazu	i like the overall concept, i'm not a fan of the execution there
2017-08-19 19:45:11	keveloper	One thing I need to change is time to settle on the header animation
2017-08-19 19:45:14	keveloper	Takes too long imo
2017-08-19 19:45:22	keveloper	The codepen?
2017-08-19 19:45:24	merkazu	aye
2017-08-19 19:45:35	merkazu	the entire block of text is moving all while doing this
2017-08-19 19:45:38	keveloper	Yeah I think it's way too slow
2017-08-19 19:45:39	keveloper	and YES
2017-08-19 19:45:46	keveloper	text-align:center; was a terrible idea
2017-08-19 19:45:54	keveloper	I would _not_ do that lol
2017-08-19 19:46:08	keveloper	I've seen way better implementations of this but I can't find them atm
2017-08-19 19:47:35	merkazu	i kinda wonder if you could make the section with the dynamic content be a screen, have a few of the blue/orange circuit lines feeding into it. it'll pulse inwards, clear the contents of the screen and type in the next element
2017-08-19 19:49:01	keveloper	Oooh
2017-08-19 19:49:04	keveloper	Okay I can see that
2017-08-19 19:49:33	keveloper	By dynamic content you mean the change phrase of the autotype part?
2017-08-19 19:49:55	merkazu	['accessible', 'secure', 'customizable', ...]
2017-08-19 19:50:05	keveloper	Yeah okay
2017-08-19 19:50:12	keveloper	I can see what I can do
2017-08-19 19:55:19	merkazu	it's looking pretty darn cool so far
2017-08-19 19:55:41	keveloper	Glad you like it :)
2017-08-19 19:56:20	keveloper	one thing I'm still trying to solve is the wasted header space when at 1080px wide an dup
2017-08-19 20:06:40	merkazu	oh, i wonder if you could just replace that bottom portion with the placeholder with your idea?
2017-08-19 20:07:04	merkazu	rather than needing another copy request for that section
2017-08-19 20:07:29	merkazu	LughLMS is ['accessible', 'secure', 'customizable', ...] [Learn More]
2017-08-19 21:58:26	keveloper	Good idea
2017-08-19 23:20:58	keveloper	You there?
2017-08-19 23:22:25	keveloper	heh, having accessible in this autotyper thing is ironic...
2017-08-19 23:22:58	keveloper	So I've pushed the autotype feature, I really like it
2017-08-19 23:23:13	keveloper	One thing: for now I have the text centered, so it moves when it's typing
2017-08-19 23:23:26	keveloper	I will fix that tomorrow
2017-08-19 23:23:57	keveloper	It will require a bit of clever positioning to make it centered on all view sizes but I don't have the brain power to do it right now :P
2017-08-19 23:24:09	keveloper	Let me know what you think. I think it turned out quite well.
2017-08-20 08:38:36	merkazu	the black background on the bottom section is so much more appealing to me
2017-08-20 08:39:09	merkazu	the autotyping gets rather weird though when it goes to smaller screens, it's causing the box to bounce quite a bit
2017-08-20 08:41:34	merkazu	https://cl.ly/3y3m2d373X29
2017-08-20 08:44:42	merkazu	maybe a media query to push the span onto its own line below, say 480px?
2017-08-20 09:33:14	keveloper	Yeah I noticed that
2017-08-20 09:33:20	keveloper	Yep that was my idea
2017-08-20 10:28:43	merkazu	oh, kevin, you like designing little ui elements like icons, don't you? or is that more of a matt thing?
2017-08-20 10:29:52	merkazu	there's a page that I'm planning on which is going to be largely repeated UI elements but with a different associated image for each
2017-08-20 10:31:38	merkazu	two, actually. an industries page and a solutions page. how LughLMS can be used in different types of industries (and related Anima Analytics products that can help out as well), and then the types of usage like onboarding, lifelong learning, role-based training
2017-08-20 10:32:09	keveloper	I do \o/
2017-08-20 10:43:49	keveloper	k autotype is fixed
2017-08-22 10:37:15	merkazu	how's emily doing?
2017-08-22 10:38:29	keveloper	She's good
2017-08-22 10:38:56	keveloper	If you're really asking why she hasn't emailed you yet she keeps saying "I need to email john back"
2017-08-22 10:38:57	merkazu	i'm going to see if i can follow up with her this evening and then possibly talk about the copy on other pages
2017-08-22 10:39:09	keveloper	I think she's still figuring out timeline and pricing
2017-08-22 10:39:27	merkazu	aha, okay
2017-08-22 10:40:00	keveloper	idk what her plan is i haven't really talked to her about it lol
2017-08-22 10:41:54	merkazu	I'm also hoping to have some basic UI components wireframed in the next few days to start building out the other pages
2017-08-22 10:42:23	keveloper	Ooh pick me pick me \o
2017-08-22 10:44:31	merkazu	hehe, yeah, you'll be on it
2017-08-22 10:45:24	keveloper	whats your current take on the landing page? anyhting you wanna improve?
2017-08-22 10:45:38	keveloper	(dont worry about cross browser stuff yet ill work on that before i deliver)
2017-08-22 10:45:51	merkazu	honestly, i think it's looking fantastic as is
2017-08-22 10:46:00	keveloper	great to hear
2017-08-22 10:46:42	keveloper	do you want me to make it 100% accessibile?
2017-08-22 10:46:48	keveloper	accessible* lol
2017-08-22 10:47:07	keveloper	Only tricky part is the autotype thing
2017-08-22 10:47:09	merkazu	I'll be altering the footer a bit, just different/new columns of links, up to five columns but I should be able to use what you have
2017-08-22 10:47:33	keveloper	I can double check to make sure adding more columns works fine
2017-08-22 10:47:41	merkazu	as for the accessibility, if it's going to extend the timeline significantly, I won't worry too much about it
2017-08-22 10:47:52	keveloper	atm I don't remember how it's structure because I haven't really looked at it since I wrote 9 months ago or whatever
2017-08-22 10:48:25	keveloper	It wouldn't extend timeline as I plan to finish this week no matter what but I'm pretty sure I'm close to 50 hours now
2017-08-22 10:48:50	merkazu	allright
2017-08-22 10:49:05	keveloper	I haven't been tracking my time or anything though so I'm not going to ask for anymore than $1750 though :P
2017-08-22 10:49:06	merkazu	then next week shall be fun UI components!
2017-08-22 10:49:30	keveloper	FYI I'll be out of town Friday-Monday night
2017-08-22 10:49:43	keveloper	I'll hop on irc once a day or so though to see if you said anything
2017-08-22 10:49:48	merkazu	pricing model's pretty settled at this point, other pages i've got a good concept of what they should look like
2017-08-22 10:49:57	keveloper	If there's anything time sensitive (I doubt there will be?) you can email me
2017-08-22 10:50:06	merkazu	don't worry, if you're out of town, i'll just email instead if it's important
2017-08-22 10:50:13	keveloper	Sounds good
2017-08-22 10:50:29	keveloper	Again sorry on the delay, I know end of July was the original idea
2017-08-22 10:50:48	merkazu	that's allright, i take the uhh, kojima approach to development
2017-08-22 10:51:10	merkazu	better to deliver a great game late than to deliver a bad game on time or a fantastic game never
2017-08-22 10:51:35	merkazu	and well, this is already well in fantastic territory :)
2017-08-22 10:51:42	keveloper	:)
2017-08-22 10:51:53	merkazu	logo and animation is gold, jerry, gold
2017-08-22 10:52:00	keveloper	Glad you like it :D
2017-08-22 10:52:21	keveloper	There's a few things I wanna improve but besides that it's pretty much done
2017-08-22 10:52:27	merkazu	oh?
2017-08-22 10:52:28	keveloper	responsiveness is looking good
2017-08-22 10:52:34	keveloper	small things like use of space
2017-08-22 10:52:39	merkazu	aha
2017-08-22 10:52:55	keveloper	I haven't looked at every common device size yet as far as mobile testing goes but
2017-08-22 10:53:13	keveloper	I think the text is a little close to the edge of the screen on smaller screens
2017-08-22 10:53:23	keveloper	Just little things like that I want to look better
2017-08-22 10:53:50	keveloper	Are you happy with the mobile nav menu?
2017-08-22 10:54:02	merkazu	yeah, it's good
2017-08-22 10:54:15	keveloper	Should I worry about browser prefixes?
2017-08-22 10:54:15	merkazu	say, you have a portfolio site?
2017-08-22 10:54:33	keveloper	Yeah I do, terribly optimized I really need to fix it but https://kevinholland.me
2017-08-22 10:54:39	merkazu	that'll be a data question. for now, i'm not worried about it
2017-08-22 10:55:43	keveloper	Also my backend for the contact form doesn't support SSL it's all a mess :'( lol
2017-08-22 10:56:28	merkazu	let's make sure there's a backlink to your portfolio somewhere on the site if you're okay with it, just pick a place that's reasonable and stick it in there
2017-08-22 10:56:54	keveloper	I'm okay with that
2017-08-22 10:57:00	keveloper	:D
2017-08-22 10:57:13	keveloper	I just need to fix it up before yours goes live :P
2017-08-22 10:58:00	merkazu	i'm thinking that i'll have everything sorted by november
2017-08-22 10:58:18	keveloper	Okay cool, I can have it fixed by then
2017-08-22 10:58:23	keveloper	Thanks for that btw
2017-08-22 11:03:37	merkazu	sure thing, we all could use more business
2017-08-23 19:10:53	keveloper	you have a favicon yet?
2017-08-23 19:11:08	merkazu	mmm, i do not
2017-08-23 19:11:20	keveloper	welp I'm sure you know how to do that :P
2017-08-23 19:11:40	merkazu	mmhm, i'll figure out something nice
2017-08-23 19:11:43	keveloper	You want me to do screenreader testing?
2017-08-23 19:11:59	merkazu	sure
2017-08-23 19:12:01	keveloper	cool
2017-08-23 19:12:12	keveloper	All I have is voiceover (macOS default) just fyi
2017-08-23 19:12:21	merkazu	fine with me
2017-08-23 19:35:06	keveloper	god i hate safari -_-
2017-08-23 19:35:24	merkazu	oh no, what did it do?
2017-08-23 19:35:32	keveloper	everything lol
2017-08-23 19:35:45	keveloper	but in this case deals with tabindex differently then every other browser
2017-08-23 19:35:58	merkazu	gross :(
2017-08-23 19:36:12	keveloper	you'd imagine anchor tags are automatically part of tabindex but nooo
2017-08-23 19:37:05	keveloper	wow i do not understand what safari is doing right now -_-
2017-08-23 19:37:23	keveloper	(we always have tab issue in safari on my team at oclc also)
2017-08-23 19:37:37	keveloper	oh right I think it's a preference
2017-08-23 19:37:51	keveloper	yep it is
2017-08-23 19:37:57	keveloper	this is why i hate safari lol
2017-08-23 19:38:22	keveloper	ahhhh there we go
2017-08-23 19:42:14	keveloper	andd on to mobile
2017-08-23 19:48:52	keveloper	Mobile looks good
2017-08-23 19:50:27	keveloper	I'm off for now (will be on tonight). Todo: Scroll trigger the autotype; more mobile testing; chrome audit;
2017-08-23 19:51:43	merkazu	sounds good. My goal for tonight, besides winning the lottery (700M) is to get the pricing page wireframed out and start building a spec doc for you on the UI
2017-08-23 20:43:11	keveloper	Did you play powerball
2017-08-23 20:43:15	keveloper	I shouldve gotten a ticket lol

2017-08-23 20:43:29	merkazu	office pool + 10 tickets
2017-08-23 20:43:30	keveloper	How much was the ticket
2017-08-23 20:43:42	merkazu	2 bucks apiece, so $22 total
2017-08-23 20:43:56	keveloper	Nice
2017-08-23 20:44:05	keveloper	Whens the drawing

2017-08-23 20:45:19	merkazu	there's a block period coming up pretty soon, all tickets sales stops
2017-08-23 21:09:54	keveloper	do you know when that is
2017-08-23 21:10:14	merkazu	i think it's the last hour leading up to the drawing
2017-08-23 21:10:26	merkazu	so in ~50 minutes
2017-08-23 21:11:18	keveloper	ah ok

2017-08-23 21:12:47	merkazu	$2 each
2017-08-23 21:12:50	keveloper	cool
2017-08-23 21:13:03	keveloper	how do you pick numbers i've never played the lottery
2017-08-23 21:13:09	merkazu	power play for another buck on top of that to multiply non-jackpot earnings
2017-08-23 21:13:32	keveloper	ah okay
2017-08-23 21:13:38	merkazu	i just go up to the counter and "ayo gurl, gimme ten tickets, let the machine pick"
2017-08-23 21:14:01	keveloper	is the "ayo gurl" part important
2017-08-23 21:14:05	keveloper	:P
2017-08-23 21:14:10	keveloper	okay imma go buy brb
2017-08-23 21:14:11	merkazu	v v v important
2017-08-23 21:22:32	merkazu	finished work for tonight, headed home
2017-08-23 21:29:17	keveloper	aight got my ticket lol
2017-08-23 22:01:28	keveloper	I can only get a 97/100 on the accessibility front with your choice of secondary colors. Contrast on the white background isn't high enough
2017-08-23 22:01:32	keveloper	Personally I think it's fin ethough
2017-08-23 22:01:53	keveloper	Note: I don't htink you should change your brand colors
2017-08-23 22:02:13	keveloper	If somebody can't read this they should be using a screen reader :P
2017-08-23 22:02:25	keveloper	I've done a good amount of screenreader testing and it looks goood
2017-08-23 22:02:46	keveloper	Only accessibility issue from aXe are contrast because of secondary brand color on white background so we're good on that front
2017-08-23 22:03:48	keveloper	On performance front currently the view rendering pause on the style sheet is 600ms, could be minified and optimized but that's outside the scope of this work
2017-08-23 22:04:30	keveloper	Also I increased the font-weight in the footer to make up for the contrast issue and it is much more readable now
2017-08-23 22:07:37	keveloper	Pushed changes for the night. Tomorrow I'll work on more mobile testing and clean everything up and it should be ready to go :D
2017-08-23 22:07:45	keveloper	(Oh yeah and scroll triggering autotype)
2017-08-24 20:34:33	keveloper	Mobile testing looks good :D
2017-08-24 20:34:41	keveloper	Scroll trigger for the autotype is good
2017-08-24 20:35:10	keveloper	i'll be doing some cleanup in a bit but we're looking done
2017-08-24 20:36:18	merkazu	awesome, i'm looking forward to it
2017-08-24 20:47:28	merkazu	also, i just went through some scheduling and it looks like I'll probably have to plan on the first of the year for the launch
2017-08-24 20:47:44	merkazu	MVP's going to take a bit
2017-08-24 21:28:10	keveloper	Cool, my availability will be way higher in the coming months :)
2017-08-24 21:28:16	keveloper	Last trip of the year this weekened :D
2017-08-24 21:28:19	keveloper	so ready to be done traveling
2017-08-24 21:28:35	merkazu	well, now that's a phrase i didn't think i'd see
2017-08-24 21:33:14	keveloper	Final commit pushed :D
2017-08-24 21:33:23	keveloper	If you find anything you would like changed let me know
2017-08-24 21:33:45	keveloper	I'm off for the night and then flying out tomorrow at 6:30AM so I will be reachable via email over the weekend
2017-08-24 21:34:02	merkazu	sounds good
2017-08-24 21:34:03	keveloper	Any updates I need to make if there is anything I will be available to complete next Tuesday
2017-08-24 21:34:09	keveloper	I'll send the quote next Tuesday
2017-08-24 21:34:15	keveloper	Err not quote...
2017-08-24 21:34:16	keveloper	Invoice
2017-08-24 21:34:25	merkazu	aye :)
2017-08-24 21:34:36	merkazu	and you definitely want a check this time?
2017-08-24 21:34:39	keveloper	Ight, talk to you later
2017-08-24 21:34:41	keveloper	Yes check this time :)
2017-08-24 21:34:45	merkazu	hehe
2017-08-24 21:34:47	keveloper	:P
2017-08-24 21:34:48	merkazu	enjoy your trip
2017-08-24 21:34:51	keveloper	thanks!
2017-08-24 21:34:54	keveloper	night
2017-08-29 16:56:10	keveloper	hey
2017-08-29 16:56:15	keveloper	did you review the final draft
2017-08-29 16:56:20	keveloper	one thing: i forgot to link my portfolio
2017-08-29 16:57:09	keveloper	i was thinking about playing with new fonts because I kind of rush delivered it last thursday
2017-08-29 16:57:38	keveloper	I think I can make it look a little better with the right font choices, I might do this tonight to see if I can get what I'm going for
2017-08-29 16:57:51	merkazu	yeah, everything's great. I just needed to tweak things a bit so I could import the header across all pages as your header was rather coupled with the tagline container
2017-08-29 16:57:52	keveloper	As far as the pricing page, that looks good
2017-08-29 16:57:54	keveloper	Pretty standard
2017-08-29 16:58:14	keveloper	Oh my bad
2017-08-29 16:58:20	merkazu	if you want to adjust the fonts, go ahead
2017-08-29 16:58:25	keveloper	Is it still responsive
2017-08-29 16:58:31	merkazu	you know it
2017-08-29 16:58:59	keveloper	Cool
2017-08-29 16:59:06	merkazu	the only thing i did was add a default background of roughly that shade on it and then a min-height of 56px to properly bump down body content
2017-08-29 17:00:00	keveloper	Ah okay
2017-08-29 17:29:36	keveloper	Did you per chance change that stuff in the repo?
2017-08-29 17:29:46	keveloper	I can give you push permission (which you might already have)
2017-08-29 17:30:10	merkazu	nah, just changed the markup directly as i copied it over
2017-08-29 17:30:20	merkazu	didn't want to interfere
2017-08-29 17:30:30	keveloper	ah okay
2017-08-30 20:16:48	keveloper	Well I tried out a bunch of new fonts and my favorite was still the original one I picked
2017-08-30 20:57:39	keveloper	Pushed some changed for mobile bar color
2017-08-30 20:57:42	keveloper	It was way to orange
2017-08-30 20:57:43	keveloper	too*
2017-08-30 20:57:58	keveloper	Besides that no changes made
2017-08-30 23:25:26	keveloper	Invoice sent
2017-08-31 14:23:53	merkazu	cool
2017-08-31 14:24:08	merkazu	finally made it back to the office for the first time this week
2017-08-31 14:24:14	merkazu	bills to pay yo
2017-08-31 14:30:20	keveloper	;)
2017-08-31 14:30:54	keveloper	I tried a new header format last night for fun and almost got something cool but I couldn't get it work with the primary/secondary colors of the logo
2017-08-31 14:31:21	keveloper	lmk if you'd like to see it and I can whip it up tonight and send you a screencap to see if you are interested
2017-08-31 14:31:37	merkazu	sure thing
2017-08-31 14:31:37	keveloper	unless you are 100% happy with the current landing page
2017-08-31 14:31:46	keveloper	I'm just not in love with the header for some reason
2017-08-31 14:31:48	keveloper	what are your thoughts?
2017-08-31 14:31:50	merkazu	always fun to see what people try
2017-08-31 14:31:59	keveloper	I'll try it out
2017-08-31 14:32:11	keveloper	I think I was going somewhere but I didn't have enough time to make it work last night
2017-08-31 14:33:38	merkazu	i like the touch of the mobile menu icon matching the color scheme
2017-08-31 14:33:45	keveloper	At this point I think I'm quite over the estimated 50 hours but I do really wanna try this out, could we work something out if you like it enough?
2017-08-31 14:33:59	keveloper	Ah yeah I learned about that during this
2017-08-31 14:33:59	merkazu	sure
2017-08-31 14:34:16	keveloper	Just searched "best practice for meta tags" and found a list of every possible meta tag lol
2017-08-31 14:34:40	keveloper	It started out as the primary color and it was blinding orange lol, so I switched it to grya
2017-09-01 11:44:37	keveloper	https://cl.ly/2u3v2i0b1l2y
2017-09-01 11:44:41	keveloper	Let me know if you like it
2017-09-01 11:45:50	merkazu	hmm
2017-09-01 11:46:13	merkazu	i kinda liked the full size black screen with the logo originally
2017-09-01 11:46:28	keveloper	Okay that's fine, just throwing the idea out there
2017-09-05 09:29:30	keveloper	Hey was just wondering if you've mailed the check yet? Just wondering when i can expect it
2017-09-05 09:29:46	merkazu	ah, i did notify matt, forgot to notify you
2017-09-05 09:30:05	merkazu	had mailed it a few days ago
2017-09-05 09:30:17	merkazu	you'll probably get it in the next two due to labor day
2017-09-05 09:33:12	keveloper	Cool
2017-09-05 09:33:20	keveloper	Did matt end up doing something for you?
2017-09-05 09:33:37	merkazu	yeah, he made a logo for Anima Analytics
2017-09-05 09:33:56	merkazu	not too bad looking, not in the same vein as lughLMS's though
2017-09-05 09:34:20	keveloper	Oh yeah you told me that
2017-09-05 14:59:19	keveloper	I'll get back to you on the pricing page tonight
2017-09-05 14:59:53	keveloper	or just right now I guess
2017-09-05 15:00:15	keveloper	Is the expanded one being hovered, selected, or is it just featured or something
2017-09-05 15:05:05	merkazu	just sized proportionally larger to encourage people to pick the more expensive option
2017-09-05 15:05:23	keveloper	Ah okay that's what I thought lol
2017-09-05 15:06:17	keveloper	I have ideas for this :)
2017-09-05 15:06:43	keveloper	Is this nav the same as the landing?
2017-09-05 15:06:48	merkazu	aye
2017-09-05 15:06:52	keveloper	I'm assuming this will be a page linked to from the landing page
2017-09-05 15:06:52	merkazu	and footer the same
2017-09-05 15:06:55	keveloper	Okay cool
2017-09-05 15:06:58	merkazu	that's correct
2017-09-05 15:09:48	keveloper	What do you want me to give you for this page?
2017-09-05 15:14:16	merkazu	what I'd like to get is the markup to build a card layout like the one you saw in the example, three rows in each column is fine. I'm not sure if i want to have the add ons or not below the page, similar to how Clever-cloud has their addons, what do you think?
2017-09-06 08:54:59	keveloper	That's pretty cool how clever cloud does it
2017-09-06 08:56:26	merkazu	their responsiveness is a bit broken though
2017-09-06 08:56:45	merkazu	data showing up at the end of the original row rather than below the addon itself
2017-09-06 08:59:10	keveloper	Wow it's very broken for me
2017-09-06 08:59:46	keveloper	http://imgur.com/a/OFDE0
2017-09-06 08:59:51	keveloper	horizontally scrollable too lol
2017-09-06 09:00:08	merkazu	yeah, their responsive design isn't great
2017-09-06 09:00:20	merkazu	but the overall concept seems solid to me
2017-09-06 09:00:34	keveloper	Yeah it's cool
2017-09-06 09:10:07	merkazu	made some good headway into the MVP over the weekend, got the database stuff taken care of so I should be able to start hooking things up and applying it to the endpoints in the application
2017-09-06 09:10:51	keveloper	awesome
2017-09-06 09:11:35	merkazu	might see about doing an early deploy this month with a "request beta access" link to gauge interest, start getting a mailing list together and all
2017-09-06 09:12:32	merkazu	there's this highly suspect meeting coming up next week at work. ambiguously labelled as "Department Meeting", got a feeling that it might be about announcing a round of layoffs given how slow we've been lately
2017-09-06 09:13:09	keveloper	:|
2017-09-06 09:14:05	merkazu	aye, more push for me to get off of that ship before it snaps in half
2017-09-07 13:32:17	merkazu	i'm actually really tempted to say, "hey, you should totally hire keveloper to do this site for you" but it sounds like it's more of a personal project
2017-09-07 13:32:30	keveloper	lol
2017-09-07 13:32:36	keveloper	He's always like "how does this look"
2017-09-07 13:32:40	keveloper	and im like "bad" lol
2017-09-07 13:32:49	merkazu	and i'm silent on the matter
2017-09-07 13:32:52	keveloper	i never know what he is actually talking about because everything seems like he just started working on it lol
2017-09-07 13:33:26	merkazu	because being deaf does not lend well to sublety, at all. we're known for being quite blunt
2017-09-07 13:33:32	merkazu	yeah, it does
2017-09-07 13:33:45	keveloper	I've never thought about that
2017-09-07 13:33:56	keveloper	But yeah I try very hard to polite to him :)
2017-09-07 13:34:08	keveloper	"looks nice to me"
2017-09-07 17:45:17	merkazu	called it
2017-09-07 17:45:22	merkazu	more layoffs
2017-09-07 17:45:29	 *	merkazu shrugs
2017-09-07 18:08:49	merkazu	also, looks like Matt got his check, did you get yours?
2017-09-08 08:54:50	keveloper	yep :D
2017-09-08 08:55:03	keveloper	i keep forgetting to cash it
2017-09-08 08:56:12	merkazu	the fun part comes april next year :)
2017-09-08 08:56:27	merkazu	since i paid you over $400, i need to issue forms for your taxes
2017-09-08 08:56:40	keveloper	nooooo
2017-09-08 08:56:55	merkazu	only two things are certain in life, death and taxes
2017-09-08 08:56:55	keveloper	also the limit is $500 right
2017-09-08 08:57:10	merkazu	threshold is $400
2017-09-08 08:57:12	keveloper	I don't wanna file it :'O lol
2017-09-08 08:57:22	merkazu	oh, you mean the filing limits?
2017-09-08 08:57:26	keveloper	yeah
2017-09-08 08:57:40	keveloper	it's $500 I think... i dont remember
2017-09-08 08:57:49	keveloper	I know that I will have to file my freelancing income this year tho
2017-09-08 08:58:19	merkazu	regular is 10,350 per 2016 filing requirements
2017-09-08 08:58:59	keveloper	I thought that's for regular in come
2017-09-08 08:59:10	keveloper	like if you make less than 10k in a year then you dont file at all
2017-09-08 08:59:21	merkazu	yeah, that's what i'm referring to
2017-09-08 08:59:40	merkazu	if this is right, it looks like the limit is $600
2017-09-08 08:59:50	keveloper	boo
2017-09-08 08:59:52	merkazu	veeeeery bottom: https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/am-i-required-to-file-a-form-1099-or-other-information-return
2017-09-08 09:00:39	keveloper	boo taxe
2017-09-08 09:00:54	merkazu	at least i'll be able to use one of my three years for tax purposes this year. highly doubt i'm netting zero this year with LughLMS
2017-09-08 09:01:56	merkazu	oh, other way around, one of my two net negative years
2017-09-08 09:02:50	merkazu	it'll be a wonderful day when I can just get an accountant to take care of all this for me
2017-09-08 09:07:05	merkazu	oi, there's one thing i forgot
2017-09-08 09:07:16	merkazu	y'all got any more of those travel photos?
2017-09-08 09:07:19	merkazu	:)
2017-09-08 09:08:49	merkazu	P.S. don't forget about the power of deductions for your freelancing income. Have a space dedicated to your freelance work? deduct the proportion of the rent for it. have a machine exclusively for your freelance portion, you get depreciation to deduct and so on
2017-09-08 09:09:44	keveloper	https://photos.app.goo.gl/JQAlNK1A9SIUDkSc2
2017-09-08 09:09:58	keveloper	That's all you haven't seen
2017-09-08 09:10:03	keveloper	You saw montana right
2017-09-08 09:10:11	keveloper	/glacier

2017-09-08 09:14:16	merkazu	plane? drone? a very tall rocky outcropping?
2017-09-08 09:14:48	keveloper	i jumped
2017-09-08 09:14:54	merkazu	F
2017-09-08 09:14:54	keveloper	no jk there's a bridge
2017-09-08 09:15:08	keveloper	you can see it in one of the pics
2017-09-08 09:15:53	keveloper	me and my brother rented a brand new 2018 volvo s90 t6 inscription fully loaded and drove around the desert it was amazing
2017-09-08 09:15:53	keveloper	lol
2017-09-08 09:16:08	merkazu	nice
2017-09-08 09:16:14	keveloper	i didnt get to take pics of car because my phone died :(
2017-09-08 09:16:20	keveloper	but it was _nice_
2017-09-08 09:16:27	keveloper	and had self-driving on the freeway
2017-09-08 09:16:28	merkazu	carry a power bank next time!
2017-09-08 09:16:29	keveloper	\o/\o/
2017-09-08 09:16:35	merkazu	oh cool
2017-09-08 09:16:37	keveloper	yeahhh i forgot it in ohio
2017-09-08 09:16:47	keveloper	and my phone battery is gettting exponentially worse
2017-09-08 09:16:48	merkazu	you take a nap and it drove itself?
2017-09-08 09:16:54	keveloper	nooo way
2017-09-08 09:16:58	merkazu	lol
2017-09-08 09:16:58	keveloper	it's not _that_ good
2017-09-08 09:17:18	keveloper	also las vegas freeway lines are actually terrible
2017-09-08 09:17:28	keveloper	you can hardly see them anymore you can just see the cat eyes
2017-09-08 09:17:34	merkazu	yeah, i've been there
2017-09-08 09:17:36	keveloper	so the car couldnt find the lines a lot
2017-09-08 09:19:52	keveloper	so do you want a quote for the pricing thing
2017-09-08 09:20:21	merkazu	do you feel like you have enough information to make a quote?
2017-09-08 09:20:39	keveloper	Do you want me to throw it on a page or give you just the element
2017-09-08 09:20:51	merkazu	just the element is fine
2017-09-08 09:20:52	keveloper	I might throw it on a page anyway to make sure it looks good with the header/footer
2017-09-08 09:21:03	keveloper	I can deliver just the element
2017-09-08 09:21:30	keveloper	"the element" meaning the 4 pricing elements or the whole pricing section
2017-09-08 09:21:46	merkazu	markup + css + sass files required for it. don't think any javascript is necessary unless you feel like the add on section should be a part of that page
2017-09-08 09:21:59	merkazu	the element being the pricing section, yes
2017-09-08 09:22:05	keveloper	Okay cool
2017-09-08 09:22:13	keveloper	No i don't think javascript is necessary
2017-09-08 09:22:26	keveloper	do you have the plan names
2017-09-08 09:22:29	merkazu	i'm open to design considerations
2017-09-08 09:22:53	keveloper	okay cool
2017-09-08 09:23:06	merkazu	emily and i are in talks about it. but for now, we can go with plan 1, plan 2, plan 3 and plan 4
2017-09-08 09:23:19	keveloper	okay
2017-09-08 09:23:28	keveloper	i was gonna see if I could think of some cool icons for them but oh well
2017-09-08 09:23:49	keveloper	She's given me some of her tagline ideas they are sounding good :D
2017-09-08 09:24:01	keveloper	I'll let you be in suspense until she gives you them tho :P
2017-09-08 09:24:28	merkazu	my initial suggestion was something along the lines of brochure, pamphlet, novel and epic. if i recall
2017-09-08 09:24:32	merkazu	very book themed
2017-09-08 09:24:44	keveloper	no textbook in there :P
2017-09-08 09:25:10	merkazu	oh, right, textbook was the third option between novel, pamphlet replaces brochure
2017-09-08 09:25:28	merkazu	so pamphlet, novel, textbook and epic
2017-09-08 09:25:35	keveloper	I feel like pamphlets are too small
2017-09-08 09:25:38	keveloper	And the word is weird
2017-09-08 09:25:44	merkazu	tell me about it
2017-09-08 09:25:53	merkazu	i keep wanting to spell it as phamplet
2017-09-08 09:26:01	keveloper	famplit

2017-09-11 21:16:58	merkazu	what's up?
2017-09-11 21:17:41	keveloper	Was throwing some of Emily's ideas on the page locally and thought the font-size and margin should change on the tagline on the landing page
2017-09-11 21:17:53	merkazu	okay
2017-09-11 21:18:38	keveloper	body > header section.tagline-container p.subheader { font-size: 1.5em; ... }
2017-09-11 21:18:57	keveloper	body > header section.tagline-container p.subheader { ... margin-bottom: .3em; ... }
2017-09-11 21:18:59	keveloper	if you want em
2017-09-11 21:19:24	keveloper	Oops copied the wrong selector for the second one :P
2017-09-11 21:19:46	keveloper	body > header section.tagline-container p.company-header { ... margin-bottom: .3em; ... }
2017-09-11 21:20:54	merkazu	got them, thanks
2017-09-11 21:40:18	keveloper	I also made the tagline white and I think it looks way better
2017-09-11 21:40:28	merkazu	yeah?
2017-09-11 21:50:22	keveloper	I still want to play with this header agh :|
2017-09-11 21:50:31	keveloper	I just feel like it's not using the space very well
2017-09-11 21:52:15	merkazu	if that's how you feel about it then let's work that into the quote for the pricing page parts
2017-09-11 21:52:55	keveloper	I'm not sure what the solution is yet but I think there is a better design for it
2017-09-11 21:53:02	merkazu	i'm just going to need to lift off the throttle a bit over the next month or two so i can keep paying the bills, tis all
2017-09-11 21:53:28	keveloper	No payment necessary for this :)
2017-09-11 21:54:01	keveloper	I gave you a product I think could be better, so I'll make it better :P
2017-09-11 22:01:06	merkazu	well damn

2017-09-11 22:10:33	merkazu	also pretty funny that she mentioned the difficulty of finding taglines on any of the other competitors
2017-09-11 22:11:08	merkazu	i'm not terribly surprised with the lack of care in that industry, actually
2017-09-11 22:11:47	keveloper	yeah the other taglines are pretty bad
2017-09-11 22:11:59	merkazu	which ones did you see?
2017-09-11 22:12:15	keveloper	I don't know which they were she had a big list of about 15 though

2017-09-13 19:02:19	keveloper	You really need a smaller icon that will work in small spaces

2017-09-13 19:59:15	merkazu	current direction for the header?
2017-09-13 20:34:07	keveloper	Use space more effeciently, highlight the tagline
2017-09-13 20:34:21	keveloper	no need for the company name to be so big, it's obvious what site your on
2017-09-13 20:34:40	merkazu	SVG animation?
2017-09-13 20:34:47	keveloper	Still there don't you fret
2017-09-13 20:34:49	keveloper	:P
2017-09-13 20:34:51	merkazu	hehe
2017-09-13 20:35:03	merkazu	behavior on tablet/mobile?
2017-09-13 20:35:58	merkazu	probably the same, or close to previous version, i assume?
2017-09-13 20:36:21	keveloper	Yes pretty much the same
2017-09-13 20:36:41	keveloper	I like the white header wayyy better honestly
2017-09-13 20:36:41	merkazu	seems good to me, the only thing i'm thinking might be better on what you showed me is Data breaking down with Driven Learning
2017-09-13 20:36:45	keveloper	I think it looks way more professional
2017-09-13 20:36:51	merkazu	white header?
2017-09-13 20:36:51	keveloper	I'm playing with breaking up the page in other ways
2017-09-13 20:36:53	keveloper	https://cl.ly/0X3A0I3x2t41
2017-09-13 20:37:10	merkazu	aha
2017-09-13 20:37:13	keveloper	Something in that direction
2017-09-13 20:37:27	keveloper	What do you think?
2017-09-13 20:37:59	merkazu	besides the CTA being offset a bit, seems good
2017-09-13 20:40:05	keveloper	Yeah I'm gonna fix that
2017-09-13 20:42:11	keveloper	https://cl.ly/0j3i2g2V3n12
2017-09-13 20:42:34	keveloper	Honestly I think it looks _way_ more modern and professional
2017-09-13 20:43:23	merkazu	yeah, i'm liking where this is going
2017-09-13 20:44:28	keveloper	me too :)
2017-09-13 20:46:44	keveloper	I'll continue working on this, getting off for the night, see ya!
2017-09-13 20:46:50	merkazu	good night
2017-09-14 01:10:02	keveloper	Currently what I'm playing with: https://cl.ly/062B0e0Q0p2f
2017-09-14 01:10:51	keveloper	Trying to make the background more interesting using svg, attempting to follow a material design look
2017-09-14 18:25:38	keveloper	lmk if you want me to push the current progress up to a branch for you
2017-09-14 18:59:41	merkazu	that's okay, we can do that when you're happy with it
2017-09-14 23:26:49	keveloper	What do you think so far?
2017-09-16 10:53:22	merkazu	hm? did you add something?
2017-09-17 18:20:56	keveloper	Hey new design is here: https://github.com/kholland950/projmerk/tree/newdesign2
2017-09-18 16:08:05	keveloper	Hey lemme know when you've had a chance to look at it :D
2017-09-18 16:08:14	merkazu	hm?
2017-09-18 16:08:27	keveloper	Also, if you want, I can throw up the landing page on my vps on a password protected server so you don't have to pull changed and compile scss blah blah blah
2017-09-18 16:08:31	merkazu	okay, i'll stop by the office today briefly
2017-09-18 16:08:56	merkazu	i'm headed that way through town anyway, picking up a gift card for my dad
2017-09-18 16:09:02	merkazu	his birthday today
2017-09-18 16:09:07	keveloper	do you want me to host it? I can just make the password "merkazu" or something
2017-09-18 16:09:24	merkazu	nah, that's cool
2017-09-18 16:09:28	keveloper	Okay
2017-09-18 16:09:40	merkazu	not a huge bother to recompile
2017-09-18 16:10:00	keveloper	Figured easy access would've been convenient :P
2017-09-18 16:10:25	merkazu	you know me, i like things the hard way ;)
2017-09-18 16:27:56	keveloper	:P
2017-09-18 16:28:14	keveloper	When you can tho, give my your brutally honest opinion of the redesign
2017-09-18 16:28:32	keveloper	I think this looks way more professional than the latter, but let's talk about it
2017-09-18 16:28:39	keveloper	I want this to be _perfect_ :)
2017-09-18 16:29:54	 *	merkazu jots a note to invite Gordon Ramsay along for the preview
2017-09-18 16:30:54	keveloper	yas \o/
2017-09-18 16:31:12	keveloper	"this redesign is......... the most brilliant PIECE OF GARBAGE I HAVE EVER SEEN"
2017-09-18 16:31:19	keveloper	i expect no less than that ^^^
2017-09-18 16:32:08	merkazu	"These icons, i can't tell if that's a caveman hunting a deer or that's supposed to describe the cloud!"
2017-09-18 16:32:45	keveloper	have you seen the key and peele skit making fun of food networking judges
2017-09-18 16:32:50	keveloper	network*
2017-09-18 16:32:59	merkazu	no, what's it called?
2017-09-18 16:33:06	keveloper	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPpzJAzdpTU
2017-09-18 16:33:09	keveloper	its incredible
2017-09-18 16:34:24	merkazu	is it just me or does he look like john boyega?
2017-09-18 16:34:33	keveloper	yeah a lil bit lol
2017-09-18 18:58:01	merkazu	it's RAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWW
2017-09-18 18:58:26	merkazu	my dad couldn't get out of work/other obligations so birthday plans are for the weekend
2017-09-18 18:59:47	merkazu	last change 19 days ago
2017-09-18 19:01:47	merkazu	oh, there's another branch
2017-09-18 19:02:16	merkazu	i... don't quite understand the middle section
2017-09-18 19:02:39	merkazu	the background moves... a little bit towards the center when you scroll down
2017-09-18 19:07:07	merkazu	there's a text orphan starting at 543px until 457px, i suggest typing "Business" with "with" via &nbsp; so those two go and fill out the third line together
2017-09-18 19:08:05	merkazu	i'm unsure about the current left alignment of the tagline as it reaches mobile
2017-09-18 19:08:52	merkazu	i feel like it might be a bit better if it was in a bit more towards the center as a whole around the <400 area
2017-09-18 19:10:26	merkazu	could use more spacing in between the auto-type section and the footer (the full width black component, not just the CTA to the footer
2017-09-18 19:11:13	merkazu	maybe 1.5-2em?
2017-09-18 19:13:25	merkazu	header, i feel is better, especially when it comes to the larger screens
2017-09-18 19:15:07	merkazu	the middle section in comparision does feel like it breaks up the page nicer compared to the current version due to the header
2017-09-18 21:06:22	merkazu	what if i told you i wanted to deploy the landing page, October first?
2017-09-18 21:07:11	merkazu	email capture and interest assessment at this point only
2017-09-18 21:22:15	keveloper	You still on here?
2017-09-18 21:22:42	keveloper	If so I'm headed to the gas station really quick I'll get back to you
2017-09-18 22:13:13	keveloper	The middle section is to break up the space without using just plain color
2017-09-18 22:13:19	keveloper	I took out the slide animation just now
2017-09-19 13:43:31	keveloper	Can you elaborate on what all would be included in the October release?
2017-09-19 13:43:37	keveloper	Is the pricing page included?
2017-09-19 13:44:10	keveloper	Any other work I need to do for that besides finish the landing page redesign and pricing page if needed?
2017-09-19 13:51:01	merkazu	Landing page. An email capture form and a basic single option pricing box. I'll also be working through some of the different footer stuff like legal, privacy policy, etc
2017-09-19 13:51:37	keveloper	Would I make the email capture form?
2017-09-19 13:52:00	merkazu	as far as what you'd need to do, if you want to continue on the landing page, that's fine. your work on the pricing page wouldn't be necessary on initial launch, we'll update when you're done and happy with it
2017-09-19 13:52:06	merkazu	email capture will be all me
2017-09-19 13:52:17	keveloper	Okay cool
2017-09-19 13:52:24	keveloper	I haven't styled an inputs yet do you want me to do that?
2017-09-19 13:52:49	keveloper	I can replace the bottom learn more the email capture or something
2017-09-19 13:53:01	keveloper	with the email**
2017-09-19 13:53:15	merkazu	nah, don't worry about that, the email capture will be behind the learn more buttons
2017-09-19 13:53:51	keveloper	okay
2017-09-19 13:53:56	merkazu	i'm mostly doing this for the kick in the pants to keep pushing forward and evaluating market need/desire
2017-09-19 13:55:37	merkazu	probably later into the year/early next year, i'll be looking at concierge building as devops isn't my strongest suit, but also to understand what people really need out of what i'm offering
2017-09-19 13:56:21	merkazu	live, grow, repeat, aye?
2017-09-19 14:01:07	keveloper	sounds good
2017-09-19 21:21:41	merkazu	A few more points of feedback
2017-09-19 21:22:12	merkazu	title caps in CTA, right now it looks like it's sentence caps.
2017-09-19 21:23:00	merkazu	maybe we can take a look into making the footer a bit more attractive later on
2017-09-19 21:23:16	merkazu	just seems unstyled compared to the rest
2017-09-19 21:24:06	merkazu	you know the icons next to the features? could we throw some color on that? like accessibility being blue (pretty common)
2017-09-19 21:24:37	merkazu	the learn more CTA is oddly timed compared to the rest of it. quite slow by comparison
2017-09-19 21:24:47	merkazu	both styles, original and redesign
2017-09-19 21:25:57	merkazu	a bit more outer padding on the highlight in the measurable impact would help cut down on the claustrophobia. it's hugging the text pretty close right now
2017-09-19 21:35:55	merkazu	just so you know, it's currently being hosted here: http://app-8b68b5fd-9db2-4281-9ccb-6aa149840103.cleverapps.io/
2017-09-19 21:36:06	merkazu	i'll continue to work on it as we go
2017-09-20 17:42:51	keveloper	Hey you there?
2017-09-20 17:43:10	keveloper	I'm a little confused what you mean about icon colors, did you mean something like this: https://cl.ly/3y1x0n3V2U1J
2017-09-20 17:57:21	keveloper	Here's another variation: https://cl.ly/2p280Y240T1B
2017-09-21 14:04:06	keveloper	If you're curious
2017-09-21 14:04:14	merkazu	hm?
2017-09-21 14:04:14	keveloper	He PM'd me this, which is what got him kicked: https://pastebin.com/L5cSgU6J
2017-09-21 14:04:15	keveloper	lol
2017-09-21 14:04:44	merkazu	snrk
2017-09-21 14:04:50	keveloper	I know right
2017-09-21 14:05:21	merkazu	could smell that one a mile away, hell, i was reading an article earlier about all of the ICO scams going on
2017-09-21 14:05:39	keveloper	Yeah idk man
2017-09-21 14:06:23	merkazu	finally got all of the deployment related issues hammered out last night, links not going where they should and all that
2017-09-21 20:12:12	merkazu	kinda like the variation with the colored headers personally
2017-09-21 20:12:23	merkazu	s/headers/rule
2017-09-22 18:35:22	merkazu	the dark blue/light blue for the bottom two are great
2017-09-22 18:35:57	merkazu	the orange is a bit outside the saturation zone for the others (throw these colors into LAB or HSV in Photoshop or GIMP respectively; working in RGB is terrible), and grey is a clear outlier.
2017-09-22 18:55:03	keveloper	Yeah I didn't really try to make the colors good I was just throwing together a POC
2017-09-22 19:38:19	merkazu	https://cl.ly/1d0y2h1g1010
2017-09-22 21:08:46	keveloper	Do those toggle on click?
2017-09-22 21:09:07	merkazu	they do not, but they do expand on hover
2017-09-22 21:09:27	merkazu	hover/focus anyway
2017-09-22 22:42:42	keveloper	I'd recommend using font-awesome's question mark: http://fontawesome.io/icon/question-circle/
2017-09-22 22:45:16	keveloper	Also I think that line-height is kinda small in the paragraphs
2017-09-23 11:00:55	merkazu	noted, I'll have you come in and clean everything up design wise and emily to clean up the copy later on
2017-09-23 20:06:57	keveloper	Okay sounds good
2017-09-26 19:52:40	keveloper	Trying something with a ciruit board here, idk how I feel about it though
2017-09-26 19:52:41	keveloper	https://cl.ly/1g3O153s1f1G
2017-09-26 19:54:55	merkazu	mmm
2017-09-26 19:57:46	keveloper	some changes: https://cl.ly/1i1J450o3f0K
2017-09-26 19:58:02	keveloper	Gradient and shadow help I think
2017-09-26 19:58:09	merkazu	yeah it does
2017-09-26 20:02:31	keveloper	What do you think
2017-09-26 20:03:48	merkazu	the concept is nice, but i think it'd work best as a standalone piece. maybe as an ad piece. that, combined with the header as is, feels like we might be pushing the circuits thing a bit too hard
2017-09-26 20:05:36	keveloper	Yeah
2017-09-26 20:06:58	keveloper	Welp back to where I was lol
2017-09-26 20:07:20	merkazu	are you conflicted on the current middle section?
2017-09-26 20:08:06	keveloper	https://cl.ly/210p0L2h2A0L
2017-09-26 20:08:15	keveloper	That's where I'm at right now
2017-09-26 20:08:20	keveloper	note that that's zoomed out
2017-09-26 20:08:31	merkazu	mmhm
2017-09-26 20:09:39	keveloper	thoughts?
2017-09-26 20:14:57	merkazu	it certainly fits the simplicity angle but does the original orange/black/blue from the first iteration need to change?
2017-09-27 09:05:36	keveloper	It was white in the first iteration
2017-09-27 09:05:51	keveloper	Since the header is now white it looks a lil weird being white
2017-09-27 09:06:25	keveloper	I'll keep chuggin on it though
2017-09-27 19:34:37	merkazu	hm, does emily have a sister?
2017-09-27 19:34:45	merkazu	came across an Alexis Yocum
2017-09-27 19:34:52	merkazu	on linkedin
2017-09-27 20:59:10	keveloper	nope
2017-09-27 20:59:21	 *	merkazu shrugs
2017-09-27 21:37:58	keveloper	well https://cl.ly/0t1k2T340M31
2017-09-27 21:38:02	keveloper	new idea
2017-09-27 21:38:05	keveloper	think youll like
2017-09-27 23:13:39	keveloper	New changes on the redesign branch
2017-09-27 23:13:46	keveloper	I think it is looking preeettty good
2017-09-27 23:19:34	keveloper	Note: Made the secondary color a tad darker, I think it really helps
2017-09-28 12:58:26	keveloper	Yoo
2017-09-28 13:28:26	merkazu	ayy
2017-09-28 13:38:23	keveloper	Let me know when you see the updates, I removed some clutter and changed up some things. I really like it
2017-09-28 13:38:28	keveloper	It's very clean and modern and professional imo
2017-09-28 13:39:07	keveloper	I'll do some spacing and text display clean up next hopefully tonight
2017-09-28 13:39:59	merkazu	okay, i'll review after gallery night events
2017-09-28 13:40:05	merkazu	might be late
2017-09-28 13:40:27	keveloper	nbd hopefully i'll have some changes pushed by then
2017-09-28 13:40:39	keveloper	imo it's at it's best state yet
2017-09-28 13:40:43	keveloper	quite proud :P
2017-09-28 13:40:50	merkazu	looking forward to it
2017-09-28 13:41:12	keveloper	The clip up there is one of the changes ^ (except its more drastic in the clip because of color differences)
2017-09-28 13:41:27	keveloper	Changed it a bit since then
2017-09-28 13:41:44	keveloper	But it adds some noise to the plain background and is much more interesting than the color background
2017-09-28 13:42:45	keveloper	I was wandering around on the cloudapp version you have hosted looking at the pages you'll have, let me know if you need help with any of them. I'm starting to derive a cohesive branding and styling for the pages
2017-09-28 13:43:18	merkazu	great, i'm glad it's accomplishing some sort of purpose already
2017-09-28 13:43:34	merkazu	yeah, I'll definitely need help with it as we go
2017-09-28 13:44:10	keveloper	Well not starting to derive but starting finalize what I've been wanting to create yanno
2017-09-28 21:04:43	merkazu	you still there?
2017-09-28 21:09:13	merkazu	so are the icons in the lower section supposed to have reverted to black and white?
2017-09-28 21:09:31	merkazu	and the middle section a series of large gray blocks?
2017-09-28 21:10:24	merkazu	https://cl.ly/1g3X273T1k2i
2017-09-28 21:55:55	keveloper	looool

2017-09-28 21:56:10	keveloper	wait what
2017-09-28 21:56:14	keveloper	that's not at all what it should look like
2017-09-28 21:56:26	merkazu	okay, i was a bit nervous, lol
2017-09-28 21:56:34	keveloper	yeah this is way off

2017-09-28 22:03:36	keveloper	i can fix that ezpz lol
2017-09-28 22:04:02	keveloper	aside from any minor defects lol
2017-09-28 22:04:06	keveloper	overall design
2017-09-28 22:04:13	keveloper	i really like the selling point section without lines
2017-09-28 22:04:15	keveloper	very clean
2017-09-28 22:04:17	merkazu	starting to occur after 1392px for me
2017-09-28 22:04:21	keveloper	still easily separated by heade
2017-09-28 22:04:24	merkazu	that breaking onto another line
2017-09-28 22:04:44	keveloper	breakpoint doesn't matter it's just the display property
2017-09-28 22:04:56	keveloper	had to do with the underline thing but that's gone now
2017-09-28 22:05:05	keveloper	if you scroll to mobile you'll see what it should look like
2017-09-28 22:05:10	keveloper	but that can be the permanent styling now
2017-09-28 22:05:11	merkazu	yeah, just trying to give a little assistance in tracking it down
2017-09-28 22:05:18	keveloper	no prob :)
2017-09-28 22:05:29	keveloper	i noticed that yesterday and was like "eh its fine for now"
2017-09-28 22:05:30	merkazu	so you decided to nix the colors on the icons?
2017-09-28 22:05:38	keveloper	i couldn't make it look good imo
2017-09-28 22:05:41	keveloper	i tried a lot of thing
2017-09-28 22:05:42	keveloper	s
2017-09-28 22:05:52	merkazu	aight, i'm in agreement
2017-09-28 22:06:02	keveloper	feel free to play with it
2017-09-28 22:06:12	merkazu	overall design looks nice
2017-09-28 22:06:34	keveloper	the headers with primary look decent
2017-09-28 22:06:36	keveloper	lemme clyp
2017-09-28 22:07:54	keveloper	https://cl.ly/1M0m3p0u391M
2017-09-28 22:09:10	keveloper	https://cl.ly/001Y2A2H101F
2017-09-28 22:09:40	keveloper	https://cl.ly/370z1m243e3O
2017-09-28 22:09:46	keveloper	Three alternatives
2017-09-28 22:09:50	keveloper	I like the secondd
2017-09-28 22:10:18	merkazu	the third, nixed imo
2017-09-28 22:10:23	keveloper	Yeah for sure
2017-09-28 22:10:33	keveloper	Just doing all the permuations lol
2017-09-28 22:10:41	keveloper	kind of like it without color the best
2017-09-28 22:10:49	keveloper	full primary is ok tho
2017-09-28 22:10:56	keveloper	lemme try secondary
2017-09-28 22:11:16	merkazu	first, i feel like would have some usability issues, the second is nice about the same level as the default all black
2017-09-28 22:11:31	keveloper	https://cl.ly/0p2P1W3L0Q2Z
2017-09-28 22:11:37	keveloper	usability issues?
2017-09-28 22:11:54	merkazu	yeah, bright font against white background
2017-09-28 22:12:20	keveloper	https://cl.ly/0r2J3z3v461B
2017-09-28 22:12:21	keveloper	Oh yeah
2017-09-28 22:12:28	merkazu	whereas the one you just put down has more contrast in general
2017-09-28 22:12:30	keveloper	It actually failed axe because of that
2017-09-28 22:12:47	keveloper	I actually like the 3rd one
2017-09-28 22:12:48	keveloper	most recent
2017-09-28 22:12:48	merkazu	axe?
2017-09-28 22:12:56	keveloper	accessibility tool
2017-09-28 22:13:05	keveloper	contrast wasn't great enough
2017-09-28 22:13:50	merkazu	https://cl.ly/0r2J3z3v461B, this one you liked or https://cl.ly/370z1m243e3O this one?
2017-09-28 22:14:10	keveloper	no no no no lol the first one
2017-09-28 22:14:12	keveloper	blue icon
2017-09-28 22:14:14	keveloper	dark font
2017-09-28 22:14:40	merkazu	yeah, i like it too
2017-09-28 22:14:57	merkazu	more so because then this section kinda weaves into the next one
2017-09-28 22:15:20	merkazu	you have a blue dominant field, then blue icon to dark text then a dark dominant field
2017-09-28 22:15:27	keveloper	yeah
2017-09-28 22:19:27	keveloper	how do you feel about the font
2017-09-28 22:19:29	keveloper	?
2017-09-28 22:19:44	keveloper	(did you notice i changed it)
2017-09-28 22:19:48	keveloper	i keep playing with fonts lol
2017-09-28 22:19:57	keveloper	I _really_ like it ont he logo right now
2017-09-28 22:20:15	merkazu	to be frank, i don't notice font changes too much. i'm a content guy
2017-09-28 22:20:29	keveloper	lol ok
2017-09-28 22:20:33	keveloper	i might play with it a bit more but
2017-09-28 22:20:44	keveloper	i _really_ like this over the old one
2017-09-28 22:20:47	keveloper	like a _LOT_
2017-09-28 22:20:48	merkazu	but i do like that it's nice and readable, non-serif
2017-09-28 22:21:05	keveloper	i was tabbing back and forth like "damn this is improved"
2017-09-29 09:32:34	keveloper	so im going out of town this weekend (save me i go out of town too much)
2017-09-29 09:32:41	keveloper	i'll be back sunday day
2017-09-29 09:32:46	merkazu	hehe
2017-09-29 09:32:51	merkazu	where you headed?
2017-09-29 09:32:55	keveloper	next goal is responsive clean up and spacing clean up
2017-09-29 09:32:59	keveloper	probably playing with more fonts
2017-09-29 09:33:18	keveloper	how do you feel about it's current state (ignoring minor defects)
2017-09-29 09:33:26	merkazu	i like it
2017-09-29 09:33:37	keveloper	cool
2017-09-29 09:33:41	merkazu	you okay with me going ahead and pulling it into the main source?
2017-09-29 09:34:04	keveloper	you might wanna wait until i'm finished but do what you want
2017-09-29 09:34:14	merkazu	okay then
2017-09-29 09:34:30	keveloper	well i'd imagine it's annoying to keep pulling changes for files after it's already merged with the actual source
2017-09-29 09:34:32	merkazu	i may as well wait myself as I'm still working out things like the analytics
2017-09-29 09:34:49	keveloper	there will be some small changes coming but beyond that nothing more
2017-09-29 09:34:56	keveloper	i haven't added my portfolio link yet i need to do that
2017-09-29 09:35:24	keveloper	need to find a nice place in the footer to do that without making anything unclean
2017-09-29 09:35:26	merkazu	how about I put it on a thanks page since there'll be one being developed anyway
2017-09-29 09:35:44	keveloper	Sounds good
2017-09-29 09:35:52	merkazu	same page for security researchers and other people who makes this possible
2017-10-01 20:32:32	keveloper	Hey you there?
2017-10-01 21:59:36	keveloper	Pushed some changes
2017-10-01 22:00:01	keveloper	I'm quite happy with the current state, let me know if you notice anything

2017-10-02 14:31:17	keveloper	Good to hear, I realllly like it especially compared to what I first gave you
2017-10-02 14:31:23	keveloper	Sorry about that
2017-10-02 14:31:43	merkazu	sorry about what? you have nothing to be sorry about
2017-10-02 15:28:30	keveloper	Delivering something good as it could be initially i mean
2017-10-02 15:30:16	merkazu	pff, this is probably your first major design job in a while isn't it?
2017-10-02 15:30:44	merkazu	i've fully accounted for things like that, i totally understand but don't beat yourself up over it
2017-10-02 15:31:09	keveloper	first major design job ever lol
2017-10-02 15:31:27	merkazu	well there you go, nothing to feel bad about

2017-10-02 15:37:51	merkazu	good to hear, i footed the bill for it plus the consultation to help him get out of unemployment
2017-10-02 15:38:06	merkazu	technically i'm also an entry level position :|
2017-10-02 15:38:14	keveloper	jeesh

2017-10-02 15:38:53	keveloper	i might try to get an offer so they counter offer but idk
2017-10-02 15:38:56	keveloper	a lot of stress there
2017-10-02 15:39:03	keveloper	i know i could be making quite a bit more ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-10-03 09:19:56	merkazu	hey kevin, you said OCLC was primarily Java, right?
2017-10-03 09:20:21	 *	merkazu debates about exploring options there
2017-10-03 09:24:57	keveloper	yeah most of it
2017-10-03 11:28:34	keveloper	so

2017-10-03 19:30:16	merkazu	oh, on your iceland trip, did you stop by the blue lagoon?
2017-10-03 23:13:16	keveloper	we did not, it's apparently pretty touristy and expensive
2017-10-03 23:13:22	keveloper	i heard it's not that cool but idk
2017-10-05 20:22:43	merkazu	blaaaah
2017-10-05 20:23:05	merkazu	content writing and finding good content writers is difficult
2017-10-06 00:10:51	keveloper	i dont have any referrals lol
2017-10-06 00:11:39	keveloper	so whats up with the prcing page shpupd i get started on that?
2017-10-06 00:11:53	keveloper	i still need to send a quote for that
2017-10-07 09:47:52	merkazu	yeah, i'm just going to write it myself for now. given the extremely data centric nature, i don't think a content writer would do too great of a job anyway
2017-10-07 15:54:19	keveloper	okay sounds good
2017-10-09 21:44:45	keveloper	Hey you there
2017-10-10 14:10:31	merkazu	so he started today huh?
2017-10-10 14:10:59	keveloper	yesterday
2017-10-10 14:11:32	merkazu	good, good
2017-10-10 14:11:39	keveloper	why what's up lol
2017-10-10 14:12:00	merkazu	oh no, no issues. i just like to check in on people i help out
2017-10-10 14:12:14	keveloper	was he having troubles finding a job?
2017-10-10 14:12:23	merkazu	unemployed for 8+ months
2017-10-10 14:12:31	keveloper	jeesh
2017-10-10 14:12:35	merkazu	was going to go down the path of becoming a line cook
2017-10-10 14:12:35	keveloper	do you know why?
2017-10-10 14:12:38	keveloper	unlucky?
2017-10-10 14:12:43	merkazu	i suppose so
2017-10-10 14:12:52	keveloper	i mean he seems good
2017-10-10 14:12:58	merkazu	also, his resume and all wasn't that great
2017-10-10 14:13:02	keveloper	yeah
2017-10-10 14:13:13	keveloper	he's obviously passionate and smart about cs/web dev
2017-10-10 14:13:23	keveloper	the hiring manager was more interested in passion than experience
2017-10-10 14:13:34	merkazu	dropped some cash for him to get resume writing services, linkedin help and interviewing help
2017-10-10 14:13:38	keveloper	and minty seems like the type of person who can easily learn
2017-10-10 14:13:55	keveloper	but yeah he randomly said 'anyone hiring?"
2017-10-10 14:13:55	merkazu	didn't disclose i covered the bills though
2017-10-10 14:13:57	keveloper	in webdev
2017-10-10 14:14:05	keveloper	and i was like "yep"
2017-10-10 14:14:30	merkazu	part of the training actually, being way more proactive about reaching out in the arenas you frequent
2017-10-10 14:14:33	keveloper	then i talked to him for a bit and sent his info to the manager and me and nathan were like "we think he'll be good" (but way more detailed) and apparently the interviews went well and poof now he's here
2017-10-10 14:14:55	merkazu	awesome
2017-10-10 14:15:26	keveloper	imo this company is awesome for experience especially for entry
2017-10-10 14:15:36	merkazu	i can imagine
2017-10-10 14:15:43	keveloper	a lot of complicated integrated applications working together, it ends up teaching you a lot
2017-10-10 14:15:51	keveloper	that and nathan are the only reason im decent lol
2017-10-10 14:15:59	merkazu	haha
