2016-11-22 14:11:11	na_th_an	it's possible we've crossed paths before
2016-11-22 14:11:26	na_th_an	I've known Bureaucat for like 11 years now
2016-11-22 14:11:33	awilfox	hm, I've gone by CorgiDude and Betawolf on various IRCs

2016-11-22 14:12:49	na_th_an	yeah same lol
2016-11-22 14:12:53	na_th_an	this was very random
2016-11-22 14:13:24	awilfox	this used to be about an OS project jessicah was writing called Snowflake but it kinda turned into a social channel at some point
2016-11-22 14:13:32	awilfox	we occasionally rant about how much writing for UEFI sucks
2016-11-22 14:13:37	awilfox	but otherwise social
2016-11-22 14:14:15	na_th_an	me and keveloper just rant about our shitty project to whoever will listen :)
2016-11-22 14:17:52	jessicah	:o

2016-11-22 14:18:06	keveloper	:o

2016-11-22 14:22:57	na_th_an	we came to remediate your OS project
2016-11-22 14:23:22	jessicah	;)
2016-11-22 14:23:48	jessicah	I work on haiku nowadays
2016-11-22 14:25:12	na_th_an	that project has always sounded really fun to work on to me
2016-11-22 14:25:19	na_th_an	I'm pretty far removed from the OS layer these days though
2016-11-22 14:26:09	jessicah	there are app layers and things to work on too
2016-11-22 14:27:26	jessicah	we still need to port stuff like libreoffice, node-webkit, etc
2016-11-22 14:28:05	jessicah	I'd like to see the latter so can run vscode on haiku :p
2016-11-22 14:28:23	jessicah	it's my favourite editor now
2016-11-22 14:29:39	jessicah	google code in starts next week... going to be super busy ;(
2016-11-22 14:33:32	awilfox	is that like gsoc but in the autumn?
2016-11-22 14:34:59	jessicah	yeah, but bite sized tasks, for 13-17 year old students
2016-11-22 14:36:10	jessicah	the need for lots of small tasks is what makes it a lot of work
2016-11-22 14:37:31	jessicah	feedback, review, walking students through things, thinking up new tasks as they work through stuff
2016-11-22 14:38:35	na_th_an	wow I wish I had that when I was a teen
2016-11-22 14:38:45	na_th_an	haiku does sound like it'd be a lot of fun to get into...
2016-11-22 14:39:26	jessicah	(:
2016-11-22 18:44:50	awilfox	I managed to port my Z80 emulator to Haiku
2016-11-22 18:45:07	awilfox	it has vim and a libc which is pretty much my development needs satisfied
2016-11-22 18:47:47	jessicah	:)
