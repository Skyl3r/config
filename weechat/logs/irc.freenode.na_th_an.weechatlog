I don't want to be in class either and I have homework I need to do tonight, but I'm here. It's not okay to miss classes and not say anything on a team project.

2015-11-19 11:16:44	na_th_an	The sexual connotations of the phrase "make out" appear to have developed in the 1930s and 1940s from the phrase's other meanings of "to succeed". Originally, it meant "to seduce" or "to have sexual intercourse with".[4]

2015-11-19 22:58:19	frappuccino	SBT (scala build tool) is like mvn, activator is a layer on top of that that includes play

2015-11-19 23:06:23	frappuccino	school plus another job
2015-11-19 23:06:33	frappuccino	mike said some mean comment about his resume
2015-11-19 23:06:37	frappuccino	i think it was supposed to be a joke
2015-11-19 23:06:42	frappuccino	but it did not seem like one lol
2015-11-19 23:07:05	na_th_an	do you know what it was
2015-11-19 23:07:13	frappuccino	yeah
2015-11-19 23:07:21	frappuccino	so he put costumer support on his resume on accient
2015-11-19 23:07:25	frappuccino	instead of customer
2015-11-19 23:07:25	na_th_an	mike's humor is pretty abrasive
2015-11-19 23:07:28	frappuccino	so mike pointed that out
2015-11-19 23:07:48	na_th_an	how did he point it out
2015-11-19 23:07:53	na_th_an	did he ask about his costuming experience
2015-11-19 23:07:54	frappuccino	and quinton was like "oh no! i changed that I swear! I might have lost the change when I was condensing it down from 2 pages to 1 page"
2015-11-19 23:07:57	na_th_an	because that would be fucking hilarious
2015-11-19 23:08:12	frappuccino	and mike was like "oh was the 2 page one the version where you tell us what you've done"
2015-11-19 23:08:19	frappuccino	implying that his resume sucked
2015-11-19 23:08:30	frappuccino	i forget the exact wording, quintons wording of it sounded harsher
2015-11-19 23:08:36	na_th_an	I'm literally laughing my ass off
2015-11-19 23:08:51	frappuccino	okay maybe for you because youve worked here and know mike
2015-11-19 23:08:52	na_th_an	he probably did think the resume was bad then
2015-11-19 23:08:55	frappuccino	but in an interview
2015-11-19 23:08:59	na_th_an	but I wouldn't worry about it
2015-11-19 23:09:03	frappuccino	hes in college lol
2015-11-19 23:09:05	frappuccino	he has a dev internship
2015-11-19 23:09:08	frappuccino	like its not a bad resume
2015-11-19 23:09:18	na_th_an	I never saw it so I can't say
2015-11-19 23:09:39	frappuccino	idk
2015-11-19 23:09:44	frappuccino	thats unnecssary to say
2015-11-19 23:09:50	na_th_an	no it kinda is
2015-11-19 23:09:55	na_th_an	I bet patrick said something to mike after about it
2015-11-19 23:09:57	na_th_an	amybe
2015-11-19 23:09:58	na_th_an	maybe
2015-11-19 23:10:06	frappuccino	quinton said there was like "heh" kinda laughs
2015-11-19 23:10:08	na_th_an	but that doesn't make it any less funny
2015-11-19 23:10:10	frappuccino	like it was very uncomfortable
2015-11-19 23:10:13	na_th_an	hmm
2015-11-19 23:10:20	na_th_an	who else was in it do you know
2015-11-19 23:10:21	frappuccino	but like it was supposed to be aj oke
2015-11-19 23:10:26	frappuccino	patrick and bill
2015-11-19 23:10:33	na_th_an	just those three?
2015-11-19 23:10:38	frappuccino	yeah
2015-11-19 23:10:48	frappuccino	btw one of my profs was like "people still use irc?" lol
2015-11-19 23:10:57	na_th_an	I think there's like a kinda weird dynamic where mike and pat's humor doesn't mix at all
2015-11-19 23:11:06	frappuccino	yeah i agree
2015-11-19 23:11:08	na_th_an	pat would make jokes and I would get them and be the only one
2015-11-19 23:11:14	frappuccino	patrick is great
2015-11-19 23:11:18	na_th_an	and I'd look at him and we'd exchange a look like "really only us get that"
2015-11-19 23:11:26	na_th_an	while mike would just keep talking
2015-11-19 23:11:48	frappuccino	jetbrains site has a little terminal that pops up in the bottom right for if you need help lol
2015-11-19 23:11:55	na_th_an	lol

2015-11-19 23:12:43	frappuccino	thats pretty uninterested

2015-11-19 23:13:32	na_th_an	the way you make it sound
2015-11-19 23:13:45	na_th_an	the "nah you're cool" is like a "nah you're cool keep talking" kind of thing
2015-11-19 23:13:59	na_th_an	when melissa first started talking to me she's like "sorry I keep talking I can let you go"
2015-11-19 23:14:03	na_th_an	and I'm like "no you're fine"
2015-11-19 23:14:10	na_th_an	I feel like it's that

2015-12-11 15:23:32	na_th_an	but no you didn't
2015-12-11 15:23:34	frappuccino	or
2015-12-11 15:23:35	frappuccino	whatever
2015-12-11 15:23:42	na_th_an	it's 12
2015-12-11 15:23:42	frappuccino	so
2015-12-11 15:23:49	na_th_an	window 12
2015-12-11 15:24:01	frappuccino	when people search for the country "deutschland" in IR it needs to search for germany
2015-12-11 15:24:08	na_th_an	yeah
2015-12-11 15:24:13	frappuccino	those are called synonyms i guess
2015-12-11 15:24:21	na_th_an	ok
2015-12-11 15:24:26	frappuccino	so someone implemented that recently in FIND and its awful
2015-12-11 15:24:32	na_th_an	k
2015-12-11 15:24:52	frappuccino	so i had to write a script to go through a file of synonyms and search all of them in FIND and check for the country code that I parsed out of a file and it was so fun
2015-12-11 15:25:17	frappuccino	it even writes logs to a directory that is timestamped and then there is are log,pass,fail,skip files
2015-12-11 15:25:47	frappuccino	i wrote a cool logger that puts everything in the log and to the terminal, and then sorts out the passes/fails/skips and puts those in their own log files
2015-12-11 15:25:54	na_th_an	neat
2015-12-11 15:25:54	frappuccino	and then the master log file has everything
2015-12-11 15:25:57	frappuccino	its so cool
2015-12-11 15:26:00	na_th_an	java?

2016-01-05 14:59:21	na_th_an	and I said that I wrote that I really liked her but figured nothing would probably happen between us
2016-01-05 14:59:25	na_th_an	I'm trying to journal more, yeah
2016-01-05 14:59:31	na_th_an	but anyway I said that to her
2016-01-05 14:59:35	frappuccino	does she know why
2016-01-05 14:59:37	na_th_an	and she looks down and goes "yeah... probably"
2016-01-05 14:59:47	na_th_an	and talked about how she was probably gonna stay with adam
2016-01-05 14:59:55	na_th_an	she's in new york with him right now
2016-01-05 15:00:01	frappuccino	this is dumb
2016-01-05 15:00:04	na_th_an	yeah
2016-01-05 15:00:27	na_th_an	I guess she did send me a snap last night but it was just a picture of extra credit from high school like "wasn't that nice back then"
2016-01-05 15:01:09	na_th_an	so yeah I doubt anything will happen with her despite how much I want something to happen
2016-01-05 15:01:33	na_th_an	I have a couple tinder matches that I haven't tried to message
2016-01-05 15:01:55	na_th_an	one match who messaged back once, and one match who never messaged back
2016-01-05 15:01:57	na_th_an	and that's my life
2016-01-05 15:03:11	frappuccino	well
2016-01-05 15:03:22	frappuccino	i dont like tinder
2016-01-05 15:03:26	frappuccino	i dont think its very effective
2016-01-05 15:03:34	na_th_an	I'm not going to meet anyone any other way any time soon
2016-01-05 15:03:46	frappuccino	i know right

2016-01-05 15:04:35	frappuccino	its probably not a good idea
2016-01-05 15:04:41	frappuccino	i feel like im in too deep though
2016-01-05 15:04:45	na_th_an	it isn't a good idea and you know it
2016-01-05 15:05:02	frappuccino	its going pretty well so far...
2016-01-05 15:05:15	frappuccino	she came to my friends house on new years eve and just sat there pissed off
2016-01-05 15:05:29	frappuccino	so i was texting her like "whats wrong is everything okay?" and she never responded
2016-01-05 15:05:32	frappuccino	but was texting other people
2016-01-05 15:06:01	frappuccino	and i would like try to talk to her and she would be really rude
2016-01-05 15:06:02	frappuccino	idk
2016-01-05 15:06:22	na_th_an	sounds healthy
2016-01-05 15:06:27	na_th_an	like other stories you've told me about her
2016-01-05 15:06:48	frappuccino	she got mad at me for going on a date someone while we werent talking
2016-01-05 15:07:00	na_th_an	also healthy and a good thing
2016-01-05 15:07:39	frappuccino	then that girl randomly snapchatted me and lindsey got mad
2016-01-05 15:07:46	frappuccino	and she was like "its obvious you like her"
2016-01-05 15:07:50	frappuccino	and i was like "no i dont"
2016-01-05 15:08:13	frappuccino	the snapchat was a star wars movie and it said "finally"
2016-01-05 15:08:25	frappuccino	because one time i gave her shit for not seeing starwars
2016-01-05 15:08:44	frappuccino	but anyway so lindsey was like "you guys are obviously still talking" and i was like "well she's not so"
2016-01-05 15:08:48	frappuccino	we're not*
2016-01-05 15:09:23	frappuccino	she didn't even ask any questions first, she saw the snapchat and went straight to "fuck you why are you talking to her" and i was like "what"
2016-01-05 15:10:05	na_th_an	:(
2016-01-05 15:10:14	frappuccino	its very demeaning

2016-01-05 15:10:48	frappuccino	there's still that one time when she told me she was going to run her car off the road and it would be my fault
2016-01-05 15:11:00	na_th_an	yeah you really need to cut contact with her

2016-01-05 15:12:24	frappuccino	she also really likes revenge
2016-01-05 15:12:47	frappuccino	during the "why is she snapchatting you" thing she added some guy that asked her on a date and texted him
2016-01-05 15:12:51	frappuccino	for revenge
2016-01-05 15:13:10	frappuccino	i don't know how to get out of it

2016-01-05 15:14:47	na_th_an	I drank a LOT last semester
2016-01-05 15:14:59	na_th_an	I learned I can drink a fifth of booze in 2 days
2016-01-05 15:15:43	frappuccino	thats not a good thing
2016-01-05 15:16:04	na_th_an	in some ways it is
2016-01-05 15:16:06	frappuccino	everytime i try to end it she freaks out
2016-01-05 15:16:10	frappuccino	i need to like
2016-01-05 15:16:12	frappuccino	write a note
2016-01-05 15:16:16	frappuccino	she always takes over arguments
2016-01-05 15:16:25	na_th_an	text her or leave a message
2016-01-05 15:16:28	frappuccino	its not a like a take turns kind of argument
2016-01-05 15:16:31	na_th_an	then block her number and block her on facebook
2016-01-05 15:16:37	na_th_an	cut contact with her
2016-01-05 15:16:41	na_th_an	seriously
2016-01-05 15:16:46	frappuccino	this is frustrating though

2016-01-05 15:29:50	frappuccino	 did you know that your iPhone is actually manufactured by Samsung? Every single hardware part and your phone aside from the camera sensor is Samsung technology 
2016-01-05 15:29:53	frappuccino	lol
2016-01-05 15:29:59	na_th_an	lol
2016-01-05 15:30:01	frappuccino	pseudofact

2016-01-05 15:33:57	frappuccino	Really not in the mood to deal with you doing something that you know pisses me off so I gotta go, bye  
2016-01-05 15:34:04	frappuccino	because i said "lol"
2016-01-05 15:34:10	frappuccino	she gets mad when i say "lol" in a text
2016-01-05 15:34:27	frappuccino	well not lol in a text but a text that is "lol"
2016-01-05 15:34:28	frappuccino	you get it
2016-01-05 15:35:41	na_th_an	to take a line from King of the Hill
2016-01-05 15:35:51	na_th_an	when somebody is serving up humble pie, why do you keep going for seconds?
2016-01-05 15:36:00	frappuccino	what
2016-01-05 15:36:04	frappuccino	humble pie
2016-01-05 15:36:27	frappuccino	who is being humble
2016-01-05 15:36:48	na_th_an	oh there's a word for this
2016-01-05 15:36:55	na_th_an	mishearing something a lot
2016-01-05 15:36:57	na_th_an	anyway
2016-01-05 15:37:10	na_th_an	wait no
2016-01-05 15:37:14	na_th_an	humble pie is correct
2016-01-05 15:37:18	na_th_an	it comes from umble pie
2016-01-05 15:37:19	frappuccino	i dont get it
2016-01-05 15:37:24	frappuccino	how does this apply
2016-01-05 15:37:30	na_th_an	The expression derives from umble pie, which was a pie filled with the chopped or minced parts of a beast's 'pluck' - the heart, liver, lungs or 'lights' and kidneys, especially of deer but often other meats. Umble evolved from numble, (after the French nomble) meaning 'deer's innards'.[1][2]
2016-01-05 15:37:41	na_th_an	she's serving up shit you don't want but you keep coming back for more
2016-01-05 15:38:02	frappuccino	i dont get the humble part
2016-01-05 15:38:04	frappuccino	but anyway
2016-01-05 15:38:10	na_th_an	because the pie is shitty
2016-01-05 15:38:13	na_th_an	you don't want that pie
2016-01-05 15:38:16	frappuccino	i dont
2016-01-05 15:38:39	na_th_an	humble like she's humbling you
2016-01-05 15:38:44	na_th_an	she's trying to make you feel like shit
2016-01-05 15:38:48	na_th_an	she's serving you humble pie
2016-01-05 15:39:07	frappuccino	okay
2016-01-05 15:39:09	frappuccino	got it
2016-01-05 15:39:15	frappuccino	great quote btw
2016-01-05 15:39:26	na_th_an	not sure if sarcastic
2016-01-05 15:39:36	frappuccino	yes
2016-01-05 15:39:44	na_th_an	it is a great quote
2016-01-05 15:39:48	na_th_an	you just didn't understand the idiom
2016-01-05 15:39:57	na_th_an	it's 100% relevant here too
2016-01-05 15:40:04	frappuccino	okay anyway
2016-01-05 15:40:07	frappuccino	what do i do
2016-01-05 15:40:15	frappuccino	what are the chances of it getting better
2016-01-05 15:40:17	frappuccino	probably low
2016-01-05 15:40:17	na_th_an	0
2016-01-05 15:40:21	na_th_an	they won't
2016-01-05 15:40:24	na_th_an	are you kidding
2016-01-05 15:40:24	frappuccino	either way, i shouldnt hope
2016-01-05 15:40:32	na_th_an	she responds to "lol" with that
2016-01-05 15:40:39	frappuccino	true
2016-01-05 15:40:44	na_th_an	how much time have you spent with this girl?
2016-01-05 15:40:56	na_th_an	and her immediate reaction to a snap from some other girl you don't even like was what?
2016-01-05 15:40:58	frappuccino	on and off for 3 years
2016-01-05 15:41:07	na_th_an	honestly
2016-01-05 15:41:09	frappuccino	3 and a half years
2016-01-05 15:41:22	na_th_an	you should just block her number, block her on facebook, and try to never have contact with her again
2016-01-05 15:41:48	frappuccino	i mean ihave to say something first
2016-01-05 15:41:54	na_th_an	ehhhh
2016-01-05 15:42:02	na_th_an	you can but you really don't have to
2016-01-05 15:42:13	na_th_an	maybe send a text "we're through, don't contact me"
2016-01-05 15:42:21	frappuccino	like "yo sorry for accidentally kind of getting back together for the 50th time"
2016-01-05 15:42:25	frappuccino	i cant be that cold to her
2016-01-05 15:42:34	na_th_an	"hey sorry you're fucking crazy and I'm not talking to you any more"
2016-01-05 15:42:38	frappuccino	nope
2016-01-05 15:42:43	na_th_an	"in your future relationships try to be less abusive"
2016-01-05 15:42:57	frappuccino	nope
2016-01-05 15:42:59	na_th_an	this girl deserves none of your time
2016-01-05 15:43:01	na_th_an	none of your energy
2016-01-05 15:43:04	na_th_an	none of your emotions
2016-01-05 15:43:07	na_th_an	she deserves nothing from you
2016-01-05 15:43:10	frappuccino	i think you are being a bit harsh
2016-01-05 15:43:22	na_th_an	I think your judgement is being severly clouded
2016-01-05 15:43:31	na_th_an	and if you talked to abby about this situation she'd say the exact same stuff
2016-01-05 15:44:00	na_th_an	if you made a post on /r/relationships about your ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP they'd tell you the same things
2016-01-05 15:45:08	frappuccino	probably
2016-01-05 15:45:29	frappuccino	i also think itd be better for her if we didnt talk 
2016-01-05 15:45:37	na_th_an	in the same way that lindsey is a textbook abuser, you are the textbook abusee
2016-01-05 15:45:45	frappuccino	we've been doing the same thing for like 3 years, its obviously not going anywhere
2016-01-05 15:45:49	frappuccino	what
2016-01-05 15:45:50	na_th_an	no, it isn't
2016-01-05 15:45:53	na_th_an	and it's not going to get better
2016-01-05 15:45:59	frappuccino	what
2016-01-05 15:46:02	frappuccino	i said if we didnt talk
2016-01-05 15:46:12	na_th_an	it's not going anwyhere
2016-01-05 15:46:14	frappuccino	like itd be healthier for her to stop talking to me
2016-01-05 15:46:16	na_th_an	I'm agreeing
2016-01-05 15:46:19	frappuccino	oh
2016-01-05 15:46:20	frappuccino	yeah
2016-01-05 15:46:21	frappuccino	oh okay
2016-01-05 15:46:21	na_th_an	and it would be better for her to not talk to you
2016-01-05 15:46:33	na_th_an	it would be better for both of you
2016-01-05 15:46:37	frappuccino	i dont think she would be this abusive to someone else

2016-01-05 15:49:47	frappuccino	idk about that
2016-01-05 15:49:51	frappuccino	i dont think our past is good
2016-01-05 15:50:05	na_th_an	you're forgetting bad things that happened and it makes your past look better than it was
2016-01-05 15:50:29	frappuccino	should i just be like

2016-01-05 15:52:33	na_th_an	still
2016-01-05 15:52:37	frappuccino	like she knows that I know she has really bad anxiety
2016-01-05 15:52:47	frappuccino	also
2016-01-05 15:52:55	frappuccino	i think she thinks im mad at her
2016-01-05 15:53:00	frappuccino	so she might be trying to make me not mad at her
2016-01-05 15:53:27	frappuccino	i dont want to abruptly be like "we're done"
2016-01-05 15:53:36	na_th_an	yeah so what are you gonna do

2016-01-05 15:54:01	frappuccino	she told me she was coming over
2016-01-05 15:54:08	frappuccino	and i was like "no im about to go to bed"
2016-01-05 15:54:19	frappuccino	and she was like no im coming over and i was like "dont come over"
2016-01-05 15:54:21	frappuccino	and she came over
2016-01-05 15:54:24	frappuccino	and then wouldnt leave
2016-01-05 15:54:32	frappuccino	shit her sweater is in my dresser
2016-01-05 15:54:43	frappuccino	she's gonna ask to get it
2016-01-05 15:54:49	frappuccino	i kind of think she put it there for that reason
2016-01-05 15:54:50	na_th_an	so you give it to a friend
2016-01-05 15:54:55	na_th_an	and have that friend give it to her
2016-01-05 15:55:03	na_th_an	I'll do it
2016-01-05 15:55:14	frappuccino	i could just put it in her mailboxx
2016-01-05 15:55:22	na_th_an	that's a federal offense
2016-01-05 15:55:31	frappuccino	why
2016-01-05 15:55:34	frappuccino	i mean i know but
2016-01-05 15:55:51	na_th_an	mailboxes are like, legally federal property or something dumb like that
2016-01-05 15:56:03	na_th_an	it's illegal to put anything but mail in them
2016-01-05 15:56:08	na_th_an	and illegal for anyone but USPS to put mail in them
2016-01-05 15:56:09	frappuccino	bleh
2016-01-05 15:56:16	frappuccino	this is shitty of me to do
2016-01-05 15:56:22	na_th_an	no it isn't
2016-01-05 15:56:22	frappuccino	because i always know it wont work
2016-01-05 15:56:27	frappuccino	but i got back in it somehow
2016-01-05 15:56:29	frappuccino	she initiated it thoug
2016-01-05 15:56:30	na_th_an	it's shitty of her to do this shit to you
2016-01-05 15:56:48	na_th_an	you don't need this in your life
2016-01-05 15:58:18	frappuccino	im trying to list things she does
2016-01-05 15:59:26	na_th_an	google for some sign of abusive relationships
2016-01-05 16:01:44	frappuccino	"blame you for their own abusive behavior" is on there
2016-01-05 16:16:34	frappuccino	welp
2016-01-05 16:16:38	frappuccino	this is what i have so far
2016-01-05 16:16:39	frappuccino	http://pastebin.com/7BXNT7Eq
2016-01-05 16:17:18	frappuccino	excessively jealous*
2016-01-05 16:18:11	na_th_an	seems pretty good
2016-01-05 16:18:18	frappuccino	should i add more
2016-01-05 16:18:36	na_th_an	"This isn't up for discussion. I'm blocking your number."
2016-01-05 16:18:44	frappuccino	true
2016-01-05 16:21:52	na_th_an	yo so you know how I broke up with Haley right
2016-01-05 16:22:01	frappuccino	yeah
2016-01-05 16:22:15	na_th_an	well obv people keep asking me why and I always give them some half truth answers
2016-01-05 16:22:30	na_th_an	but the more I think about it the more I think the real reason that I ended it with her
2016-01-05 16:22:50	na_th_an	is because she cut her hair and I was totally unattracted to her for like 2 years because of it
2016-01-05 16:23:10	na_th_an	I told I didn't really like short hair and I wasn't sure how I'd feel if she got it, but it's her hair etc
2016-01-05 16:23:16	na_th_an	and she got it cut really really short eventually
2016-01-05 16:23:53	na_th_an	and I think I resented her more and more over time because I really liked her and wanted the relationship to work but was totally unattracted to her physically
2016-01-05 16:24:22	na_th_an	and I think that resentment grew over time to the point where I just didn't ever want to be with her
2016-01-05 16:24:59	na_th_an	I tried to get her to do some things that would maybe make me feel more attracted to her but she never ever did
2016-01-05 16:25:15	na_th_an	she graduated college wearing the same clothes that she wore when we started dating
2016-01-05 16:25:35	na_th_an	she doesn't own one single cute piece of underwear
2016-01-05 16:25:39	frappuccino	http://pastebin.com/05tu6UYh
2016-01-05 16:25:40	frappuccino	udpated
2016-01-05 16:25:58	na_th_an	and the more I think about it the more I think that's what eventually caused me to break up with her
2016-01-05 16:26:25	frappuccino	attraction is very important
2016-01-05 16:26:41	na_th_an	that seems good though
2016-01-05 16:26:44	frappuccino	and a major change to your appearance like that will most likely alter your SOs attraction to you
2016-01-05 16:27:14	frappuccino	I didn't want to seem accusing
2016-01-05 16:27:23	frappuccino	like I understand I have most likely hurt her multiple time
2016-01-05 16:27:24	frappuccino	s
2016-01-05 16:27:28	frappuccino	and she might think i am abusive
2016-01-05 16:27:34	frappuccino	and that only helps my case
2016-01-05 16:27:47	na_th_an	I think you were more apologetic than you have to be
2016-01-05 16:27:54	na_th_an	you're good
2016-01-05 16:28:45	frappuccino	sent
2016-01-05 16:28:59	na_th_an	\o/

2016-01-05 16:30:30	na_th_an	I've felt at least some of that feel every day for months
2016-01-05 16:30:40	frappuccino	at least I typed it out and it was explained and not just "bye"
2016-01-05 16:31:19	na_th_an	now block her number
2016-01-05 16:31:21	frappuccino	my mom said to me a couple weeks ago "im worried about you and that lindsey girl, just from some things you told me. I don't want her to bring you down"
2016-01-05 16:31:23	frappuccino	that got me

2016-01-05 17:00:22	na_th_an	I doubt she would

2016-01-06 10:27:55	na_th_an	me too
2016-01-06 10:27:59	na_th_an	you did the right thing tho
2016-01-06 10:28:11	na_th_an	I wonder if anyone dislikes the sound of my keyboard
2016-01-06 10:28:18	frappuccino	i wonder that somtimes
2016-01-06 10:28:23	frappuccino	if people next to me can hear it
2016-01-06 10:28:32	na_th_an	mine isn't very loud
2016-01-06 10:28:36	frappuccino	i should put a sign
2016-01-06 10:28:41	na_th_an	I'm trying to get better at not bottoming out too
2016-01-06 10:28:53	na_th_an	they're not clicky, it could be worse
2016-01-06 10:28:55	na_th_an	we're not mike
2016-01-06 10:28:56	frappuccino	i am too but then again its just so nice
2016-01-06 10:29:08	frappuccino	its so satisfying
2016-01-06 10:29:12	na_th_an	I don't think it's unreasonable to use mx browns
2016-01-06 10:29:15	na_th_an	at all
2016-01-06 10:29:20	na_th_an	and I'm very noise concious
2016-01-06 10:29:29	frappuccino	i try to not bottom out
2016-01-06 10:29:34	frappuccino	i dont think i did during that sentence
2016-01-06 10:29:36	frappuccino	or that one
2016-01-06 10:29:38	na_th_an	it's pretty hard
2016-01-06 10:29:42	na_th_an	when you're not thinking about it
2016-01-06 10:29:47	frappuccino	yeah
2016-01-06 10:29:49	na_th_an	I at least try not to bottom out super hard
2016-01-06 10:30:01	frappuccino	yeah if im just typing i totally bottom out
2016-01-06 10:30:06	frappuccino	i might get o rings
2016-01-06 10:30:16	na_th_an	I wanna try them
2016-01-06 10:30:17	na_th_an	I'm interested
2016-01-06 10:30:32	na_th_an	I also wanna build my own keyboard
2016-01-06 10:30:33	frappuccino	it just keeps you from bottoming out right
2016-01-06 10:31:00	na_th_an	o-rings?
2016-01-06 10:31:06	frappuccino	yeah
2016-01-06 10:31:10	na_th_an	they're supposed to dampen bottoming out so it doesn't make as much noise
2016-01-06 10:31:22	na_th_an	you can find comparison videos for cherry mx browns on youtube I'm sure
2016-01-06 10:32:59	frappuccino	i just watched one
2016-01-06 10:33:04	frappuccino	i dont think mine is that loud
2016-01-06 10:33:14	frappuccino	now that im just typing without headphones, it kind of is
2016-01-06 10:33:18	frappuccino	idk about outside of my cube though
2016-01-06 10:33:23	frappuccino	you should walk by lol
2016-01-06 10:33:55	na_th_an	I def type louder with headphones on
2016-01-06 10:34:02	frappuccino	true

2016-01-06 10:45:25	frappuccino	did you see obama's executive order for gun safety or whatevz
2016-01-06 10:53:13	na_th_an	I heard a little bit about it
2016-01-06 10:53:17	na_th_an	background checks
2016-01-06 10:53:28	na_th_an	I don't really have a problem with it tbh but I don't know that much
2016-01-06 10:53:45	na_th_an	I'm relatively pro gun ownership but I really hate how some people approach gun control
2016-01-06 11:06:39	frappuccino	oh snap

2016-01-06 11:08:46	frappuccino	operations or whatever
2016-01-06 11:08:48	na_th_an	devops
2016-01-06 11:08:52	na_th_an	middleware
2016-01-06 11:08:54	frappuccino	yeah
2016-01-06 11:08:56	frappuccino	so
2016-01-06 11:09:14	frappuccino	they are starting to try to analyze how effecient scrum teams are or sometthing
2016-01-06 11:09:22	na_th_an	yeah
2016-01-06 11:09:26	na_th_an	I saw the thing he's doing
2016-01-06 11:09:27	frappuccino	and my team is one of the first ones or something
2016-01-06 11:09:34	na_th_an	yeah
2016-01-06 11:09:34	frappuccino	is he also doing it on your team
2016-01-06 11:09:37	frappuccino	did you get the email
2016-01-06 11:09:46	na_th_an	no I didn't
2016-01-06 11:09:48	frappuccino	oh
2016-01-06 11:09:57	frappuccino	well yeah so they're doing it with my team
2016-01-06 11:10:06	frappuccino	and they are asking things like "how often do your devs commit code" and stuff
2016-01-06 11:10:18	frappuccino	and people are on my team are not supportive lol
2016-01-06 11:10:31	frappuccino	the whole team is bitching in an email
2016-01-06 11:10:32	na_th_an	how surprising
2016-01-06 11:10:38	na_th_an	I kinda wanna see
2016-01-06 11:10:40	na_th_an	can you forward it to me
2016-01-06 11:10:59	frappuccino	"Also because the result will apparently be some sort of score of our team.  They will take that view that one size fits all.  We may all be evaluated against Discovery’s practices, which isn’t completely fair since they have an entire team just to worry about ‘innovation’."
2016-01-06 11:11:01	frappuccino	said my manager
2016-01-06 11:11:14	na_th_an	that's literally exactly what patrick said they aren't doing
2016-01-06 11:11:19	frappuccino	whaht
2016-01-06 11:11:28	na_th_an	the score isn't about comparing teams to other teams
2016-01-06 11:11:31	na_th_an	but measing improvement
2016-01-06 11:11:33	na_th_an	measuring*
2016-01-06 11:11:46	na_th_an	that way patrick can say "see, they're more agile now than they were a month ago"
2016-01-06 11:11:52	frappuccino	he apparently didnt make that clear
2016-01-06 11:12:07	na_th_an	he's very open to working with teams in areas they want to improve rather than telling them what they should do
2016-01-06 11:12:14	frappuccino	"We don’t unit test.  We don’t code review.  We don’t do a lot of things that are commonplace around OCLC.  We’re gonna get ripped apart.    Shrug."
2016-01-06 11:12:18	frappuccino	said a dev
2016-01-06 11:12:27	na_th_an	SHRUG IS YOUR ATTITUDE TO THAT
2016-01-06 11:12:29	na_th_an	what a shitty dev
2016-01-06 11:12:37	na_th_an	I bet s/he writes great code
2016-01-06 11:12:39	frappuccino	he's not a shitty dev
2016-01-06 11:12:45	frappuccino	he does write good code lol
2016-01-06 11:12:48	na_th_an	that's a shitty attitude
2016-01-06 11:12:49	frappuccino	our team is weird
2016-01-06 11:12:57	frappuccino	how
2016-01-06 11:13:17	na_th_an	but anyway, he literally said when he was explaining this to us that if a team scores a 2 right now and they get to an 8 or something shitty than that's fine
2016-01-06 11:13:20	na_th_an	it's improvement
2016-01-06 11:13:35	na_th_an	there are some things that improve code quality. Shrugging off those things is a shitty attitude.
2016-01-06 11:13:49	frappuccino	he's not shrugging off those things
2016-01-06 11:14:00	frappuccino	he's shrugging the fact that we're gonna get a shitty score
2016-01-06 11:14:19	frappuccino	we have a bunch of random products that have been thrown upon us because of the nature of what our team is
2016-01-06 11:14:23	na_th_an	yeah
2016-01-06 11:14:27	frappuccino	we have 3 full time devs and me
2016-01-06 11:14:41	frappuccino	and a bunch of products
2016-01-06 11:14:58	frappuccino	one of the devs isnt even working on our team right now because he got pulled away
2016-01-06 11:14:59	na_th_an	from the email it sounds like he's the kind of dev that doesn't give a shit about code reviews and static analysis tools
2016-01-06 11:15:14	frappuccino	thats not correct
2016-01-06 11:15:27	na_th_an	it's like when we could have had a consistent style across AE stuff but there was no actual adoption of any checkstyle rules
2016-01-06 11:15:35	na_th_an	but patrick was like "whatever idc"
2016-01-06 11:21:23	frappuccino	meh
2016-01-06 11:25:43	frappuccino	omg yesterday
2016-01-06 11:25:54	frappuccino	this guy on my team was telling me to do something
2016-01-06 11:26:09	frappuccino	in which i had to ssh to something and change a file in a tomcat webapp
2016-01-06 11:26:23	frappuccino	except i didnt know what he was telling me to do
2016-01-06 11:26:49	frappuccino	so he was like do you have access to this machine? and i was like "i dont think so"
2016-01-06 11:27:11	frappuccino	but then he just told me a username and password they all use any way so yes i had access to the machine
2016-01-06 11:27:12	frappuccino	so
2016-01-06 11:27:43	frappuccino	instead of telling my to ssh he was like "go to terminal"
2016-01-06 11:27:53	frappuccino	except he has an indian accent so i couldn't understand him
2016-01-06 11:28:01	frappuccino	so I was like "what?"
2016-01-06 11:28:16	frappuccino	then he was like "go to terminal, its an application"
2016-01-06 11:28:25	frappuccino	and i was like "oh terminal, okay"
2016-01-06 11:28:50	frappuccino	then he was like "connect to the machine" and i was like using what
2016-01-06 11:28:57	frappuccino	and he was like "type s"
2016-01-06 11:29:00	frappuccino	"s-h"
2016-01-06 11:29:05	frappuccino	and i was like oh ssh okay
2016-01-06 11:29:27	frappuccino	so i typed ssh holland@whatever.whatever
2016-01-06 11:29:34	frappuccino	and he was like no the user is blah
2016-01-06 11:29:42	frappuccino	so i was like okay and fixed
2016-01-06 11:29:54	frappuccino	and then it took a minute to get the password because i couldnt understand him
2016-01-06 11:30:07	frappuccino	so anyway im connected now
2016-01-06 11:30:31	frappuccino	and then he tells me to go to the tomcat directory and im like how the hell would i know where that is
2016-01-06 11:30:38	frappuccino	so then he gets me there
2016-01-06 11:30:44	frappuccino	then he's like "open that file"
2016-01-06 11:30:51	frappuccino	and i was like "what?"
2016-01-06 11:30:57	frappuccino	like open it with what
2016-01-06 11:31:02	frappuccino	and then he was like "type v"
2016-01-06 11:31:04	frappuccino	"i"
2016-01-06 11:31:18	frappuccino	and im like oh okay now i get what you are asking
2016-01-06 11:31:28	frappuccino	and then i edit and save and shit and it was just frustrating
2016-01-06 11:31:32	frappuccino	i think he thought i was clueless
2016-01-06 11:32:03	frappuccino	he could have just been like "ssh to this host with user and pass, go to this dir, change this file"
2016-01-06 11:38:09	na_th_an	omg wall of text
2016-01-06 11:38:12	na_th_an	this is gonna tae a minute
2016-01-06 11:39:23	na_th_an	lol
2016-01-06 11:39:31	na_th_an	that's like the opposite of trying to get faisal to do things
2016-01-06 11:39:38	na_th_an	I would be helping him and be like "ssh into this machine"
2016-01-06 11:39:43	na_th_an	and it'd be the opposite
2016-01-06 11:39:51	na_th_an	where I'd have to be like "do you have any ssh installed"
2016-01-06 11:39:55	frappuccino	what kind of phone does claudia have
2016-01-06 11:39:56	na_th_an	and then we'd go download putty
2016-01-06 11:39:59	na_th_an	i have no idea
2016-01-06 11:40:08	na_th_an	she's a white college girl so I'd bet an iphone

2016-01-06 11:40:22	frappuccino	i texted her "when are you coming back"
2016-01-06 11:40:25	frappuccino	and she said "never"
2016-01-06 11:40:29	na_th_an	:'(
2016-01-06 11:40:31	frappuccino	and i said ":O"

When I go to the Ask Skip page I would like to be greeted by a photo of at least twice the size, with twice the staring depth. I would really like you to stare much deeper into my soul. Please let me know."

2016-02-03 11:36:52	frappuccino	that's how I judge whether or not something is good
2016-02-03 11:36:57	frappuccino	if someone else looked at it would they be impressed
2016-02-03 15:36:44	frappuccino	lol "these niggas actin like they signin the declaration of independence"
2016-02-03 15:36:48	frappuccino	a comment on the tidal video
2016-02-03 15:37:36	frappuccino	"this is a historical day" lol
2016-02-03 15:37:49	frappuccino	"this movement feels so eagel-ous" lol
2016-02-03 15:39:33	frappuccino	lol keep your emotions in your music because you guys do not understand business or marketing or anything besides art apparently lol
2016-02-03 15:39:42	frappuccino	i forgot how funny this is
2016-02-03 15:40:32	na_th_an	can I cite tidal as the reason I don't like jay-z
2016-02-03 15:40:34	na_th_an	is that ok
2016-02-03 15:40:43	frappuccino	yes lol
2016-02-03 15:41:15	frappuccino	like did they actually think they were changing the world or did they all know they were all full of shit
2016-02-03 15:42:24	frappuccino	artist getting paid more is cool (does that actually happen?) but being humble about a good idea is probably a good idea lol
2016-02-03 15:42:53	frappuccino	imagine if when github came out they made some obnoxious video about changing the world lol
2016-02-03 15:44:03	na_th_an	pretty sure tidal is shit for artists
2016-02-03 15:44:13	frappuccino	wtf lol
2016-02-03 15:44:13	na_th_an	possibly because nobody uses it
2016-02-03 15:44:28	na_th_an	it at least isn't amazing
2016-02-03 15:44:30	frappuccino	and streaming was kind of saturated when they arrived
2016-02-03 15:44:31	na_th_an	or really great
2016-02-03 15:44:41	na_th_an	yeah they had a decent idea with the hi-fi audio
2016-02-03 15:44:45	na_th_an	but $20/mo is WAY too much
2016-02-03 15:44:53	frappuccino	$240 a year lolol
2016-02-03 15:44:55	na_th_an	I'm their perfect target audience
2016-02-03 15:45:02	na_th_an	and I have NO interest in their service
2016-02-03 15:45:08	frappuccino	I'm sure they're music options aren't great too
2016-02-03 15:45:11	na_th_an	yeah
2016-02-03 15:45:19	na_th_an	there are some exclusives but not a lot of stuff
2016-02-03 15:45:20	frappuccino	google play is great
2016-02-03 15:45:24	frappuccino	apple music is great
2016-02-03 15:45:48	frappuccino	apple music does this cool thing where they put up an album of an artist before it released but the tracks that haven't been released yet or grayed out
2016-02-03 15:46:01	frappuccino	are grayed out*
2016-02-03 15:46:06	frappuccino	I thought it was cool
2016-02-05 11:19:48	frappuccino	lindsey texted me from like 4 different numbers last night

2016-02-05 11:27:48	na_th_an	or like, if something happens have some kind of record that she's crazy and harrassing you
2016-02-05 11:27:53	na_th_an	so that you don't get blamed for something she does
2016-02-05 11:28:37	na_th_an	you don't want her to like, show up and claim you hit her or something
2016-02-05 11:29:17	frappuccino	i am never going to meet up with her in person
2016-02-05 11:29:43	na_th_an	you won't purposely
2016-02-05 11:29:48	frappuccino	im dropping off her stupid mario kart on her door step and noping away forever
2016-02-05 11:29:49	na_th_an	but she knows where you live and go to school and stuff
2016-02-05 11:29:54	frappuccino	yeah she did show up at my house

2016-02-05 14:58:39	na_th_an	he's wearing some costume walking around yelling "ASK ME ABOUT MY TESLA"

2016-02-05 15:00:35	frappuccino	http://thebreakthrough.org/images/main_image/south_park_smug_prius.png
2016-02-05 15:00:39	na_th_an	he's like "is everything alright?"
2016-02-05 15:00:50	na_th_an	I'm like "ya I just gotta add fluids to it pretty often. It's old you know"
2016-02-05 15:01:02	na_th_an	he said "oh ok. Yeah, I don't have to do any of that stuff any more."
2016-02-05 15:01:18	na_th_an	and he stopped talking and I waited until it was slightly awkward and said
2016-02-05 15:01:27	na_th_an	"oh yeah?"
2016-02-05 15:01:36	na_th_an	he's like "yeah I don't have to do oil or gas or anything"
2016-02-05 15:01:43	na_th_an	I said "How do you get away with the no gas thing?"
2016-02-05 15:01:47	na_th_an	and he's like "TESLA"

2016-02-26 13:46:44	frappuccino	lol
2016-02-26 13:46:48	na_th_an	that's what matters
2016-02-26 13:47:00	frappuccino	yeah when mike pointed things out i was like "oh yep woops"
2016-02-26 14:10:16	frappuccino	is your hourly like $28.85?
2016-02-26 14:10:48	frappuccino	how did your part time work?
2016-02-26 14:10:52	frappuccino	you were paid for 20 hours right
2016-02-26 14:12:52	na_th_an	I did 12 hours a week
2016-02-26 14:13:15	frappuccino	so you got $28.85 for those 12 a week?
2016-02-26 14:13:21	na_th_an	idk
2016-02-26 14:13:28	frappuccino	do you remember what you pay checks were?
2016-02-26 14:13:30	frappuccino	every 2 weeks?
2016-02-26 14:13:37	frappuccino	were they like $800
2016-02-26 14:14:38	na_th_an	uhhh I can't really remember
2016-02-26 14:14:45	frappuccino	aw
2016-02-26 14:14:47	frappuccino	i wanna know lol
2016-02-26 14:15:01	na_th_an	I also like, never really got a normal paycheck
2016-02-26 14:15:09	na_th_an	with like, a full month of normal working
2016-02-26 14:15:09	frappuccino	what do you mean
2016-02-26 14:15:12	na_th_an	or maybe I did
2016-02-26 14:15:15	frappuccino	oh
2016-02-26 14:15:16	frappuccino	idk
2016-02-26 14:15:17	frappuccino	oh well
2016-02-26 14:15:24	frappuccino	i just wanted to know what to expect
2016-02-26 14:15:25	na_th_an	I think I might have gotten like $900 for the 12 hours?
2016-02-26 14:15:38	frappuccino	you said your salary is 60 right?
2016-02-26 14:15:40	frappuccino	60 flat?

2016-02-26 14:15:47	frappuccino	cool
2016-02-26 14:16:00	frappuccino	that puts you at 28.85 an hour i think
2016-02-26 14:16:13	na_th_an	30 days in a month - 8 days for weekends = 22 work days
2016-02-26 14:16:26	na_th_an	22 work days * 8 hours = 176 hours a month
2016-02-26 14:16:47	na_th_an	I get paid about 3450 after taxes
2016-02-26 14:16:51	na_th_an	and that's about $20/hr

2016-02-26 14:17:04	frappuccino	28.4 before taxes
2016-02-26 14:17:08	na_th_an	so your hourly would be slightly higher

2016-03-02 09:57:02	frappuccino	and then i told him about my trade-in and that i'll probably take it to carmax, and he was like "yeah carmax will probably give you more, so if you bring the carmax appraisal we'll match you. i'll give you a couple thousand off to get you out here"
2016-03-02 09:57:35	frappuccino	he really wants to steal columbus business lol

2016-03-02 09:58:28	frappuccino	if i can get them to
2016-03-02 10:00:41	na_th_an	I can't believe you're going to get a new car
2016-03-02 10:00:58	frappuccino	i'm still gonna look at some used
2016-03-02 10:01:47	na_th_an	I feel like I could have gotten a less expensive car than I did
2016-03-02 10:01:54	na_th_an	I really dig the car I got tho
2016-03-02 10:01:59	na_th_an	the bluetooth is nice

2016-03-02 10:04:27	na_th_an	it's really nice
2016-03-02 10:04:56	na_th_an	a lot of people recommend getting a ground loop isolator. I went ahead and got one just in case. My car doesn't seem to need it but I'm using it anyway
2016-03-02 10:05:09	frappuccino	so like i didn't copy the last 13 characters of the url but it still worked
2016-03-02 10:05:21	na_th_an	yeah that's stuff about my search refinements

2016-03-02 10:06:00	frappuccino	hey i see from the pictures that a push to start comes with it
2016-03-02 10:06:00	na_th_an	and also I have it set as a trusted device so my phone unlocks
2016-03-02 10:06:20	frappuccino	yep i like that feature

2016-03-02 14:01:17	na_th_an	if they weren't gonna hire you, you'd hear back pretty quick though
2016-03-02 14:01:23	na_th_an	she probably isn't
2016-03-02 14:01:27	frappuccino	true
2016-03-02 14:01:39	frappuccino	even if disco doesn't hire me there's a spot on SS

2016-03-02 14:01:52	na_th_an	and be like
2016-03-02 14:01:52	frappuccino	:P
2016-03-02 14:01:54	na_th_an	"I'm so disco"
2016-03-02 14:01:57	na_th_an	in your cube
2016-03-02 14:01:59	frappuccino	then they'll be like
2016-03-02 14:02:01	frappuccino	heres your job
2016-03-02 14:02:08	frappuccino	na_th_an: lets buy one for disco
2016-03-02 14:02:20	na_th_an	I'm down
2016-03-02 14:02:29	frappuccino	lets spread the beanie baby love through discovery lol
2016-03-02 14:02:38	frappuccino	everyone must have a beanie baby on their monitor
2016-03-02 14:36:20	frappuccino	found the exact one I want with the lighting package and everything in lousivlle for $21851
2016-03-02 14:40:03	na_th_an	add like another $3k on that with taxes and fees and shit probably
2016-03-02 14:40:11	na_th_an	there might be an additional tax for buying out of state
2016-03-02 14:40:49	frappuccino	after dealer discounts and talking down and college grad discount I'd be about the same
2016-03-02 14:40:51	frappuccino	probably less
2016-03-02 14:41:06	frappuccino	tax would be the only significant thing
2016-03-02 16:54:45	frappuccino	my method doc is legit amirite http://pastebin.com/cKkXeukH
2016-03-02 17:00:47	na_th_an	why did you send that to me
2016-03-02 17:00:53	na_th_an	and why in pm
2016-03-02 17:00:57	frappuccino	lol
2016-03-02 17:01:04	frappuccino	im just sharing my doc with you
2016-03-02 17:01:09	frappuccino	i haven't docd in a long time
2016-03-02 17:01:10	na_th_an	also
2016-03-02 17:01:20	frappuccino	waht\
2016-03-02 17:01:20	na_th_an	if you have a rest controller that always returns the same code
2016-03-02 17:01:35	frappuccino	same code? like status code?
2016-03-02 17:01:56	na_th_an	you can use @ResponseStatus to set the status code
2016-03-02 17:02:05	frappuccino	cool
2016-03-02 17:02:58	na_th_an	and on those methods you can just return a Map<String, Object> like you have there
2016-03-02 17:03:13	na_th_an	you should probably change the method signature to return the interface (Map) instead of the implementation (HashMap)
2016-03-02 17:03:26	frappuccino	why
2016-03-02 17:03:34	na_th_an	on methods where you want to manually set the status code you should return a ResponseEntity<Map<String,Object>>
2016-03-02 17:04:26	frappuccino	why ResponseEntity
2016-03-02 17:04:27	frappuccino	what is that
2016-03-02 17:04:54	na_th_an	because your implementation of your controller doesn't depend on the implementation of map that you want to use
2016-03-02 17:04:59	na_th_an	also
2016-03-02 17:05:01	frappuccino	instead of passing the HttpServletResponse?
2016-03-02 17:05:08	na_th_an	responseentity basically holds a status code and payload
2016-03-02 17:05:13	na_th_an	I showed you an example of that before
2016-03-02 17:05:23	frappuccino	I'll change that tomorrow
2016-03-02 17:05:24	frappuccino	im leavin

2016-04-06 15:13:07	na_th_an	they make you do exit counciling and part of it is some loan payment analysis
2016-04-06 15:13:17	na_th_an	like if you make X payments you are done in Y years and pay Z in interest
2016-04-06 15:13:17	frappuccino	who is they
2016-04-06 15:13:31	na_th_an	if you took public federal loans you're going to have to do it
2016-04-06 15:13:36	na_th_an	stafford exit counseling
2016-04-06 15:13:39	frappuccino	i don't think i did

2016-04-06 15:14:05	na_th_an	that's the federal loan wahtever
2016-04-06 15:14:07	na_th_an	it's just an internet thing
2016-04-06 15:14:10	frappuccino	oh
2016-04-06 15:14:12	frappuccino	phew

2016-04-06 15:23:28	frappuccino	or whatever that would be called
2016-04-06 15:24:26	na_th_an	ovh
2016-04-06 15:24:47	na_th_an	it's v nice
2016-04-06 15:24:57	na_th_an	my VPN connection has been stable
2016-04-06 15:25:04	frappuccino	do companies actually pay companies to host dedicated servers
2016-04-06 15:25:54	frappuccino	dedicated cloud is $573 a month
2016-04-06 15:25:55	frappuccino	lol
2016-04-06 15:26:19	na_th_an	for most companies it makes a lot more sense to use a hosting provider rather than run your own datacenter
2016-04-06 15:26:23	na_th_an	economy of scale and whatnot
2016-04-06 15:26:30	na_th_an	not to mention things like scalability, DDOS prevention, etc
2016-04-06 15:26:40	frappuccino	wtf is a vps cloud
2016-04-06 15:26:56	na_th_an	dedicated server -> running on hardware
2016-04-06 15:27:11	na_th_an	virtual server -> running in a VM/container on hardware with many other virtual servers
2016-04-06 15:27:21	na_th_an	so a VPS cloud is a cloud with VPS backends
2016-04-06 15:27:23	na_th_an	rather than dedicated
2016-04-06 15:27:51	frappuccino	and a dedicated cloud is a cloud with dedicated server backends
2016-04-06 15:27:58	frappuccino	so a VPS cloud has a bunch of VPS's
2016-04-06 15:28:10	frappuccino	OpenStack KVM
2016-04-06 15:28:10	frappuccino	1 vCore
2016-04-06 15:28:10	frappuccino	2.4 GHz
2016-04-06 15:28:10	frappuccino	2 GB RAM
2016-04-06 15:28:10	frappuccino	10 GB SSD
2016-04-06 15:28:10	frappuccino	Local RAID 10
2016-04-06 15:28:13	frappuccino	is that what you have
2016-04-06 15:28:26	na_th_an	sounds right
2016-04-06 15:28:29	na_th_an	it's like $3/mo
2016-04-06 15:28:34	frappuccino	budgetvms uptime is so good tho
2016-04-06 15:28:47	na_th_an	ovh is better
2016-04-06 15:29:01	na_th_an	my budgetvm rebooted at least 3 times without me knowing
2016-04-06 15:29:08	frappuccino	at budgetvm i ahve 1gb ram, 100gb hardrive
2016-04-06 15:29:11	frappuccino	dont think its an ssd
2016-04-06 15:29:17	na_th_an	it isn't
2016-04-06 15:29:28	frappuccino	100 Mbps
2016-04-06 15:29:30	frappuccino	whats ovh
2016-04-06 15:29:40	frappuccino	same
2016-04-06 15:30:32	na_th_an	I paid for 3 months at once bc they don't have automatic payments :(
2016-04-06 15:30:36	frappuccino	you runnin arch
2016-04-06 15:30:50	na_th_an	yaya
2016-04-06 15:30:54	frappuccino	do you have snapshot backup
2016-04-06 15:30:57	na_th_an	no
2016-04-06 15:31:01	frappuccino	i kinda wan that
2016-04-06 15:31:05	frappuccino	in case i just fuck it up
2016-04-06 15:31:05	na_th_an	do it yourself
2016-04-06 15:31:09	na_th_an	or not
2016-04-06 15:31:10	frappuccino	where
2016-04-06 15:31:11	frappuccino	yeah
2016-04-06 15:31:13	frappuccino	u rite
2016-04-06 15:31:13	frappuccino	idk
2016-04-06 15:31:20	na_th_an	I mean it'd be easier to use theirs
2016-04-06 15:31:36	na_th_an	but it wouldn't be hard to set up a cron job to do a remote backup once you have your apartment
2016-04-06 15:31:45	na_th_an	just use rsync to do a difference sync
2016-04-06 15:31:47	na_th_an	over ssh
2016-04-06 15:32:05	frappuccino	its suprising that its not cheaper to do longer lease
2016-04-06 15:32:22	na_th_an	with ovh?
2016-04-06 15:32:25	frappuccino	yeah
2016-04-06 15:32:27	na_th_an	I think it is
2016-04-06 15:32:30	frappuccino	its not
2016-04-06 15:32:45	na_th_an	are you sure? I swear I got a discount when I renewed
2016-04-06 15:32:53	frappuccino	yeah
2016-04-06 15:33:16	frappuccino	its all just month_price * lease_length
2016-04-06 15:33:22	frappuccino	for 1 3 6 12
2016-04-06 15:33:29	na_th_an	oh yeah I guess so
2016-04-06 15:33:39	frappuccino	i might do 3 months
2016-04-06 15:33:44	na_th_an	I'd recommend it
2016-04-06 15:33:48	na_th_an	it's only $10.47
2016-04-06 15:33:57	frappuccino	yeah
2016-04-06 15:34:03	frappuccino	i'll do it in the next week
2016-04-06 15:34:07	na_th_an	what distro
2016-04-06 15:34:12	frappuccino	debian probs idk
2016-04-06 15:34:24	frappuccino	i dont have much experience with anything else
2016-04-06 15:34:26	na_th_an	try arch bae
2016-04-06 15:34:29	na_th_an	arch really isn't hard
2016-04-06 15:34:35	na_th_an	and they do like 99% of the work
2016-04-06 15:34:40	na_th_an	and then you have access to the arch wiki
2016-04-06 15:34:42	frappuccino	hmm
2016-04-06 15:34:55	na_th_an	if you don't like it blow it away and install debian
2016-04-06 15:35:06	na_th_an	I've had 0 issues with Arch on OVH
2016-04-06 15:35:23	na_th_an	I'm pretty sure I just had to log in through the control panel and set up a user
2016-04-06 15:35:28	frappuccino	arch is just arch?
2016-04-06 15:35:30	frappuccino	no version?
2016-04-06 15:35:35	na_th_an	arch is rolling release
2016-04-06 15:35:44	frappuccino	coool
2016-04-06 15:35:53	frappuccino	debain 7 sucks
2016-04-06 15:35:59	frappuccino	everything i try to install on here goes wrong
2016-04-06 15:36:01	frappuccino	because debian 7
2016-04-06 15:36:05	na_th_an	I've never been a fan of debian
2016-04-06 15:36:08	na_th_an	it's /okay/
2016-04-06 15:36:18	na_th_an	it's good if you want a stable server with out of date software
2016-04-06 15:36:18	frappuccino	yeah i'll get 3 months on arch in the next week
2016-04-06 15:36:25	frappuccino	i'll launch pernt on it lol
2016-04-06 15:36:49	frappuccino	spring boot/spring mvc/kotlin/postgres
2016-04-06 15:36:49	na_th_an	pernt?
2016-04-06 15:36:58	frappuccino	the js drawing app im making
2016-04-06 15:37:01	na_th_an	oh
2016-04-06 15:37:05	frappuccino	there's gonna be a backend for sharing drawing
2016-04-06 15:37:05	frappuccino	s
2016-04-06 15:37:25	frappuccino	GUID after url kinda thing
2016-04-06 15:37:52	na_th_an	UUID
2016-04-06 15:38:02	frappuccino	same thing
2016-04-06 15:38:03	na_th_an	I was curious bc I didn't know so I just googled it
2016-04-06 15:38:09	na_th_an	GUID is the Microsoft implementation of GUID
2016-04-06 15:38:14	frappuccino	GUID is just global
2016-04-06 15:38:14	na_th_an	err of UUID
2016-04-06 15:38:25	na_th_an	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/246930/is-there-any-difference-between-a-guid-and-a-uuid
2016-04-06 15:38:26	frappuccino	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_unique_identifier
2016-04-06 15:38:29	na_th_an	"GUID is Microsoft's implementation of the UUID standard.
2016-04-06 15:38:50	frappuccino	oh i thought they were synonmous
2016-04-06 15:39:02	na_th_an	Just like microsoft to take something that works everywhere (the universe) and make it work in a very small subset (the globe) :)
2016-04-06 15:39:04	na_th_an	lol

2016-04-15 10:37:19	na_th_an	well she almost just went home when it came up but she was too drunk to drive
2016-04-15 10:37:28	na_th_an	she did end up still sleeping in my bed
2016-04-15 10:37:30	na_th_an	nobody slept on the couch
2016-04-15 10:37:34	na_th_an	but she's pretty hurt and mad at me
2016-04-15 10:37:41	frappuccino	i mean, that happened a long time ago
2016-04-15 10:38:04	frappuccino	i've been through a lot of shitty relationship bullshit and that is not really something that she can be mad/upset about...
2016-04-15 10:38:17	na_th_an	idk I don't think she's in the wrong
2016-04-15 10:38:26	frappuccino	upset i guess, but it happened 1) like 5 months ago and 2) when you guys weren't dating
2016-04-15 10:38:29	na_th_an	it was a week after we broke up and I was in our bed and I kissed some girl
2016-04-15 10:38:47	frappuccino	so what, it could've been a lot worse
2016-04-15 10:38:54	frappuccino	and still, it's not like you cheated on her
2016-04-15 10:39:00	na_th_an	no I didn't
2016-04-15 10:39:03	frappuccino	and it doesn't really matter considering that happened like 5 months ago
2016-04-15 10:39:03	na_th_an	I think it'll be okay
2016-04-15 10:39:13	na_th_an	it matters if it matters to her

2016-04-15 10:39:45	na_th_an	"your feelings are invalid" and "well I guess I'm done if this bothers you" are both not options
2016-04-15 10:40:14	frappuccino	i didn't say those were options lol
2016-04-15 10:40:36	na_th_an	but yeah she's pretty upset and I'm pretty worried about it all

2016-04-15 14:19:02	frappuccino	it says "use command line client: svn"
2016-04-15 14:19:10	frappuccino	and if i do svn --version, it says 1.9
2016-04-15 14:21:38	frappuccino	idk i did it in the command line
2016-04-15 14:21:41	frappuccino	we'll see if it works

2016-04-20 14:20:05	frappuccino	i don't like how its not just install remove or whatever
2016-04-20 14:20:08	na_th_an	it's pretty easy
2016-04-20 14:20:08	frappuccino	-S bleh
2016-04-20 14:20:10	na_th_an	pacman -S
2016-04-20 14:20:14	na_th_an	pacman -R
2016-04-20 14:20:16	na_th_an	pacman -Syu
2016-04-20 14:20:17	frappuccino	what is -S
2016-04-20 14:20:21	na_th_an	sync
2016-04-20 14:20:23	frappuccino	oh
2016-04-20 14:20:27	na_th_an	pacman -Sc clears old packages from the cache
2016-04-20 14:20:27	frappuccino	see thats not memorable
2016-04-20 14:20:33	na_th_an	eh
2016-04-20 14:20:37	na_th_an	it's fine
2016-04-20 14:20:44	frappuccino	install is just so obvious
2016-04-20 14:20:51	na_th_an	a lot more characters to type
2016-04-20 14:21:11	frappuccino	i guess so, but they could have at least had a verbose command along with the flag
2016-04-20 14:21:15	frappuccino	for us people who forget things
2016-04-20 14:21:16	frappuccino	amirite

2016-04-22 11:19:28	frappuccino	shouldn't that be .data(

2016-04-22 11:19:40	na_th_an	yeah probably
2016-04-22 11:19:48	frappuccino	idk where to test that
2016-04-22 11:19:57	frappuccino	unit tests might handle it?
2016-04-22 11:19:59	na_th_an	when you click 'place hold'
2016-04-22 11:20:06	na_th_an	it does directs you to login

2016-04-22 11:26:16	frappuccino	its comparing a string to a string some I'm gonna say it works
2016-04-22 11:38:37	frappuccino	$input.attr('data-bad', true);
2016-04-22 11:38:45	frappuccino	is that setting 'data-bad' to true?
2016-04-22 11:38:53	frappuccino	yeah it is
2016-04-22 11:39:10	frappuccino	should that be data because its using an object rather than a string

2016-05-16 10:33:08	na_th_an	where you can add and remove columns
2016-05-16 10:33:10	na_th_an	isn't that sweet
2016-05-16 10:33:20	frappuccino	yeah thats cool
2016-05-16 10:33:37	frappuccino	i need to make something cool
2016-05-16 10:47:26	na_th_an	what if chris invites new interns to #internlandia and we don't like them and then we have to go make #fulltimelandia and not tell them about it
2016-05-16 10:47:39	frappuccino	lol
2016-05-16 10:47:40	frappuccino	may happen
2016-05-16 10:47:43	na_th_an	#salarylandia
2016-05-16 10:47:47	frappuccino	lol
2016-05-16 10:47:53	frappuccino	i mean we might have to
2016-05-16 10:47:57	frappuccino	not a big deal though
2016-05-16 10:48:02	na_th_an	yeah
2016-05-16 10:48:03	frappuccino	except for the channel config you did
2016-05-16 10:48:11	frappuccino	auto op with oclc IP etc.
2016-05-16 10:48:11	na_th_an	that's like one command
2016-05-16 10:48:13	na_th_an	to set options
2016-05-16 10:48:15	na_th_an	oh
2016-05-16 10:48:20	na_th_an	well that's not hard either
2016-05-16 10:48:37	frappuccino	magic_conch you just have to change to point at the new channel
2016-05-16 10:48:37	frappuccino	or both
2016-05-16 10:48:42	frappuccino	i kinda want that
2016-05-16 10:48:47	frappuccino	so there are two channels
2016-05-16 10:48:58	frappuccino	intern and fulltime
2016-05-16 10:49:10	frappuccino	remember that only dev interns will come to irc
2016-05-16 10:49:25	frappuccino	or at least technical
2016-05-16 10:52:30	frappuccino	bill said you could help me get started on this
2016-05-16 10:52:30	frappuccino	https://jira.oclc.org/browse/DA-20513
2016-05-16 10:53:20	na_th_an	ya so
2016-05-16 10:53:28	na_th_an	right now when you search
2016-05-16 10:53:29	frappuccino	this is DUI correct
2016-05-16 10:53:36	na_th_an	I think this will reach into DS
2016-05-16 10:53:53	na_th_an	right now you can do a search and have multiple databases in your search right
2016-05-16 10:54:01	frappuccino	yeah
2016-05-16 10:54:08	na_th_an	then you can scope down and say "only this database"
2016-05-16 10:54:11	na_th_an	or remove a database right
2016-05-16 10:54:14	frappuccino	is OrderedSearchFactory.java in DS
2016-05-16 10:54:16	na_th_an	drill down
2016-05-16 10:54:17	frappuccino	thats from your comment
2016-05-16 10:54:21	frappuccino	okay
2016-05-16 10:54:39	na_th_an	so when you do that, DUI sends an index parameter for that database
2016-05-16 10:54:45	na_th_an	like pa:some_database_symbol
2016-05-16 10:54:54	na_th_an	ok so
2016-05-16 10:55:01	na_th_an	it still sends ALL of the database IDs to firefly
2016-05-16 10:55:04	na_th_an	when you scope down
2016-05-16 10:55:09	na_th_an	that's the first issue that needs to be fixed
2016-05-16 10:55:14	na_th_an	and that's not really documented
2016-05-16 10:55:28	frappuccino	is DS an API
2016-05-16 10:55:32	frappuccino	or REST services
2016-05-16 10:55:33	frappuccino	or what
2016-05-16 10:55:35	na_th_an	DS is DiscoveryServices
2016-05-16 10:55:38	frappuccino	yeah i know
2016-05-16 10:55:46	na_th_an	it's and HTTP service
2016-05-16 10:55:49	na_th_an	I don't know a lot about it
2016-05-16 10:56:06	na_th_an	but the first thing that needs to be done is to only send the databases that are currently selected in the x-info-5-dblist parameter to firefly
2016-05-16 10:56:35	na_th_an	once the firefly request is fixed then the rest of the proquest shit can be fixed
2016-05-16 10:56:43	na_th_an	but if we don't fix that then the database names are still messed up
2016-05-16 10:57:29	frappuccino	and thats in DUI
2016-05-16 10:58:14	na_th_an	it might involve DUI and DS
2016-05-16 10:58:31	na_th_an	it's something that should probably be discussed with a tech lead on how it should be implemented
2016-05-16 10:58:54	na_th_an	there's a lot of shit that went down with that ticket and trying to get it fixed. I don't think anyone besides me and bridget really know about that database issue
2016-05-16 10:59:10	frappuccino	hm okay
2016-05-16 10:59:28	frappuccino	i forgot that DUI wasn't on ubiquity yet so I did an rm -rf on it and now i have to re check it out lol
2016-05-16 11:03:41	frappuccino	so you made a change and then it was rolled back?
2016-05-16 11:04:42	na_th_an	ya
2016-05-16 11:04:49	na_th_an	I made a bunch of changes and they were rolled back
2016-05-16 11:04:59	frappuccino	why
2016-05-16 11:05:06	na_th_an	bc we don't have git
2016-05-16 11:05:09	na_th_an	and we had to release
2016-05-16 11:05:15	frappuccino	oh lol
2016-05-16 11:05:25	na_th_an	and we kept discovering more shit that was fucked
2016-05-16 11:05:33	frappuccino	so a different fix has to happen?
2016-05-16 11:05:41	na_th_an	no more fixes
2016-05-16 11:05:52	na_th_an	fixing the problem described in the ticket exposes another problem
2016-05-16 11:05:54	frappuccino	is your fix still here
2016-05-16 11:05:59	na_th_an	no it was rolled back
2016-05-16 11:06:01	frappuccino	okay
2016-05-16 11:06:32	frappuccino	so I just swap lines 42 and 44
2016-05-16 11:07:00	na_th_an	yeah that'll "fix" the problem
2016-05-16 11:07:10	na_th_an	the properties file still needs to be fixed because it has old data
2016-05-16 11:07:20	na_th_an	and idealy we would also fix the shit code that's in there
2016-05-16 11:12:22	frappuccino	pbcopy is sweet, ive never used it
2016-05-16 11:12:43	na_th_an	ya it is
2016-05-16 11:12:55	frappuccino	do you do like "pwd | pbcopy" and stuff
2016-05-16 11:13:24	na_th_an	ya sometimes
2016-05-16 11:13:37	frappuccino	how can you echo the output of something
2016-05-16 11:13:44	na_th_an	huh
2016-05-16 11:13:54	frappuccino	i wanna do pwd + ls | pbcopy
2016-05-16 11:13:55	frappuccino	bascially
2016-05-16 11:14:06	na_th_an	pwd + ls?
2016-05-16 11:14:14	frappuccino	there's one file in the dir
2016-05-16 11:14:21	frappuccino	how do you get the path of one file
2016-05-16 11:14:39	na_th_an	echo `pwd`/`ls``
2016-05-16 11:14:52	na_th_an	extra ` at the end there
2016-05-16 11:14:55	na_th_an	but I think that'd work
2016-05-16 11:14:58	na_th_an	at least in bash
2016-05-16 11:15:01	na_th_an	idk how to fish
2016-05-16 11:20:54	frappuccino	echo (pwd)/(ls)
2016-05-16 11:21:01	frappuccino	in fish
2016-05-16 11:21:08	frappuccino	echo (pwd)/(ls) | pbcopy
2016-05-16 11:21:12	frappuccino	got what i wanted
2016-05-16 12:53:17	frappuccino	do you care about spoilers
2016-05-16 12:53:42	na_th_an	I'm probably not ever going to see civil war
2016-05-16 12:53:45	frappuccino	okay so
2016-05-16 12:53:50	frappuccino	there's this contraversial thing
2016-05-16 12:53:59	frappuccino	and captain america takes what looks like as the "bad" or "criminal" side
2016-05-16 12:54:13	frappuccino	and tony stark is like "stop you are a criminal now" and such lol
2016-05-16 12:54:16	frappuccino	but it turns out that
2016-05-16 12:54:21	frappuccino	captain america was right the whole time
2016-05-16 12:54:50	frappuccino	because america is neverw rong
2016-05-16 12:55:21	frappuccino	captain america was like defending this worldwide wanted terrorist guy
2016-05-16 12:55:27	frappuccino	because it used to be his friend
2016-05-16 12:55:40	frappuccino	but he was really just a russian brainwashed super soldier
2016-05-16 12:55:49	frappuccino	and he was activated by some 10 word prhase or something
2016-05-16 12:56:04	frappuccino	and captain america just knew that he was still "himself"
2016-05-16 12:56:11	frappuccino	so he defended him
2016-05-16 12:56:17	na_th_an	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_agent
2016-05-16 12:56:18	frappuccino	and everyone else was like stop that guy needs to be in prison
2016-05-16 12:56:20	frappuccino	yeah that
2016-05-16 12:56:34	frappuccino	but cap was right! :D he is never wrong ya know! :D
2016-05-16 12:56:38	frappuccino	i hate captain america lol
2016-05-16 12:56:46	frappuccino	tony stark is cool af
2016-05-16 12:56:47	frappuccino	and flawed
2016-05-16 12:56:49	frappuccino	like EVERY HUMAN
2016-05-16 12:56:56	frappuccino	and his character is great
2016-05-16 12:57:00	frappuccino	and he's like depressed all thet ime
2016-05-16 12:57:04	frappuccino	he is a real character
2016-05-16 16:10:19	frappuccino	emily is doing a learn to code thing
2016-05-16 16:10:21	frappuccino	i wanna help lol
2016-05-16 16:10:42	na_th_an	make sure you tell her everything that she's doing wrong
2016-05-16 16:10:52	na_th_an	"oh you should really be using inversion of control to inject these dependencies"
2016-05-16 16:11:06	frappuccino	i dont even know what that means
2016-05-16 16:11:09	frappuccino	inversion of control?
2016-05-16 16:11:58	frappuccino	lol "that if statement is sort of hard to understand, you should use demorgans to make it more readable"
2016-05-16 16:11:59	na_th_an	Dependency Injection is Inversion of Control
2016-05-16 16:12:01	na_th_an	DI is IoC
2016-05-16 16:12:13	frappuccino	"de what" "emily if you understand that you are a shit coder"
2016-05-16 16:12:15	frappuccino	lol
2016-05-16 16:12:23	na_th_an	normally like, I'd write a class that asks for all of its dependencies
2016-05-16 16:12:34	na_th_an	inversion of control is inverting that
2016-05-16 16:12:39	na_th_an	and giving a class all of its dependencies
2016-05-16 16:12:41	na_th_an	like in spring
2016-05-16 16:12:45	frappuccino	oh okay
2016-05-16 16:12:58	na_th_an	where the dependencies are configured elsewhere (annotations, java config, xml)
2016-05-17 08:52:22	frappuccino	i was at emilys last night and i was like "okay i will lay down until 9:30 then drive home"
2016-05-17 08:52:32	frappuccino	then i woke up at 1am like FUCK
2016-05-17 08:52:34	na_th_an	lol
2016-05-17 08:52:39	frappuccino	and had to drive back from capital
2016-05-17 08:52:50	frappuccino	then didnt fall asleep till like 2:15am :(
2016-05-17 08:52:52	na_th_an	I like night drives like that
2016-05-17 08:52:56	na_th_an	but that sucks
2016-05-17 08:52:59	frappuccino	no the night drive was great
2016-05-17 08:53:09	frappuccino	just goin 74 the whole way no one in my way it was great
2016-05-17 12:56:45	frappuccino	silence falls in the irc chat
2016-05-17 12:56:49	frappuccino	ope
2016-05-17 16:27:02	frappuccino	what health plan did you do
2016-05-17 16:27:08	frappuccino	there's like EPO and PPO
2016-05-17 16:27:13	frappuccino	and then like a neither one
2016-05-17 16:27:15	frappuccino	idk what they are
2016-05-17 16:27:26	na_th_an	Exclusive Provider
2016-05-17 16:27:31	na_th_an	and Preferred Provider
2016-05-17 16:27:35	frappuccino	which did you do
2016-05-17 16:27:40	na_th_an	the cheaper one
2016-05-17 16:27:42	na_th_an	PPO I think
2016-05-17 16:27:49	na_th_an	maybe EPO
2016-05-17 16:27:51	na_th_an	idk
2016-05-17 16:28:06	na_th_an	ya EPO I think
2016-05-17 16:28:19	na_th_an	with the EPO plan you can go to any specialist in the organization without a referral
2016-05-17 16:28:23	na_th_an	and it's cheaper
2016-05-17 16:28:51	na_th_an	pretty sure steven is on the same one
2016-05-17 16:28:53	frappuccino	i just failed to demorgans something
2016-05-17 16:28:57	frappuccino	imma dummy
2016-05-17 16:29:05	na_th_an	.punch frappuccino
2016-05-17 16:29:09	frappuccino	i negated and kept the or because i suck
2016-05-18 04:44:52		irc: disconnected from server
2016-05-18 09:41:22	frappuccino	if (institutionFactory.getInstitution().getInstitutionType() == 'P')
2016-05-18 09:41:28	frappuccino	is P a constant somewhere

2016-05-19 15:34:54	frappuccino	clean run worked becauase that makes sense -_-
2016-05-19 15:34:55	frappuccino	maybe clean test

2016-05-19 15:35:17	na_th_an	idk
2016-05-19 15:35:17	frappuccino	is the test command using a different version of java lol like wtf
2016-05-19 15:36:06	na_th_an	it tries not to recompile things it doesn't need to
2016-05-19 15:36:23	frappuccino	it makes no sense because I changed the lines its complainging about
2016-05-19 15:36:33	frappuccino	like before that
2016-05-19 15:36:34	frappuccino	and it worked
2016-05-19 15:36:38	frappuccino	then i did test
2016-05-19 15:36:42	frappuccino	and it was like "oh doesn't compile"
2016-05-19 15:36:47	frappuccino	and im like i literally just compiled it
2016-05-19 15:36:59	frappuccino	okay I JUST did a clean run on the entire project and it is deploy and working
2016-05-19 15:37:29	na_th_an	something something schema chages?
2016-05-19 15:38:12	frappuccino	okay im trying to test again
2016-05-19 15:38:17	frappuccino	i double checked all of my java versions
2016-05-19 15:38:23	frappuccino	intelliJ isn't complaining about the line either
2016-05-19 15:38:30	frappuccino	and is using the same exact java version obviously
2016-05-19 15:39:05	frappuccino	W
2016-05-19 15:39:05	frappuccino	T
2016-05-19 15:39:06	frappuccino	F
2016-05-19 15:39:41	na_th_an	what happens if you "gw testCompile"
2016-05-19 15:39:55	frappuccino	on only that module?
2016-05-19 15:39:55	na_th_an	idk if that's even a thing
2016-05-19 15:40:01	na_th_an	you can do "gw tasks"
2016-05-19 15:40:08	na_th_an	see if there's a task for compiling test code
2016-05-19 15:40:11	na_th_an	if it's the test code that's failing
2016-05-19 15:40:25	frappuccino	its not test code
2016-05-19 15:40:59	na_th_an	idk man
2016-05-19 15:41:19	frappuccino	what does assemble do
2016-05-19 15:41:24	frappuccino	Assembles the outputs of this project.
2016-05-19 15:41:26	frappuccino	that means nothing to me
2016-05-19 15:41:37	na_th_an	it assembles it
2016-05-19 15:41:43	na_th_an	into like, a war or jar or whatever
2016-05-19 15:42:40	frappuccino	okay what the actual fuck
2016-05-19 15:42:45	frappuccino	i just did gw clean build
2016-05-19 15:42:49	frappuccino	oh jk
2016-05-19 15:42:51	frappuccino	i did assemble
2016-05-19 15:42:52	frappuccino	though
2016-05-19 15:42:54	frappuccino	and it worked
2016-05-19 15:43:05	na_th_an	*shrug*
2016-05-19 15:43:15	frappuccino	if it can assemble that means it can compile
2016-05-19 15:43:41	frappuccino	i literally just watched the task "discoveryui-controller:compileJava" pass
2016-05-19 15:43:52	frappuccino	which is the thing that wont compile when i do tests
2016-05-19 15:44:07	na_th_an	compileGroovy?
2016-05-19 15:44:24	frappuccino	its a java class

2016-05-20 12:56:06	frappuccino	because I made one call to the method
2016-05-20 12:56:45	na_th_an	is it because you set up a call expectation
2016-05-20 12:56:53	na_th_an	that those 27 methods aren't calling
2016-05-20 12:56:59	frappuccino	no
2016-05-20 12:57:03	frappuccino	its unexpected call to blah
2016-05-20 12:57:12	frappuccino	i get why they are all calling it

2016-05-23 13:40:37	na_th_an	the CI build does it all
2016-05-23 13:40:40	na_th_an	that's what CI is
2016-05-23 13:40:47	frappi	fancy
2016-05-23 13:40:48	na_th_an	CI == build, run tests, install
2016-05-23 13:41:03	na_th_an	if the tests or bulid fails then don't install
2016-05-23 13:41:03	frappi	well yeah but idk if it had to be automated to do all that
2016-05-23 13:41:11	na_th_an	it wouldn't be CI if it didn't
2016-05-23 13:41:29	frappi	i mean if i start it manually does it do the whole process
2016-05-23 13:41:30	frappi	it does
2016-05-23 13:41:34	frappi	that was the confuse
2016-05-23 13:41:41	na_th_an	yes it does
2016-05-23 13:41:47	frappi	god it takes 20 minutes on server
2016-05-23 13:41:48	frappi	nooo
2016-05-23 13:41:53	frappi	40 last time
2016-05-23 13:41:54	frappi	great
2016-05-23 13:41:55	frappi	now what
2016-05-23 13:42:00	na_th_an	22 minutes to build, deploy, activate everything
2016-05-23 13:42:13	na_th_an	wait until it builds and see which canned regression tests you broke
2016-05-23 13:42:19	frappi	:(
2016-05-23 13:42:32	frappi	does that happen a lot
2016-05-23 13:42:39	frappi	the time it took me to do this change is ridiculous
2016-05-23 13:42:48	frappi	like the overhead, after the bug was fixed
2016-05-23 13:42:53	na_th_an	yeah
2016-05-23 13:42:57	na_th_an	you'll get used to it
2016-05-23 13:42:59	na_th_an	and better at it
2016-05-23 13:43:31	frappi	ay commmit is in fisheye

2016-05-23 13:44:05	na_th_an	a
2016-05-23 13:46:43	frappi	uhhh time spent on this
2016-05-23 13:46:43	frappi	idk
2016-05-23 13:46:44	frappi	45
2016-05-23 13:48:43	frappi	love that 85h on there lol
2016-05-23 13:49:07	frappi	$2500 from just us on that ticket
2016-05-23 13:49:17	frappi	plus anyone who was in meetings about it or spent time on it lol
2016-05-23 14:30:10	frappi	what do i do about this
2016-05-23 14:31:34	frappi	http://buildap01exdu.dev.oclc.org:8810/build/3245323/spock_specification_report
2016-05-23 14:31:58	na_th_an	find the test case
2016-05-23 14:32:01	na_th_an	run through it manually
2016-05-23 14:32:05	na_th_an	see if it's a legit failure or not
2016-05-23 14:32:18	frappi	is this like a webdriver test or what
2016-05-23 14:32:23	na_th_an	and/or reproduce the failure locally and see what's happening
2016-05-23 14:32:31	na_th_an	yeah it uses firefox and webdriver
2016-05-23 14:32:37	na_th_an	with canned responses
2016-05-23 14:32:44	frappi	i do not have this setup
2016-05-23 14:32:44	na_th_an	it doesn't actually talk to a real services
2016-05-23 14:32:52	na_th_an	you don't need to set it up
2016-05-23 14:33:24	na_th_an	iirc it's pretty easy to run from intellij
2016-05-23 14:33:46	na_th_an	http://intranet-wiki.oclc.org/wiki/Zhangy/QuickNotes/DiscoveryUI#Spock_.28spock-canned-regression_module.29

2016-05-23 15:31:36	na_th_an	she prob would have freaked out
2016-05-23 15:31:45	na_th_an	are you laughing at your gf trying to code
2016-05-23 15:31:51	frappi	no lol
2016-05-23 15:31:53	frappi	i think its cute
2016-05-23 15:32:07	na_th_an	one of my friends has been talking about trying to learn to code
2016-05-23 15:32:08	frappi	"ugh i dont understand any of this coding thing now"
2016-05-23 15:32:16	na_th_an	lol
2016-05-23 15:32:21	na_th_an	same
2016-05-23 15:32:29	frappi	"they're trying to make me do it on my own now"
2016-05-23 15:32:43	frappi	"accidentally had a equal sign in there and it was screwing the whole thing up"
2016-05-23 15:32:48	frappi	i was like "yep that happens lol"\
2016-05-23 15:33:03	na_th_an	"try adding more ='s"

2016-05-23 15:33:34	na_th_an	I'm only half kidding
2016-05-23 15:33:36	na_th_an	bc javascript
2016-05-23 15:33:41	frappi	i dont think its javascript
2016-05-23 15:33:41	na_th_an	you could have =
2016-05-23 15:33:43	na_th_an	and want ===
2016-05-23 15:33:49	frappi	i think its still html css
2016-05-23 15:33:51	na_th_an	= everywhere
2016-05-23 15:34:02	frappi	i hate ====
2016-05-23 15:34:05	frappi	===*
2016-05-23 15:34:10	na_th_an	I hate !== more
2016-05-23 15:34:13	frappi	like just have is
2016-05-23 15:34:19	frappi	python if statement normally look great
2016-05-23 15:34:22	frappi	its cool when you can do
2016-05-23 15:34:25	frappi	if thing is not thing2:
2016-05-23 15:34:30	frappi	readable af
2016-05-23 15:34:36	na_th_an	yeah that is nice syntax
2016-05-23 15:34:47	na_th_an	doing a build
2016-05-23 15:34:49	na_th_an	I hope this passes
2016-05-23 15:34:52	na_th_an	and my shit still works
2016-05-23 15:34:56	na_th_an	then I can commit MegaDUI
2016-05-23 15:35:00	na_th_an	if I want to
2016-05-23 15:35:01	frappi	if object not in list:
2016-05-23 15:35:05	frappi	is also i thing you can do
2016-05-23 15:35:06	frappi	dope
2016-05-23 15:35:15	na_th_an	yeah 'in' is pretty cool too
2016-05-23 15:35:23	frappi	if char in string:
2016-05-23 15:35:27	na_th_an	I'm gonna be waiting awhile for Jinbin's stuff to be done
2016-05-23 15:35:30	frappi	i love python sometimes
2016-05-23 15:35:35	na_th_an	and that needs to be done before my stuf
2016-05-23 15:36:14	frappi	ohhh doing a geb spock thing is much harder than just spocok
2016-05-23 15:37:20	na_th_an	my mac charger is really hot
2016-05-23 15:37:22	frappi	so is it a priority to fix the canned regression test
2016-05-23 15:37:28	na_th_an	kinda
2016-05-23 15:37:29	frappi	na_th_an: yeah dont catch on fire
2016-05-23 15:37:31	na_th_an	those usually pass
2016-05-23 15:37:33	na_th_an	is it a legit failure?
2016-05-23 15:37:38	frappi	i think
2016-05-23 15:37:39	frappi	idk
2016-05-23 15:37:40	na_th_an	like have you tried to do in manually and it's broken
2016-05-23 15:37:54	na_th_an	bc if you broke it with your changes then it's a problem
2016-05-23 15:37:59	na_th_an	(you probably did)
2016-05-23 15:38:04	frappi	i think so
2016-05-23 15:38:38	frappi	this does not seem to be testing what it describes lol
2016-05-23 15:38:45	frappi	"test when the user selects a database, that database appears in the Collections facet"
2016-05-23 15:38:49	frappi	numberOfResults > 0
2016-05-23 15:38:51	frappi	what
2016-05-23 15:38:56	frappi	um
2016-05-23 15:39:06	frappi	guys i dont think thats correct
2016-05-23 15:40:14	na_th_an	*shrug*
2016-05-23 15:40:47	frappi	lets see if this run works...
2016-05-23 15:41:12	na_th_an	same
2016-05-23 15:41:28	frappi	this is fancy
2016-05-23 15:41:39	na_th_an	?
2016-05-23 15:41:47	frappi	running this from intelliJ
2016-05-23 15:41:56	frappi	it is sitting here not doing anything lol
2016-05-23 15:42:04	frappi	its stuck
2016-05-23 15:42:06	frappi	loading
2016-05-23 15:42:08	na_th_an	lol
2016-05-23 15:42:38	frappi	can it like... load
2016-05-23 15:42:41	frappi	wtf ci
2016-05-23 15:43:22	frappi	how long is it about to sit here not doing anything
2016-05-23 15:43:31	na_th_an	you might have to set the hostname
2016-05-23 15:43:38	na_th_an	01 and 02 are 'normal' ci servers
2016-05-23 15:43:43	na_th_an	and then 03 is our canned regression server
2016-05-23 15:43:45	na_th_an	iirc
2016-05-23 15:44:15	frappi	its using discoveryui.ent.oclc.org
2016-05-23 15:44:18	frappi	omg it just finished loading
2016-05-23 15:44:19	frappi	wtf
2016-05-23 15:44:22	frappi	it just worked eon local
2016-05-23 15:44:50	frappi	i think you were joking
2016-05-23 15:44:53	frappi	eric does not
2016-05-23 15:45:07	na_th_an	I did at one point
2016-05-23 15:45:13	frappi	ah
2016-05-23 15:45:16	frappi	then what
2016-05-23 15:45:17	na_th_an	and I did tell them I didn't want meds
2016-05-23 15:45:51	na_th_an	then I switched majors, started paying more attention to my mental health, did some psychedelics, and have enough will to keep myself alive every day
2016-05-23 15:46:10	frappi	sounds positive
2016-05-23 15:46:35	na_th_an	yeah it's going alright
2016-05-23 15:46:49	frappi	discoveryui.ent.oclc.org
2016-05-23 15:46:50	frappi	that is ci right
2016-05-23 15:47:06	na_th_an	that's the load balancer
2016-05-23 15:47:14	frappi	okay
2016-05-23 15:48:08	frappi	so if it passed on local now what
2016-05-23 15:48:11	frappi	run it again on qb?
2016-05-23 15:48:32	frappi	eric wtf
2016-05-23 15:48:39	na_th_an	I mean
2016-05-23 15:48:45	na_th_an	going part time is better than failing classes
2016-05-23 15:48:48	frappi	i guess
2016-05-23 15:48:58	frappi	a good question though is why cant he deal with the busy semesters
2016-05-23 15:48:59	frappi	we all did
2016-05-23 15:49:00	frappi	we are fine
2016-05-23 15:49:54	na_th_an	well the worrying thing
2016-05-23 15:50:01	na_th_an	if he can'd deal with school and a busy semester
2016-05-23 15:50:09	na_th_an	can he deal with work?
2016-05-23 15:50:15	frappi	idk man
2016-05-23 15:50:26	na_th_an	half of school is supposed to just show that you're dedicated enough and will work hard for a long term goal
2016-05-23 15:50:27	frappi	work has already enveloped me lol
2016-05-23 15:50:30	na_th_an	and he uhh

2016-05-24 15:14:46	na_th_an	do you know about tail call recursion
2016-05-24 15:14:50	frappi	yes
2016-05-24 15:15:16	na_th_an	he's taking about a compiler that would take a recursive function you wrote
2016-05-24 15:15:31	na_th_an	and turn it into a tail call recursive function (which I don't think compilers can do automatically)
2016-05-24 15:15:40	na_th_an	then optimize that tail call into a loop
2016-05-24 15:15:43	na_th_an	then unroll the loop
2016-05-24 15:15:50	na_th_an	but it's still processing the data structure backwards? idk
2016-05-24 15:15:54	frappi	unrolling
2016-05-24 15:15:59	frappi	does that just mean like

2016-05-26 10:42:31	frappi	-_-
2016-05-26 10:43:02	frappi	i am oddly forgiving for still using java 7 in disco
2016-05-26 10:43:12	frappi	like in a lack of resources way
2016-05-26 10:43:30	na_th_an	since we're using groovy we don't need it THAT badly
2016-05-26 10:43:38	frappi	also that
2016-05-26 10:43:53	frappi	but also migrating everything to java 8 would probably cause issues and everything is working so
2016-05-26 10:44:00	frappi	everything is *sort of* working so
2016-05-26 10:49:38	na_th_an	how long did eric complain about GPM
2016-05-26 10:49:51	frappi	what is GPM
2016-05-26 10:49:53	na_th_an	and how long would it take to give the name of a fucked up artist that always pisses him off

2016-05-27 09:57:37	na_th_an	I do definitely picture them getting drunk at happy hour, leaving the bar together to go home, and then having drunk sex together
2016-05-27 09:57:52	na_th_an	we'd have to have happy hour closer to their houses so that abby won't drive
2016-05-27 09:57:53	frappi	like a thing thats already happened? lol

2016-05-27 13:56:53	na_th_an	I think the thing that makes me annoyed with him
2016-05-27 13:56:58	frappi	lol
2016-05-27 13:57:01	na_th_an	is that he doesn't take responsibility for his actions

2016-05-27 13:57:07	na_th_an	like, him failing classes and he just doesn't give a shit

2016-05-27 13:57:12	na_th_an	"oh that happened to me"
2016-05-27 13:57:18	na_th_an	like there was nothing he could have done to stop it
2016-05-27 13:57:30	na_th_an	it's just a thing that happened, like rain or an exit ramp being closed
2016-05-27 13:57:35	na_th_an	not his fault at all
2016-05-27 13:57:51	na_th_an	he's never like "yeah I fucked up, I should really try harder"
2016-05-27 13:58:06	na_th_an	"man I've gotten in after 9:30 every day this week and left before 5. I should work harder."
2016-05-27 13:58:12	na_th_an	these just aren't things he thinks

2016-05-31 12:34:21	frappi	me and my dad made up this game 5 years ago where you stanad 20 feet apart and throw the frisbee as hard as you can
2016-05-31 12:34:45	frappi	and the other person has to catch it
2016-05-31 12:34:52	na_th_an	oh lol
2016-05-31 12:34:53	frappi	if you drop it the other person gets a point
2016-05-31 12:35:02	na_th_an	what if it's a shitty throw
2016-05-31 12:35:03	frappi	if its out of range (like a ball in baseball) you get a point
2016-05-31 12:35:10	na_th_an	oh
2016-05-31 12:35:18	frappi	if its out of range and you go for it but don tget they gget a point
2016-05-31 12:35:22	frappi	its like baseball hitting rules
2016-05-31 12:35:29	frappi	catching does nothing, just keep the game going
2016-05-31 12:35:31	frappi	its really fun
2016-05-31 12:35:34	frappi	and kind of scary
2016-05-31 12:40:02	na_th_an	I got my first complements on my car
2016-05-31 12:40:09	frappi	ayy
2016-05-31 12:40:22	na_th_an	dude's like "ya I had one of those. I put like 1200 into the engine and lowered it so it was 2 inches off the ground"
2016-05-31 12:40:36	na_th_an	"it had over 400hp, I'd do 90mph off the on ramp
2016-05-31 12:41:29	frappi	uhu
2016-05-31 12:41:36	frappi	im sure your honda civic had 400hp
2016-05-31 12:41:39	frappi	:P
2016-05-31 12:41:54	frappi	and I can doo 90mph off an on ramp too with 178 horsepower so
2016-05-31 12:41:57	na_th_an	it's possible, but I doubt you doubled the stock hp with $1200
2016-05-31 12:42:07	frappi	but i don't because I'm not a fuck
2016-05-31 12:42:10	frappi	yeah
2016-05-31 12:42:16	na_th_an	yeah I just do like 75mph :)
2016-05-31 12:42:16	frappi	im sure you could
2016-05-31 12:42:18	frappi	but im sure he didn
2016-05-31 12:42:21	na_th_an	yeah
2016-05-31 12:42:26	frappi	yeah i come on the freeway at like 74 if i can
2016-05-31 12:42:28	na_th_an	he was telling me about he coils he put on
2016-05-31 12:42:41	frappi	but yeah if i floored it i could be at 100 by the time I got on probably
2016-05-31 12:42:54	frappi	and also thats a torque
2016-05-31 12:42:57	frappi	thing
2016-05-31 12:43:03	frappi	horsepower != torque
2016-05-31 12:43:20	na_th_an	well your transmission should maximize your torque
2016-05-31 12:43:38	frappi	yeah more horsepower probably means more torque but its not a direct correlation
2016-05-31 12:43:48	frappi	anyway that guy is full of shit
2016-05-31 12:44:06	frappi	if you want 400 horsepower and to drive on the freeway at 90mph get a mustang gt
2016-05-31 12:44:12	na_th_an	lol yeah
2016-05-31 12:44:22	frappi	thats the most feasible way to get > 400 hp
2016-05-31 12:44:26	na_th_an	yeah
2016-05-31 12:44:33	na_th_an	if all you want is a cheap fast drive

2016-06-01 09:02:51	frappi	this method is confusing
2016-06-01 09:03:14	na_th_an	no it isn't
2016-06-01 09:03:55	na_th_an	what method
2016-06-01 09:03:59	na_th_an	are you going to continue there
2016-06-01 09:04:00	frappi	isActive
2016-06-01 09:04:02	na_th_an	or not
2016-06-01 09:04:04	na_th_an	oh
2016-06-01 09:04:06	na_th_an	no it isn't
2016-06-01 09:04:09	na_th_an	?
2016-06-01 09:04:11	frappi	when will it ever return false
2016-06-01 09:04:17	na_th_an	never
2016-06-01 09:04:20	frappi	wtf
2016-06-01 09:04:26	na_th_an	but with togglz
2016-06-01 09:04:29	frappi	why is it called isActive
2016-06-01 09:04:30	na_th_an	if you set the feature to 'false'
2016-06-01 09:04:35	na_th_an	in the featuers file
2016-06-01 09:04:47	na_th_an	when you call isActive on teh feature manager
2016-06-01 09:04:49	na_th_an	it'll say false
2016-06-01 09:04:55	na_th_an	if it's active in the feature file
2016-06-01 09:05:00	na_th_an	then it calls this method
2016-06-01 09:05:28	na_th_an	if it's active in the feature file then the feature is active and I put the parameter on the feature state
2016-06-01 09:05:46	frappi	is the method checking to see if something is active?
2016-06-01 09:05:52	frappi	because thats what it seems like its doing by the name
2016-06-01 09:06:10	na_th_an	it's an implementation for togglz
2016-06-01 09:06:15	na_th_an	it's how togglz works

2016-06-01 12:46:49	na_th_an	and thought about how that used to be standard
2016-06-01 12:46:54	na_th_an	I used to have dual CRT monitors
2016-06-01 12:47:06	na_th_an	it's crazy how far things have come
2016-06-01 12:48:19	frappi	no lol
2016-06-01 13:01:08	frappi	so like
2016-06-01 13:01:19	frappi	developing a web app couldn't happen without developers right
2016-06-01 13:01:26	frappi	people who can write software like you and me
2016-06-01 13:01:38	na_th_an	sure
2016-06-01 13:02:06	frappi	and we need time to develop our shit, we dont wanna test
2016-06-01 13:02:15	frappi	if we spend tons of time testing, we wont be developing
2016-06-01 13:02:17	frappi	so we need qa
2016-06-01 13:02:24	na_th_an	yes
2016-06-01 13:03:01	frappi	but im assuming you and I are both smart enough and thoughtful enough to design a not shitty UI that doesn't look like shit and is usable
2016-06-01 13:03:17	frappi	so like wtf does ux do
2016-06-01 13:03:31	frappi	like i understand what they do
2016-06-01 13:03:33	frappi	but
2016-06-01 13:03:33	na_th_an	they seriously don't do a lot
2016-06-01 13:03:35	na_th_an	like
2016-06-01 13:03:50	na_th_an	if I were a manager i'd be kinda resentful toward binaebi
2016-06-01 13:03:55	na_th_an	because she probably gets paid the same as like, bill
2016-06-01 13:04:03	na_th_an	but she doesn't have to deal with nearly the same shit bill does
2016-06-01 13:04:11	frappi	i mean i understand having product people
2016-06-01 13:04:22	na_th_an	the kind of emergencies that UX has are much less serious than actual production emergencies
2016-06-01 13:04:41	frappi	because someone needs to be able to understand the market and understand what our memebrs want and stuff
2016-06-01 13:04:49	frappi	and understand what the product needs to be to make money blah blah blah
2016-06-01 13:04:54	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-01 13:04:57	frappi	i dont want to and probably can't successfully do that shit
2016-06-01 13:05:00	na_th_an	they do a lot of market problem analysis kinda stuff
2016-06-01 13:05:07	frappi	but I can design a good looking and usable UI
2016-06-01 13:05:13	frappi	with thoughtful messages
2016-06-01 13:05:15	frappi	that make sense
2016-06-01 13:05:32	frappi	like, maybe UX was neccessary 20 years ago
2016-06-01 13:05:45	na_th_an	yeah but like
2016-06-01 13:05:51	frappi	because without good HTML5 frameworks, no way in hell I could design a good looking and usable UI
2016-06-01 13:05:53	frappi	but now
2016-06-01 13:05:53	na_th_an	someone has to 'own' that
2016-06-01 13:06:02	na_th_an	'own' the look of the UI
2016-06-01 13:06:10	na_th_an	and approve it
2016-06-01 13:06:22	na_th_an	like, some of the things that devs make are really shitty
2016-06-01 13:06:27	frappi	what if we had front end devs
2016-06-01 13:06:28	frappi	who did that
2016-06-01 13:06:39	na_th_an	that's a ridiculous thought
2016-06-01 13:06:43	frappi	more artistically creative devs who are good at javascript
2016-06-01 13:06:45	na_th_an	because then we'd have to have developers with skills
2016-06-01 13:06:50	frappi	lol
2016-06-01 13:06:53	frappi	rockstars
2016-06-01 13:06:58	na_th_an	was just gonna say that lol
2016-06-01 13:07:03	na_th_an	we need some front end rockstars
2016-06-01 13:07:28	frappi	how much money does oclc waste on unnecessary positions i wonder
2016-06-01 13:07:39	frappi	not as much since last year lol
2016-06-01 13:08:55	frappi	i just received a giant packet from wanda belcher
2016-06-01 13:09:46	frappi	OH THATS THE STRAIGHT DOPE!
2016-06-01 13:10:06	frappi	"congrats on your two year anniversary with OCLC, here's your better retirement plan" nice
2016-06-01 13:10:06	frappi	lol
2016-06-01 14:30:06	frappuccino	so like
2016-06-01 14:30:22	frappuccino	im glad that the people choosing to do shootings are so bad at it that they only killed 2 people so far
2016-06-01 14:30:43	frappuccino	as far as we know at least
2016-06-01 14:30:46	na_th_an	yeah it is kinda amazing how low some of the death tolls are in things like this
2016-06-01 14:30:55	frappuccino	like what actually happened
2016-06-01 14:30:57	na_th_an	idk
2016-06-01 14:31:05	na_th_an	and everything you read about it right now is probably false
2016-06-01 14:31:06	frappuccino	because they weren't going for most kills
2016-06-01 14:31:24	frappuccino	they *could* have walked into a crowd of people and spun around shooting
2016-06-01 14:31:26	na_th_an	if there's one thing I've learned on reddit it's that media reporting is shit
2016-06-01 14:31:34	na_th_an	especially in situtiations like this
2016-06-01 14:31:56	frappuccino	yeah
2016-06-01 14:32:12	na_th_an	I can't wait for the conspiracy theories
2016-06-01 14:32:18	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-01 14:32:23	frappuccino	"it never really happened"
2016-06-01 14:32:25	frappuccino	sandy hook
2016-06-01 14:32:26	frappuccino	wtf
2016-06-01 14:32:34	frappuccino	like why are there conspiracies about that
2016-06-01 14:34:13	na_th_an	because human psychology
2016-06-01 14:34:19	na_th_an	I could talk about it for awhile
2016-06-01 14:34:36	frappuccino	i hate flat earthers
2016-06-01 14:34:42	frappuccino	i hate 9/11 conspiratards
2016-06-01 14:34:46	frappuccino	moon landing shit

2016-06-01 14:34:53	na_th_an	it's pretty ridiculous
2016-06-01 14:34:54	frappuccino	about
2016-06-01 14:34:54	frappuccino	it
2016-06-01 14:35:00	na_th_an	then there's things like contrails
2016-06-01 14:35:04	na_th_an	and homepathic medicine
2016-06-01 14:35:06	frappuccino	omg
2016-06-01 14:35:12	na_th_an	I know people that believe in that shit

2016-06-01 14:56:43	frappuccino	like last summer
2016-06-01 14:59:42	na_th_an	yeah

2016-06-01 15:00:28	frappuccino	i remember him saying pedantic a lot
2016-06-01 15:30:48	frappuccino	i walked around at capital yesterday because me and emily went on a walk from her house and it was weird
2016-06-01 15:31:00	frappuccino	i was like 'i will never be in any of these buildings again'
2016-06-01 15:31:01	frappuccino	kinda sad
2016-06-01 15:31:09	na_th_an	I hated school
2016-06-01 15:31:19	na_th_an	I have had no nostalgia towards OSU really

2016-06-08 15:50:18	na_th_an	which is maybe kinda valid
2016-06-08 15:50:19	beefnprokboi	lol
2016-06-08 15:50:29	na_th_an	but he probably doesn't know about MTP
2016-06-08 15:50:33	beefnprokboi	except you know if he did he just read it somewhere
2016-06-08 15:50:43	beefnprokboi	i will proudly say I know nothing about MTP lol
2016-06-08 15:51:10	na_th_an	it's basically why you can't mount your phone's SD card on your computer when you plug it in anymore
2016-06-08 15:51:21	na_th_an	before you'd unmount it from your phone and mount it on your PC
2016-06-08 15:51:27	na_th_an	since it can't be mounted in both places
2016-06-08 15:51:33	na_th_an	MTP is a media transfer protocol
2016-06-08 15:51:46	na_th_an	for transferring media between the phone and PC without havaing to unmount it from the phone
2016-06-08 15:51:51	na_th_an	so both systems can access it at the same time
2016-06-08 15:51:53	na_th_an	it works... pretty well
2016-06-08 15:51:57	na_th_an	when it works
2016-06-08 15:52:01	na_th_an	which isn't that often on Linux
2016-06-08 15:52:11	na_th_an	although tbh it's been a along time since I've tried
2016-06-08 15:52:25	beefnprokboi	im about to ask jeff to erase the logs
2016-06-08 15:52:31	beefnprokboi	wrong chat oops
2016-06-08 16:48:35	frappi	ugh
2016-06-08 16:48:41	na_th_an	:(
2016-06-08 16:50:59	frappi	even after we said groovy he was like
2016-06-08 16:51:10	frappi	"bit shift left" yeah i fucking know eric lo.
2016-06-08 16:51:16	na_th_an	yeah and then I'm like
2016-06-08 16:51:19	na_th_an	"well it can be a lot of things"
2016-06-08 16:51:21	na_th_an	so he's like
2016-06-08 16:51:25	na_th_an	"then why did he ask?"
2016-06-08 16:51:28	na_th_an	uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
2016-06-08 16:51:37	frappi	because IT CAN BE A LOT OF THINGS
2016-06-09 09:27:36	frappi	everyones here except eric lol
2016-06-09 11:26:54	frappi	view-source:http://firefly-readonly.prod.oclc.org/firefly-service/rs/sru/registrydiscoverylists?operation=searchRetrieve&version=1.1&x-info-5-serviceName=FireflySRUPage&recordPacking=xml&query=local.type+%3D+%22coursereserves%22&maximumRecords=1&startRecord=1
2016-06-09 11:27:06	frappi	easiest way to parse the 14694 out of num records?
2016-06-09 11:27:08	frappi	in groovy
2016-06-09 11:29:38	na_th_an	parse the what now?
2016-06-09 11:29:58	na_th_an	you want the number of records?
2016-06-09 11:30:04	frappi	yeah
2016-06-09 11:30:10	na_th_an	well since this is a one off script
2016-06-09 11:30:17	frappi	XmlSlurper
2016-06-09 11:30:18	na_th_an	I'd pobably use regex
2016-06-09 11:30:18	frappi	is what i found
2016-06-09 11:30:24	frappi	http://groovy-lang.org/processing-xml.html
2016-06-09 11:30:27	frappi	cool af
2016-06-09 11:30:28	na_th_an	I'd regex that bitch personally
2016-06-09 11:32:43	frappi	dude that is insane
2016-06-09 11:32:49	frappi	URL initRequest = new URL(BASE_URL + "&${MAX_REC_PARAM}=1&${START_REC_PARAM}=${startRecord}")
2016-06-09 11:32:49	frappi	String result = initRequest.getText()
2016-06-09 11:32:49	frappi	def parsed = new XmlSlurper().parseText(result)
2016-06-09 11:32:49	frappi	int numRecords = parsed.numberOfRecords.toInteger()
2016-06-09 11:32:54	frappi	groovy is officially the shit
2016-06-09 11:33:06	na_th_an	oh wow
2016-06-09 11:33:08	frappi	that worked
2016-06-09 11:33:10	na_th_an	in java that'd be...
2016-06-09 11:33:13	na_th_an	shit
2016-06-09 11:33:16	frappi	insane
2016-06-09 11:33:28	frappi	im in awe
2016-06-09 16:08:28	na_th_an	I can't believe abby pulled the 8 hours card on jeff
2016-06-09 16:08:30	na_th_an	like
2016-06-09 16:08:33	na_th_an	wow
2016-06-09 16:08:50	na_th_an	that's why I tried to tell her that lunch doesn't count, so she wouldn't say something like that
2016-06-09 16:09:17	frappi	lol
2016-06-09 16:09:25	frappi	"i got here at 8:30" like thats early

2016-06-09 16:10:07	frappi	but he stays way after me I think
2016-06-09 16:10:19	na_th_an	jinbin gets here early

2016-06-13 10:00:15	na_th_an	I haven't heard of stephen or abby having a date as long as I've known them
2016-06-13 10:00:34	frappuccino	i feel like some people just tell themselves that so they dont get rejected or something
2016-06-13 10:00:40	frappuccino	'cant get hurt if you dont try'
2016-06-13 10:00:52	na_th_an	yeah I guess

2016-06-13 11:16:28	na_th_an	more likely: eric isn't telling the full truth

2016-06-13 11:20:34	na_th_an	I felt bad for him
2016-06-13 11:20:41	na_th_an	until I was in classes with him

2016-06-13 11:21:12	na_th_an	and not only did he not take that help, he refuses to even admit to himself that he needs help
2016-06-13 11:21:45	na_th_an	as far as I can tell he's just totally okay with the situation he's in
2016-06-13 12:37:06	na_th_an	"not tired today"

2016-06-13 13:52:10	na_th_an	so don't use mock()
2016-06-13 13:52:24	na_th_an	@Mock
2016-06-13 13:52:26	na_th_an	iirc
2016-06-13 13:52:31	na_th_an	mockito is different
2016-06-13 13:52:33	frappuccino	mock is a mockito thing too
2016-06-13 13:52:39	frappuccino	i know
2016-06-13 13:52:41	na_th_an	I've never seen it used
2016-06-13 13:53:04	frappuccino	its used here other placces
2016-06-13 13:53:11	na_th_an	idk
2016-06-13 13:53:15	frappuccino	either way it didnt work with the @Mock annotation
2016-06-13 13:53:16	na_th_an	it seems like your mock isn't being played
2016-06-13 13:53:23	na_th_an	are you missing a class annotation?
2016-06-13 13:53:30	frappuccino	no? idts?
2016-06-13 13:53:42	na_th_an	idts?
2016-06-13 13:53:44	na_th_an	oh
2016-06-13 13:53:46	na_th_an	i remember now
2016-06-13 13:54:30	na_th_an	you have the right imports right?
2016-06-13 13:54:34	frappuccino	yah
2016-06-13 13:54:37	frappuccino	im making changes
2016-06-13 13:54:39	frappuccino	not writing my own class
2016-06-13 13:54:39	na_th_an	you aren't accidentially importing a gmock thing?
2016-06-13 13:54:43	frappuccino	no
2016-06-13 13:54:50	frappuccino	i searched the entire class for gmock jeez
2016-06-13 13:54:55	frappuccino	stop thinking there is gmock here lol
2016-06-13 13:55:03	na_th_an	what class is this
2016-06-13 13:55:09	frappuccino	BibServiceESL
2016-06-13 13:55:16	frappuccino	there isn't a conversion service mock in it yet
2016-06-13 13:55:17	frappuccino	Test
2016-06-13 13:55:18	frappuccino	btw
2016-06-13 13:55:20	frappuccino	^^^
2016-06-13 13:55:57	na_th_an	are your matchers not getting hit?
2016-06-13 13:56:04	na_th_an	does it return not null if you match anything
2016-06-13 13:56:33	frappuccino	hold on
2016-06-13 13:57:02	frappuccino	found it
2016-06-13 13:57:12	frappuccino	some of the methods use a different instance of owcCustomQuery
2016-06-13 13:57:18	frappuccino	so there's not match for that method call
2016-06-13 14:03:03	frappuccino	you think abby knows that
2016-06-13 14:04:14	na_th_an	idk
2016-06-13 14:04:17	na_th_an	maybe
2016-06-13 14:52:32	na_th_an	plz don't be a new bug
2016-06-13 14:52:39	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-13 14:55:14	frappuccino	idk what jeff is trying to say
2016-06-13 14:55:35	na_th_an	that the thing was fucked up before thursday
2016-06-13 14:55:41	na_th_an	it isn't a new bug
2016-06-13 14:59:26	frappuccino	unless my parsing is like HUGELY wrong i dont get why this would happen
2016-06-13 14:59:45	na_th_an	is it possible
2016-06-13 14:59:53	na_th_an	that it happened because firefly gave you back shit/incomplete/wrong data?
2016-06-13 15:00:08	na_th_an	because that's my guess
2016-06-13 15:00:21	frappuccino	i guess so
2016-06-13 15:00:37	frappuccino	its pretty possible that there is a bug in my parsing
2016-06-13 15:00:54	na_th_an	i'd argue thata it's more likely that firefly sucks
2016-06-13 15:01:03	na_th_an	especially since you re-ran your script and it found it
2016-06-13 15:01:11	frappuccino	true
2016-06-13 15:01:22	frappuccino	i ran it twice thursday once we cleaned up and it found nothing tiwce
2016-06-13 15:01:24	frappuccino	twice*
2016-06-13 15:01:41	na_th_an	yeah because that afternoon firefly felt like returning some data
2016-06-13 15:01:45	na_th_an	and it did consistently
2016-06-13 15:01:48	na_th_an	that afternoon
2016-06-13 15:01:53	na_th_an	and now it's different because it's monday
2016-06-13 15:01:55	na_th_an	seems reasonable to me
2016-06-13 15:02:00	na_th_an	given what I know about firefly/find
2016-06-13 15:02:16	na_th_an	"oh a cloud just flew over. let's see if the results changed"
2016-06-13 15:02:34	na_th_an	"I think Kim Jong Un just finished a meal. Let's see if Perf is up"
2016-06-13 15:02:56	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-13 15:03:54	frappuccino	i think i found a bug in my script
2016-06-13 15:04:29	na_th_an	don't tell anyone
2016-06-13 15:04:31	frappuccino	where if the very last record in the entire set is bad (each set is 1000) then it wont be found
2016-06-13 15:04:32	na_th_an	blame find
2016-06-13 15:04:43	na_th_an	two hard things in coding
2016-06-13 15:04:44	na_th_an	off by one
2016-06-13 15:05:23	frappuccino	fixed and rerunning... same results
2016-06-13 15:05:40	na_th_an	change it to sets of 999
2016-06-13 15:06:04	frappuccino	thats an argument so that was super easy to do because i am best code man
2016-06-13 15:06:22	na_th_an	I have no fucking idea how to use kibana
2016-06-13 15:06:28	na_th_an	"make a dashboard"
2016-06-13 15:06:31	na_th_an	fuck
2016-06-13 15:06:57	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-13 15:07:17	frappuccino	2 corrupted courses
2016-06-13 15:07:24	frappuccino	im betting that it can happen to modified courses
2016-06-13 15:07:31	na_th_an	huh
2016-06-13 15:07:34	frappuccino	both of these courses were modified over the weekend
2016-06-13 15:07:34	na_th_an	what do you mean
2016-06-13 15:07:37	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-13 15:07:38	frappuccino	but created before the fix
2016-06-13 15:07:41	na_th_an	that's why they found them
2016-06-13 15:07:48	frappuccino	true
2016-06-13 15:07:53	na_th_an	they found the error because they tried to modify them over the weekend
2016-06-13 15:08:01	na_th_an	and THANK GOD they were created before the fix
2016-06-13 15:08:04	frappuccino	i swear this script would have found them lol
2016-06-13 15:08:21	na_th_an	blame firefly
2016-06-13 15:08:45	frappuccino	ope second one dateModified "2016-05-30T16:35:29.769"
2016-06-13 15:08:47	frappuccino	thats not good
2016-06-13 15:08:54	frappuccino	... that just has to be firefly
2016-06-13 15:08:56	na_th_an	no that's fine
2016-06-13 15:08:58	frappuccino	how would i have no found that
2016-06-13 15:09:05	frappuccino	no it should have been fixed on thursday
2016-06-13 15:09:08	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-13 15:09:11	frappuccino	when i ran this "find all the bad shit script"
2016-06-13 15:09:14	na_th_an	all of them should have
2016-06-13 15:09:19	na_th_an	assuming your script and firefly worked
2016-06-13 15:09:39	na_th_an	it's not indicative of more course reserves being corrupted though
2016-06-13 15:12:23	frappuccino	they only found one
2016-06-13 15:12:28	frappuccino	how the fuck did i not find that one
2016-06-13 15:12:39	frappuccino	does firefly give back stuff in the same order everytime
2016-06-13 15:12:47	frappuccino	i could have tried the 999 thign
2016-06-13 15:12:50	frappuccino	i also fixed the bug though
2016-06-13 15:13:16	frappuccino	it makes sense that I would have found it today if there was a new course reserve and it pushed one at the end of a page back

2016-06-13 15:56:05	frappuccino	because the answer is so easy
2016-06-13 15:56:09	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-13 15:56:11	na_th_an	so why the fuck are you asking me
2016-06-13 15:56:39	na_th_an	I just
2016-06-13 15:56:43	na_th_an	I don't know what to do about this
2016-06-13 15:56:57	frappuccino	what lol
2016-06-13 15:57:01	frappuccino	what do you mean lololol
2016-06-13 15:57:17	na_th_an	idk like
2016-06-13 15:57:22	na_th_an	can we still make eye contact
2016-06-13 15:57:25	frappuccino	lolol
2016-06-13 15:59:05	frappuccino	...
2016-06-13 15:59:22	na_th_an	?
2016-06-13 15:59:27	frappuccino	idk
2016-06-13 16:00:10	frappuccino	good talk
2016-06-13 16:10:47	frappuccino	i fixed the off by one thing thursday and ran it again and got no new ones
2016-06-13 16:10:51	frappuccino	not off by one but yeah
2016-06-13 16:10:58	frappuccino	misses the last one in the set
2016-06-13 16:11:15	na_th_an	well that's an off by one error
2016-06-13 16:11:23	frappuccino	so
2016-06-13 16:11:37	frappuccino	between each record in teh respond there is </record><record>
2016-06-13 16:11:59	frappuccino	so everytime I saw <record> i was like "okay end that record and start processing the next"
2016-06-13 16:12:03	frappuccino	but for the last one
2016-06-13 16:12:05	frappuccino	there is no <record>
2016-06-13 16:12:13	frappuccino	to end it.. because there's nothing after it
2016-06-13 16:12:15	frappuccino	so i just changed it to
2016-06-13 16:12:19	na_th_an	do you mean </record>
2016-06-13 16:12:27	frappuccino	no
2016-06-13 16:12:40	frappuccino	because it has to start processing the first record on the first one
2016-06-13 16:12:41	na_th_an	oh
2016-06-13 16:12:44	na_th_an	I see what you mean
2016-06-13 16:12:50	frappuccino	the </record><record> are always on the same line next to each other
2016-06-13 16:12:53	frappuccino	it processes by line
2016-06-13 16:13:05	frappuccino	so i had to just do this
2016-06-13 16:13:05	frappuccino	if (it.contains(RECORD_TAG) || it.contains(END_RECORD_TAG))
2016-06-13 16:13:39	na_th_an	are you arguing that it was not an off by one error because of this?
2016-06-13 16:13:42	na_th_an	or what
2016-06-13 16:13:56	na_th_an	I'd call that an off by one error
2016-06-13 16:14:16	frappuccino	off by one is generally liek an index thing
2016-06-13 16:14:25	frappuccino	i guess that could be called an off by one error
2016-06-13 16:14:42	na_th_an	yeah it's not like
2016-06-13 16:14:44	na_th_an	you forgot a -1
2016-06-13 16:14:58	na_th_an	but I'd still call that an off by one
2016-06-13 16:14:58	frappuccino	thats what off one is to me
2016-06-13 16:15:37	na_th_an	any time you forget to check the edge case when processing a bunch of records and miss the first/last one is an off by one imo
2016-06-13 16:16:00	frappuccino	that makes sense
2016-06-13 16:16:30	na_th_an	they just USUALLY manifest as fucking up 0 based indexes or something like that
2016-06-14 08:41:09	frappuccino	like smoke weed 8 hours a day 7 days a week lol :P
2016-06-14 08:41:19	na_th_an	lol
2016-06-14 08:41:27	na_th_an	hey now it's not 8 hours a day
2016-06-14 08:42:03	frappuccino	6
2016-06-14 08:42:08	frappuccino	6-12
2016-06-14 08:42:09	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-14 08:42:19	na_th_an	I've been smoking less than I used to
2016-06-14 08:42:21	na_th_an	and not even smoking
2016-06-14 08:42:46	frappuccino	oil rigging whatever that is
2016-06-14 08:42:50	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-14 08:42:56	na_th_an	it's the same as vaping
2016-06-14 08:43:03	frappuccino	except THC out the max
2016-06-14 08:43:06	na_th_an	there's not a ton of smoke shit that you're inhaling
2016-06-14 08:43:09	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-14 08:43:23	na_th_an	but that's not really harmful
2016-06-14 09:39:59	frappuccino	im going to caf im assuming youre good

2016-06-14 10:24:29	frappuccino	like pnc or discover or facebook or google lol
2016-06-14 10:24:52	na_th_an	and you use parts of the URL
2016-06-14 10:24:56	na_th_an	to mutate your password
2016-06-14 10:24:58	na_th_an	based on the website?
2016-06-14 10:25:36	frappuccino	yes i guess so lol

2016-06-14 11:56:44	frappuccino	how long till this install is over
2016-06-14 11:56:55	na_th_an	way after lunch
2016-06-14 11:56:58	na_th_an	we're finishing group 2
2016-06-14 11:57:01	na_th_an	then they have to do group 3
2016-06-14 11:57:04	na_th_an	which involves installing dui
2016-06-14 11:57:06	na_th_an	rolling back dui
2016-06-14 11:57:09	na_th_an	then installing it again
2016-06-14 11:57:15	frappuccino	:(
2016-06-14 11:57:17	na_th_an	and verifying it on the install and the rollback
2016-06-14 11:57:21	frappuccino	boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
2016-06-14 11:57:24	na_th_an	yup
2016-06-14 11:57:28	frappuccino	are you eating at your desk
2016-06-14 11:57:33	na_th_an	yeah I think I am
2016-06-14 11:57:38	frappuccino	im too tired for this shit
2016-06-14 11:57:43	na_th_an	hopefully mark will be done with his cheps
2016-06-14 11:57:46	na_th_an	chips

2016-06-14 12:24:32	frappuccino	oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit
2016-06-14 12:24:44	na_th_an	did you poop yourself?
2016-06-14 12:24:56	frappuccino	the largest size you can do in firefly is 500
2016-06-14 12:25:00	frappuccino	i was doing 100
2016-06-14 12:25:01	na_th_an	lololol
2016-06-14 12:25:02	frappuccino	1000*
2016-06-14 12:25:11	frappuccino	i was missing every other 500 records
2016-06-14 12:25:18	na_th_an	nice
2016-06-14 12:25:20	frappuccino	running with 500 now
2016-06-14 12:25:38	na_th_an	nbd
2016-06-14 12:25:45	frappuccino	only found 4
2016-06-14 12:32:40	frappuccino	all fixed
2016-06-14 12:35:03	na_th_an	how many did you find
2016-06-14 12:35:06	frappuccino	4
2016-06-14 12:35:20	na_th_an	word
2016-06-14 12:39:13	frappuccino	still dont know how i found more without changing anything
2016-06-14 12:39:35	na_th_an	new course reserves were created so you got a different set of 500
2016-06-14 12:39:53	frappuccino	maybe
2016-06-14 12:40:15	frappuccino	im curious about how theres only 4 that i just found that
2016-06-14 12:40:20	frappuccino	when there were 20 in the other set of 500
2016-06-14 13:22:35	frappuccino	what was dat
2016-06-14 13:22:47	na_th_an	what
2016-06-14 13:54:48	frappuccino	na_th_an: i have not done much today....
2016-06-14 13:57:10	na_th_an	me either
2016-06-14 13:57:23	na_th_an	this kinda happens around install times I've noticed
2016-06-14 13:57:30	na_th_an	it's dumb
2016-06-14 13:57:48	na_th_an	I might have this kibana thing done today tho
2016-06-14 13:57:50	na_th_an	"done"
2016-06-14 13:57:55	na_th_an	until they decided to change what they want
2016-06-14 14:26:37	frappuccino	im still fucking around with these unit tests this is awful
2016-06-14 14:27:32	frappuccino	this might be worse than search controller
2016-06-14 14:28:12	na_th_an	what class is it?
2016-06-14 14:28:31	frappuccino	BibServiceESLTest
2016-06-14 14:28:43	frappuccino	its like awkwardly mixing mocking and normal unit testing
2016-06-14 14:30:47	frappuccino	i almost said "the thing you dont go to because it gives you cancer"
2016-06-14 15:06:10	frappuccino	what
2016-06-14 15:06:11	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-14 15:06:28	na_th_an	what?
2016-06-14 15:06:35	frappuccino	what is eric talking about
2016-06-14 15:06:38	na_th_an	what
2016-06-14 15:06:40	na_th_an	oh
2016-06-14 15:06:42	na_th_an	I saw
2016-06-14 15:06:44	na_th_an	just now
2016-06-14 15:06:46	na_th_an	wtf
2016-06-14 15:07:12	frappuccino	fuck you jetbrains
2016-06-14 15:07:36	na_th_an	eric would be pissed off if he bought a sockt wrench because he's used to being able to loosen and tighten at the same time with the same wrench
2016-06-14 15:07:45	na_th_an	"but eric it's much more convenient. It's just an extra step to change the direction."
2016-06-14 15:07:57	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-14 15:07:58	na_th_an	but it's different, and not what he was expecting
2016-06-14 15:08:00	na_th_an	thus wrong
2016-06-14 15:08:27	na_th_an	"My old wrench let me loosen or tighten anything! Now I need sockets for each and every bolt size? Ridiculous!"
2016-06-14 15:08:42	na_th_an	while every single professional mechanic swears by their socket set
2016-06-14 15:08:48	na_th_an	eric is over there struggling with his cresent wrench
2016-06-14 15:08:51	frappuccino	i hate him
2016-06-14 15:08:51	na_th_an	"It's better I swear!"
2016-06-14 15:09:16	frappuccino	so lets review what he was complaining about
2016-06-14 15:09:26	frappuccino	he was accidentally holding down some keys?
2016-06-14 15:09:33	frappuccino	so he wrote a bunch of shit to a file?
2016-06-14 15:09:36	frappuccino	instead of undoing
2016-06-14 15:09:38	frappuccino	he clsoed the filed
2016-06-14 15:09:56	frappuccino	hoping the changes would go away
2016-06-14 15:09:59	frappuccino	then reopened
2016-06-14 15:10:05	frappuccino	then got mad that changes were still there
2016-06-14 15:10:06	na_th_an	1) eric fell asleep
2016-06-14 15:10:14	na_th_an	2) he mashed some keys
2016-06-14 15:10:39	frappuccino	i bet he tried to make changes and fucked everything up
2016-06-14 15:10:47	frappuccino	why wouldn't he just undo "leaning" on a few keys
2016-06-14 15:10:52	frappuccino	my first thought we be to revert lol
2016-06-14 15:10:58	frappuccino	if i couldnt undo
2016-06-14 15:11:10	na_th_an	I hate how intellij still uses 'revert' in the GUI when you're using git
2016-06-14 15:11:11	frappuccino	i cant believe he thought closing the file would get rid of the changes lol
2016-06-14 15:11:17	frappuccino	yeah thats annoying
2016-06-14 15:11:21	frappuccino	but i dont use that so
2016-06-14 15:11:23	frappuccino	well i guess i do
2016-06-14 15:11:24	frappuccino	sometimes
2016-06-14 15:11:26	frappuccino	but still
2016-06-14 15:11:27	na_th_an	I've used that a few times
2016-06-14 15:11:28	frappuccino	dont really care
2016-06-14 15:11:32	na_th_an	ya it's nbd
2016-06-14 15:11:35	na_th_an	I mean
2016-06-14 15:11:37	na_th_an	fuck jetbrains
2016-06-14 15:11:40	na_th_an	trash product
2016-06-14 15:11:46	frappuccino	is he gonna dodge
2016-06-14 15:11:57	na_th_an	ofc
2016-06-14 15:12:05	frappuccino	did he expect us to be like "ohh yaaa autosave sucksksssss"
2016-06-14 15:13:05	na_th_an	ya that one time when I alt-tabbed to my browser and all my frontend resources autosaved and then refreshed my browser
2016-06-14 15:13:07	na_th_an	that was shit
2016-06-14 15:13:11	na_th_an	was not expecting
2016-06-14 15:13:22	na_th_an	I ended up having one of those farts where it's kinda wet because I was so surprised
2016-06-14 15:13:25	na_th_an	I had to go home
2016-06-14 15:13:28	na_th_an	fucking intellij
2016-06-14 15:13:45	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-14 15:16:07	frappuccino	"now some file is edited and I dont even understand how"
2016-06-14 15:16:12	frappuccino	"did you edit it"
2016-06-14 15:16:18	frappuccino	"i leaned on a few keys"
2016-06-14 15:16:24	frappuccino	... it seems like you understand how
2016-06-14 15:16:27	frappuccino	or youre lying lol
2016-06-14 15:16:41	na_th_an	it's just another case of Eric making a mistake
2016-06-14 15:16:48	na_th_an	in this case, probably falling asleep and messing up a file
2016-06-14 15:16:57	na_th_an	and the results having nothing to do with his mistake
2016-06-14 15:17:03	na_th_an	but everything to do with intellij sucking
2016-06-14 15:29:06	frappuccino	what was that about
2016-06-14 15:29:29	na_th_an	making graphs
2016-06-14 15:29:32	na_th_an	check out my graphs
2016-06-14 15:29:41	na_th_an	cathy won't tell me what graphs to make
2016-06-14 15:29:47	na_th_an	so rashmi just said to make something and be smart
2016-06-14 15:29:51	na_th_an	and if they don't like it too bad
2016-06-14 15:29:58	na_th_an	she's been fine since she's come back
2016-06-14 15:30:04	na_th_an	other than her voice and head nodding
2016-06-14 15:34:45	frappuccino	yeah

2016-06-14 15:42:55	na_th_an	I'd pass that on a code review but I'm not a tech lead
2016-06-14 15:43:11	frappuccino	idk why that mock isnt working
2016-06-14 15:44:09	frappuccino	should i just not mock it

2016-06-20 15:08:34	keveloper	keveloper the developer what you want me to develop for
2016-06-20 15:09:04	keveloper	that should be in my fish config
2016-06-20 15:10:59	keveloper	trump or clinton
2016-06-20 15:11:25	keveloper	like they both suck
2016-06-20 15:11:40	keveloper	and was that poll actually correct
2016-06-20 15:12:18	na_th_an	I've lost all ability to work
2016-06-20 15:12:22	na_th_an	what poll
2016-06-20 15:12:23	keveloper	lol
2016-06-20 15:12:32	keveloper	something showed hillary polling way above trump
2016-06-20 15:12:40	na_th_an	oh I think I know what you're talking about
2016-06-20 15:12:46	keveloper	is that true
2016-06-20 15:12:46	na_th_an	the huffington post aggregation over time
2016-06-20 15:13:02	na_th_an	it's true that something like 77% of americans have a disfavorable view of trump
2016-06-20 15:13:08	keveloper	yeah
2016-06-20 15:13:08	na_th_an	and yes her polling is better I believe
2016-06-20 15:13:10	keveloper	sounds right
2016-06-20 15:13:16	keveloper	they both suck
2016-06-20 15:13:20	keveloper	but i think hillary sucks less
2016-06-20 15:13:22	na_th_an	at this point I don't think he has a chance
2016-06-20 15:13:29	na_th_an	hillary definitely sucks less
2016-06-20 15:13:31	keveloper	thats good at least
2016-06-20 15:13:44	na_th_an	I'm interested to see what's gonna happen with Gary Johnson
2016-06-20 15:13:51	keveloper	i have no idea who that is
2016-06-20 15:13:58	na_th_an	he's the libertarian candidate
2016-06-20 15:14:00	keveloper	oh okay
2016-06-20 15:14:09	na_th_an	some people like Jill Stein
2016-06-20 15:14:12	na_th_an	she's the green party candidate
2016-06-20 15:14:21	na_th_an	but I do not unless her views on medicine have changed dramatically
2016-06-20 15:14:28	keveloper	i bet its just gonna end up being hillary honestly
2016-06-20 15:14:42	na_th_an	I bet that too
2016-06-20 15:14:48	na_th_an	if you don't count my literal bet on trump
2016-06-20 15:14:48	keveloper	which i honestly dont care about that much because the president can't do *that* much
2016-06-20 15:14:57	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-20 15:15:06	keveloper	i think people forget about that lol
2016-06-20 15:15:11	keveloper	like the whole checks and balances thign
2016-06-20 15:15:22	na_th_an	there are SOME things that are gonna happen that will have long term importance
2016-06-20 15:15:27	na_th_an	like decisions to go bomb libya
2016-06-20 15:15:33	na_th_an	or supreme court appointments
2016-06-20 15:15:38	keveloper	yeah
2016-06-20 15:15:42	na_th_an	but yeah for the most part I agree
2016-06-20 15:15:51	keveloper	i hope she doesn't go bomb libya
2016-06-20 15:15:54	na_th_an	she already did
2016-06-20 15:15:57	na_th_an	so
2016-06-20 15:15:59	keveloper	can we just not go bomb anybody
2016-06-20 15:16:01	na_th_an	no
2016-06-20 15:16:07	keveloper	no bombing
2016-06-20 15:16:16	keveloper	if i was president i would like never attack anyone lol
2016-06-20 15:16:24	keveloper	unless someone was like "we will attack you"
2016-06-20 15:16:30	keveloper	i'd be like uh no thank you
2016-06-20 15:16:44	keveloper	here have some bombs

2016-06-20 15:17:03	na_th_an	whenever I think about the whole situtaion in the middle easth I think about this

2016-06-20 15:17:46	keveloper	lol
2016-06-20 15:18:41	keveloper	i think not bombing anyone is good
2016-06-20 15:18:46	keveloper	not bombing is good
2016-06-20 15:18:48	keveloper	no bombs
2016-06-20 15:19:07	na_th_an	there are sometimes that bombing is a better idea than not
2016-06-20 15:19:07	keveloper	and also no killing like 50 gay people thats not good either
2016-06-20 15:19:08	keveloper	wtf
2016-06-20 15:19:13	keveloper	yeah i guess so
2016-06-20 15:19:17	keveloper	like bombing china
2016-06-20 15:19:18	keveloper	no just kidding
2016-06-20 15:19:37	na_th_an	I think a strong argument can be made that dropping the nukes on Japan ended up being more moral than fighting a traditional war
2016-06-20 15:19:41	keveloper	if i was president my speeches would be like "can we just like stop shooting people?"
2016-06-20 15:19:51	na_th_an	yeah I wouldn't be able to do this politician crap
2016-06-20 15:19:54	keveloper	na_th_an: ehhhhh ya
2016-06-20 15:19:57	keveloper	civilians though
2016-06-20 15:19:58	na_th_an	I'd be up there like "fucking seriously guys?"
2016-06-20 15:20:09	keveloper	"like what the fuck? why?"
2016-06-20 15:20:45	na_th_an	"Stay home and think about yourself. Think about your neighbor. Try not to shoot anyone tomorrow maybe? Fuck."
2016-06-20 15:21:16	na_th_an	if the war had continued it would have lasted another few years
2016-06-20 15:21:32	na_th_an	the overall loss of life would have been higher on both sides
2016-06-20 15:21:39	na_th_an	lost economic potential
2016-06-20 15:21:43	keveloper	"So like, gay people don't really affect you, its not like they are trying to kiss you? So why do you care? Stop shooting them please?"
2016-06-20 15:21:47	na_th_an	our relations ended up being pretty good
2016-06-20 15:22:07	keveloper	ya so that we dont do it again lol
2016-06-20 15:22:31	keveloper	did you hear about the plan of dropping bats carrying grenades
2016-06-20 15:22:39	na_th_an	I did not
2016-06-20 15:22:43	keveloper	but it was dropped after the manhattan project took off
2016-06-20 15:23:00	keveloper	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat_bomb

2016-06-20 15:24:41	keveloper	lol
2016-06-20 15:24:56	keveloper	The bat bomb was conceived by a Pennsylvania dentist named Lytle S. Adams, a friend of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt
2016-06-20 15:25:02	keveloper	oh thats how this dumb ass idea got so far

2016-06-20 16:23:15	frappuccino	like
2016-06-20 16:23:17	frappuccino	so hard
2016-06-20 16:23:22	frappuccino	but im not gonna say anything
2016-06-20 16:23:41	frappuccino	"yeah especially when they stop showing up to class"
2016-06-20 16:23:55	frappuccino	"yeah especially when they dont turn in projects"
2016-06-20 16:24:11	na_th_an	"especially when the don't show up to group projects with your actual friends"
2016-06-20 16:24:15	frappuccino	"yeah especially when they dont do anything in group projects"
2016-06-20 16:24:17	na_th_an	"after you said you would"
2016-06-20 16:24:22	frappuccino	"yeah especially when they dont show up for finals"
2016-06-20 16:24:23	na_th_an	"and then you stop responding to texts"
2016-06-20 16:24:31	frappuccino	"yeah especially when they fail stats 3 times
2016-06-20 16:24:32	na_th_an	"and then don't even come to happy hour"
2016-06-20 16:24:41	na_th_an	because they're SO busy studying
2016-06-20 16:24:48	frappuccino	"yeah especially when they take 6 years to get a 4 year degree"
2016-06-20 16:24:49	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-20 16:25:04	frappuccino	"yeah especially when they act like they are so busy studying but can't pass the class"
2016-06-20 16:25:34	na_th_an	I have no idea what he does with his time
2016-06-20 16:25:40	na_th_an	my working theory
2016-06-20 16:25:49	na_th_an	is that he wakes up really late and doesn't start his day until 11
2016-06-20 16:26:00	na_th_an	which means he doesn't actually get dressed and shit until 12 or so
2016-06-20 16:26:07	na_th_an	so then it's class/food for a bit
2016-06-20 16:26:12	na_th_an	and he'll study until 7 or so
2016-06-20 16:26:19	na_th_an	then it's "man I'm so tired gotta do other shit"
2016-06-20 16:26:26	na_th_an	and he procrastinates on stuff he should be doing all night
2016-06-20 16:26:28	na_th_an	stays up way too late
2016-06-20 16:26:31	na_th_an	boom
2016-06-20 16:26:34	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-20 16:26:34	na_th_an	repeat
2016-06-20 16:26:38	frappuccino	college wasn't that hard
2016-06-20 16:26:48	frappuccino	like it was a lot of work
2016-06-20 16:26:51	na_th_an	OSU was pretty hard
2016-06-20 16:27:04	na_th_an	it depends on the professors
2016-06-20 16:27:05	frappuccino	well yeah it was difficult
2016-06-20 16:27:08	frappuccino	but like in the scheme of things
2016-06-20 16:27:17	na_th_an	but a lot of them will put things on tests to fuck with people
2016-06-20 16:27:23	frappuccino	you finished in 4.5 years with what 3.?
2016-06-20 16:27:32	na_th_an	maybe a 3.0 idk

2016-06-22 08:38:28	na_th_an	I hadn't ever thought that
2016-06-22 08:38:42	na_th_an	she's like the stereotypical manager that doesn't know anything
2016-06-22 08:38:50	na_th_an	and speaks manager talk
2016-06-22 08:38:59	keveloper	idk if this is mean but i hope she doesn't go far because she doesn't seem to have good intentions

2016-06-22 08:43:49	keveloper	and i get emails from them about this ubiquity shit, and they copy paste an error, and they are like "how do i fix this?"
2016-06-22 08:43:53	keveloper	and me and jeff are like idfk?
2016-06-22 08:43:56	keveloper	then we google it

2016-06-22 08:44:10	keveloper	so i replied with a link
2016-06-22 08:44:12	keveloper	like
2016-06-22 08:44:23	na_th_an	yeah but did it tell you how to fix it in ubiquity?
2016-06-22 08:44:29	keveloper	lol what

2016-06-22 10:44:38	keveloper	can you help instruct? I think it's a GREAT idea for you and Nathan to get that out in front of folk! Start with our teams and then see how we can "socialize" it
2016-06-22 10:44:41	na_th_an	the OG JJ
2016-06-22 10:44:41	keveloper	says bill

2016-06-22 10:50:01	keveloper	emphasize git learning curve lol because there definitely is one
2016-06-22 10:50:22	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-22 12:37:43	na_th_an	based on what I know about Eric I'm going to say the problem is on his end and not OVH
2016-06-22 12:37:50	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:37:53	na_th_an	unless it's OVH's fault for not just starting over
2016-06-22 12:37:58	keveloper	hahahahhahaa
2016-06-22 12:38:41	keveloper	yeah he is wrong lol
2016-06-22 12:38:51	keveloper	"i figured it out"
2016-06-22 12:38:54	keveloper	"ovh sucks"
2016-06-22 12:38:56	keveloper	lolol
2016-06-22 12:40:09	keveloper	wtf is he doing
2016-06-22 12:40:18	keveloper	i think he is just fucking up his ssh config without knowing whats going on lol
2016-06-22 12:40:24	keveloper	i didnt have to do anything when i got my server
2016-06-22 12:40:32	na_th_an	yeah I have no idea why he's touching his ssh config
2016-06-22 12:40:47	keveloper	what
2016-06-22 12:40:48	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:41:00	na_th_an	I have no words
2016-06-22 12:41:04	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:42:55	keveloper	lol the fact that he has the confidence to blame this entire thing on ovh
2016-06-22 12:43:38	na_th_an	I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm sure about this: these problems are not caused by my lack of understanding
2016-06-22 12:44:04	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:44:10	keveloper	like
2016-06-22 12:44:11	keveloper	just
2016-06-22 12:44:11	keveloper	what
2016-06-22 12:44:48	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:45:00	na_th_an	obviously you didn't
2016-06-22 12:45:06	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:45:09	keveloper	"its OVHs fault"
2016-06-22 12:45:11	na_th_an	this is ridiculous
2016-06-22 12:45:17	na_th_an	just once I'd like him to be like
2016-06-22 12:45:20	na_th_an	"oh I didn't know that"
2016-06-22 12:45:21	keveloper	"i was wrong"
2016-06-22 12:45:23	na_th_an	"oh I didn't understand that"
2016-06-22 12:45:33	keveloper	p sure i've already done that today
2016-06-22 12:48:40	keveloper	"so far my experience with ovh has not been great"
2016-06-22 12:50:25	keveloper	saying "i have servers in chicago and quebec" sounds so much cooler than it is lol
2016-06-22 12:52:25	na_th_an	at this point I'm just impressed at his ability to truly believe that every problem he has is somebody else's fault
2016-06-22 12:52:52	na_th_an	and to not feel any kind of anxiety over taking 6 years to graduate college and sucking at or not even doing your job
2016-06-22 12:53:31	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:53:39	keveloper	whats the dep for java web apps called
2016-06-22 12:53:45	keveloper	quinton is asking for help

2016-06-22 12:53:51	na_th_an	what?
2016-06-22 12:53:59	keveloper	he wants to deploy it
2016-06-22 12:54:03	keveloper	im like idk ask a team member
2016-06-22 12:54:17	na_th_an	that's not a question that you can answer without knowing a lot more about the project
2016-06-22 12:54:34	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:54:39	keveloper	its maven
2016-06-22 12:54:45	keveloper	and not spring
2016-06-22 12:54:46	keveloper	its battelle
2016-06-22 12:54:51	keveloper	so im assuming j2ee webapp ftw
2016-06-22 12:54:55	keveloper	mvn run?
2016-06-22 12:54:57	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:55:13	na_th_an	idk, package a war and drop it in tomcat?
2016-06-22 12:55:23	keveloper	thats a maven task
2016-06-22 12:55:30	keveloper	intelliJ tomcat config
2016-06-22 12:55:30	na_th_an	what
2016-06-22 12:55:36	keveloper	to deploy to tomcat
2016-06-22 12:55:38	keveloper	maven plugin
2016-06-22 12:55:44	na_th_an	you're just saying words
2016-06-22 12:55:53	na_th_an	I have no idea how you're trying to connect them
2016-06-22 12:56:19	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:56:26	keveloper	intelliJ tomcat run config is one way
2016-06-22 12:56:35	keveloper	maven plugin to deploy artifact to tomcat is another
2016-06-22 12:56:38	na_th_an	are you saying that it's one way to run a project
2016-06-22 12:56:42	keveloper	yes
2016-06-22 12:56:43	na_th_an	or one way that he knows he can run his project
2016-06-22 12:56:49	keveloper	to run a project
2016-06-22 12:56:52	keveloper	im assuming his
2016-06-22 12:56:59	keveloper	i've made the assumption that its a j2ee webapp
2016-06-22 12:56:59	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:57:03	keveloper	so
2016-06-22 12:57:09	na_th_an	if we're just listing possible ways that a java webapp could be started we'll be here all day
2016-06-22 12:57:11	keveloper	i feel like im supposed to like gradle more
2016-06-22 12:57:13	keveloper	but i just dont
2016-06-22 12:57:19	keveloper	i dont like it very much at all lol
2016-06-22 12:57:23	na_th_an	he should be able to figure some shit out by looking at the pom
2016-06-22 12:57:27	na_th_an	gradle is okay
2016-06-22 12:57:31	keveloper	i like maven more
2016-06-22 12:57:32	keveloper	i've decided
2016-06-22 12:57:40	na_th_an	if we tried to what we do in gradle in maven it'd be way way worse
2016-06-22 12:57:42	keveloper	or maybe i've just seen shit build.gradles
2016-06-22 12:57:43	na_th_an	trust me
2016-06-22 12:57:55	na_th_an	a basic pom.xml is fine and good
2016-06-22 12:58:06	na_th_an	but once you start trying to do more than a basic build with it, maven become awful
2016-06-22 12:58:08	keveloper	like what
2016-06-22 12:58:10	keveloper	the REL thing?
2016-06-22 12:58:14	keveloper	i guess so
2016-06-22 12:58:18	keveloper	our build shit so gross
2016-06-22 12:58:19	keveloper	build.gradle
2016-06-22 12:58:24	na_th_an	I'm not going to say it isn't gross
2016-06-22 12:58:27	na_th_an	and it could be a lot better
2016-06-22 12:58:35	na_th_an	but if it were maven it'd be worse
2016-06-22 12:58:38	keveloper	i dont even know how to do a dependency in gradle
2016-06-22 12:58:41	keveloper	is that the classpath thing
2016-06-22 12:58:53	na_th_an	there's a dependency closure in gradle
2016-06-22 12:59:02	na_th_an	you add dependencies there
2016-06-22 12:59:11	keveloper	and what are the configurations things
2016-06-22 12:59:18	na_th_an	idk what you're talking about
2016-06-22 12:59:41	keveloper	its a thing
2016-06-22 12:59:55	na_th_an	I'm not saying it's not a thing
2016-06-22 13:00:02	na_th_an	I'm just saying idk what thing you're talking about
2016-06-22 13:00:12	keveloper	http://git.ent.oclc.org/projects/DISC/repos/discoveryui/browse/build.gradle#436
2016-06-22 13:00:17	keveloper	ya i was linking
2016-06-22 13:01:16	na_th_an	dealing with dependencies of dependencies
2016-06-22 13:01:28	na_th_an	dependencies will pull in other logging/testing frameworks that we don't want
2016-06-22 13:01:30	na_th_an	so we exclude them
2016-06-22 13:01:31	keveloper	maybe i'll write a gradle thing
2016-06-22 13:01:46	keveloper	i wanna write that pretty looking thing that was gonna basically be momentum but
2016-06-22 13:02:08	keveloper	i wonder if i could write a good android launcher
2016-06-22 13:02:58	keveloper	to be fast pretty and productive
2016-06-22 13:03:02	keveloper	i kinda wanna do that
2016-06-22 13:03:28	na_th_an	I was trying to think of VR game ideas yesterday
2016-06-22 13:03:32	keveloper	ok
2016-06-22 13:03:46	na_th_an	where you could have like 1-3 people on their phones
2016-06-22 13:03:50	na_th_an	and then 1 person in VR
2016-06-22 13:03:53	keveloper	ooh
2016-06-22 13:03:56	na_th_an	and have some kind of a multiplayer experience
2016-06-22 13:04:25	keveloper	you could do some assitant type thing like that wii u super mario
2016-06-22 13:04:46	keveloper	or the person on the phone could touch to drop drone things or something that you shoot
2016-06-22 13:04:55	keveloper	the vr person is defending something
2016-06-22 13:04:57	na_th_an	I was thinking co-op would be good
2016-06-22 13:05:00	keveloper	the phone person is attacking it
2016-06-22 13:05:05	keveloper	by dropping like minions
2016-06-22 13:05:07	keveloper	or other way around
2016-06-22 13:05:24	keveloper	like baloon tower defence
2016-06-22 13:05:30	keveloper	except you are in vr attack the towers
2016-06-22 13:05:34	keveloper	and the player puts them down
2016-06-22 13:06:13	keveloper	i'd wanna make some dope gun mechanisms
2016-06-22 13:06:25	keveloper	like when you reload you have to pull the clip out the put a new one in the cock it
2016-06-22 13:06:52	keveloper	and to switch firing modes you have to look at the side of the gun and flip the switch
2016-06-22 13:07:12	keveloper	and you lean down close to the controller to look in the scope
2016-06-22 13:07:28	keveloper	and you are making your way through some field thing and there is cover
2016-06-22 13:07:36	keveloper	and the person on the phone is like order troops or something
2016-06-22 13:07:37	na_th_an	battledome has an assault rifle with a scope
2016-06-22 13:07:39	keveloper	like strategy style
2016-06-22 13:07:41	na_th_an	I was wrecknig with it last night
2016-06-22 13:07:44	keveloper	strategy vs fps
2016-06-22 13:07:56	keveloper	do you like my idea lol
2016-06-22 13:08:04	na_th_an	yeah it's got good parts to it
2016-06-22 13:08:13	keveloper	>:O THE WHOLE THING IS GOOD lol
2016-06-22 13:08:13	na_th_an	multiplayer tower defense would be cool
2016-06-22 13:40:54	keveloper	so
2016-06-22 13:40:57	keveloper	quinton just said
2016-06-22 13:41:30	keveloper	"so according to guys here, if i want to acces it through "localhost:8080" I'll have to manually copy the front end from the repository voer to tomcat's ROOT folder very time i make a change"
2016-06-22 13:41:37	keveloper	"it makes sense but seems wrong"
2016-06-22 13:41:38	keveloper	i said
2016-06-22 13:41:47	keveloper	lol thats how you did it in 1994 yeah
2016-06-22 13:41:57	keveloper	jeez battelle tf are you doing
2016-06-22 13:42:35	na_th_an	don't be quite so facicious
2016-06-22 13:42:40	na_th_an	that's more 2004 than 1994
2016-06-22 13:42:42	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 13:42:50	keveloper	okay but still
2016-06-22 13:42:58	na_th_an	that's the answer patrick would give you
2016-06-22 13:43:10	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 13:44:11	keveloper	do you wanna meet today or something to talk about what we're gonna do for friday
2016-06-22 13:44:22	na_th_an	I think we should wait until next friday
2016-06-22 13:44:27	keveloper	why
2016-06-22 13:44:41	na_th_an	unless we don't want to actually do a deployment
2016-06-22 13:44:45	na_th_an	and only talk about git
2016-06-22 13:45:22	keveloper	yeah i think thatd be good
2016-06-22 13:45:41	keveloper	git focussed one time to cover things that aren't covered in the typical workflow
2016-06-22 13:45:42	keveloper	like reset
2016-06-22 13:45:46	keveloper	idk how jeff didn't know about that
2016-06-22 13:45:53	keveloper	should probably show source tree stuff for a sec
2016-06-22 13:45:53	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-22 13:46:00	na_th_an	talk about intellij and CLI a bit
2016-06-22 13:46:02	keveloper	i always have sourcetree ready to back me out of git holes lol
2016-06-22 13:46:03	keveloper	yeah
2016-06-22 13:46:05	na_th_an	bc mark won't use the cli for some reason
2016-06-22 13:46:12	na_th_an	I've never used sourcetree
2016-06-22 13:46:18	keveloper	its incredible
2016-06-22 13:46:19	na_th_an	I think it would be good to mention but idk if we should show it
2016-06-22 13:46:20	keveloper	so do you wanna meet
2016-06-22 13:46:26	na_th_an	intellij + cli is already a lot
2016-06-22 13:46:30	na_th_an	adding a 3rd thing is even more
2016-06-22 13:46:44	keveloper	i'd rather new git devs use source tree over cli

2016-06-27 10:18:40	keveloper	and i was like "is this a preset theme or did you set up this homepage" and she was like "i set it up
2016-06-27 10:18:58	keveloper	idk what youre huhing
2016-06-27 10:19:06	na_th_an	not like
2016-06-27 10:19:08	na_th_an	"huh?"
2016-06-27 10:19:11	na_th_an	but
2016-06-27 10:19:13	na_th_an	huh.
2016-06-27 10:19:16	keveloper	oh i got you
2016-06-27 10:19:17	keveloper	idk
2016-06-27 10:19:20	keveloper	maybe for stephene
2016-06-27 10:19:22	keveloper	stephen
2016-06-27 10:19:23	keveloper	idk dude
2016-06-27 10:19:24	na_th_an	idk

2016-06-27 10:19:45	keveloper	but they are getting here tomorrow
2016-06-27 10:19:47	keveloper	dammit amazon
2016-06-27 10:19:57	na_th_an	I feel like she's said things in the past to the effect of her not wanting to date stephen because of religion but I could be compeltely and totally wrong about that
2016-06-27 10:20:35	keveloper	the bible app would be explained by her not setting up that homepage but it being from a theme
2016-06-27 10:21:03	keveloper	which i think is the case because i was like "what is this dancing person icon" and she couldn't rememeber what the app was for like 20 seconds
2016-06-27 10:21:05	na_th_an	how would the app get there in the first place?
2016-06-27 10:21:17	na_th_an	I've never had a bible app on my phone
2016-06-27 10:21:19	na_th_an	personally
2016-06-27 10:21:27	na_th_an	and I grew up in a very religious family
2016-06-27 10:21:37	keveloper	when you download themes all of the icons come with
2016-06-27 10:21:41	keveloper	even if you dont have the apps
2016-06-27 10:21:48	keveloper	and when you click on them it takes you to them in the store
2016-06-27 10:21:59	keveloper	is what i assume happened
2016-06-27 10:22:01	na_th_an	oh
2016-06-27 10:22:04	na_th_an	idk
2016-06-27 10:22:17	na_th_an	it doesn't do that with the cyanogenmod themes
2016-06-27 10:22:25	keveloper	nova launcher
2016-06-27 10:22:29	keveloper	it might not happen on nova launcher
2016-06-27 10:22:34	keveloper	some other ones i've tried do that
2016-06-27 10:23:13	na_th_an	I haven't done much/any theming on my phones
2016-06-27 10:23:23	na_th_an	ok so that journal of thing
2016-06-27 10:23:27	keveloper	i like to try to get the best look i can get
2016-06-27 10:23:29	na_th_an	the same exact firefly query works in perf
2016-06-27 10:23:31	na_th_an	fails in prod
2016-06-27 10:23:34	keveloper	na_th_an: yeah
2016-06-27 10:23:38	keveloper	huh
2016-06-27 10:23:40	keveloper	oh
2016-06-27 10:23:51	keveloper	like when you change the domain to perf
2016-06-27 10:23:55	keveloper	but leave the request the same
2016-06-27 10:26:31	na_th_an	yes
2016-06-27 10:26:36	na_th_an	you change -perf.ent
2016-06-27 10:26:39	na_th_an	to -readonly.prod
2016-06-27 10:26:42	keveloper	lolol
2016-06-27 10:26:54	na_th_an	we never emailed dsisupport about this right?

2016-06-27 11:37:28	keveloper	talk about first gen technology this smart watch man
2016-06-27 11:37:47	na_th_an	I'm pretty fucking happy with my vive for it being first gen tech
2016-06-27 11:37:52	na_th_an	it amazes me
2016-06-27 11:38:09	keveloper	my watch is infuriatingly slow
2016-06-27 11:38:23	keveloper	im just gonna write my own lightweight os and run it on it

2016-06-27 11:43:07	na_th_an	makes me sad
2016-06-27 11:43:17	keveloper	i bet its actually good
2016-06-27 11:43:24	na_th_an	I bet it is
2016-06-27 11:43:27	keveloper	because first gen is not
2016-06-27 11:43:30	keveloper	and it dropped fast
2016-06-27 11:43:31	na_th_an	:(
2016-06-27 11:43:35	keveloper	i think im about to stop wearing it
2016-06-27 11:43:38	keveloper	idk what else to do
2016-06-27 11:43:38	na_th_an	do you regret

2016-06-27 13:07:17	keveloper	lol
2016-06-27 14:09:29	keveloper	the non alcoholic beer thing would have been stupid
2016-06-27 14:10:24	na_th_an	...what?
2016-06-27 14:10:42	na_th_an	where did that come from
2016-06-27 14:11:21	keveloper	wrong chat lol
2016-06-27 14:11:44	keveloper	talking about an alternate ex machina ending
2016-06-27 14:12:17	na_th_an	oh
2016-06-27 14:12:21	na_th_an	never seen it
2016-06-27 15:53:04	keveloper	welp
2016-06-27 15:54:23	na_th_an	welp, the person who needed to do that the most couldn't get their computer working
2016-06-27 15:54:26	na_th_an	other than that it went well
2016-06-27 15:56:22	keveloper	lolol
2016-06-28 10:36:48	keveloper	"seems like a healthy guy"
2016-06-28 10:57:29	keveloper	fuckin jeff
2016-06-28 10:57:33	keveloper	acting annoyed with me
2016-06-28 10:57:38	keveloper	because im "doing it wrong"
2016-06-28 10:57:55	na_th_an	I didn't hear any of that
2016-06-28 10:58:00	keveloper	i was like the firefly record count is wrong
2016-06-28 10:58:05	keveloper	there are more than it says
2016-06-28 10:58:09	keveloper	thats why it misses
2016-06-28 10:58:22	na_th_an	so what'd jeff say
2016-06-28 10:58:24	keveloper	and jeffs like don't care about the count, just keep hitting next record
2016-06-28 10:58:35	keveloper	which is apparently a thing?
2016-06-28 10:58:40	na_th_an	yeah try that
2016-06-28 10:58:43	na_th_an	that's what I'd do
2016-06-28 10:58:47	keveloper	either way, the next record thing is there when youre not passed the count
2016-06-28 10:58:48	keveloper	no
2016-06-28 10:58:50	keveloper	it doesn't work
2016-06-28 10:58:53	keveloper	because the count is wrong
2016-06-28 10:59:05	keveloper	firefly doesn't know there are more records unless you ask for them
2016-06-28 10:59:10	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-28 10:59:11	keveloper	but you can start passed how many it thinks
2016-06-28 10:59:17	keveloper	so i can only get 499 more
2016-06-28 10:59:18	na_th_an	so keep asking for more records until it fails
2016-06-28 10:59:24	na_th_an	oh
2016-06-28 10:59:29	keveloper	you can only ask for 500 at a time
2016-06-28 10:59:30	na_th_an	so you can't actually get them all
2016-06-28 10:59:35	keveloper	yes
2016-06-28 10:59:37	na_th_an	did you mean
2016-06-28 10:59:48	na_th_an	"you can't start past how many it thinks"
2016-06-28 10:59:54	keveloper	yeah
2016-06-28 10:59:56	na_th_an	ok
2016-06-28 10:59:59	na_th_an	this makes sense now
2016-06-28 11:00:02	keveloper	if you do startRecord=max+1
2016-06-28 11:00:06	keveloper	its like "no records found"
2016-06-28 11:00:20	na_th_an	i see
2016-06-28 11:00:23	na_th_an	:(
2016-06-28 11:00:33	keveloper	how would i "click" that anyway
2016-06-28 11:00:41	keveloper	im doing like phatomjs or something
2016-06-28 11:00:49	na_th_an	you're using phantomjs?
2016-06-28 11:00:50	keveloper	i guess i could pull that url out of there and hit that i guess
2016-06-28 11:00:51	keveloper	no
2016-06-28 11:00:54	keveloper	im not*
2016-06-28 11:00:57	keveloper	using*
2016-06-28 11:00:58	keveloper	typing is hard
2016-06-28 11:01:11	keveloper	but either way that doesn't work because the next thing isn't there
2016-06-28 11:01:18	na_th_an	can you change the sort order somehow
2016-06-28 11:01:25	keveloper	probably
2016-06-28 11:01:29	na_th_an	so you get back records that you wouldn't otherwise
2016-06-28 11:01:30	keveloper	thats why we keep finding new ones
2016-06-28 11:01:37	keveloper	because they are newly modified
2016-06-28 11:01:42	keveloper	always get them back in the first 500
2016-06-28 11:01:50	na_th_an	yeah when this first came up after we fixed them "all" and more were broken
2016-06-28 11:01:57	na_th_an	I figured it was firefly not being able to index their own data correctly
2016-06-28 11:02:16	na_th_an	0/10 not surprised
2016-06-28 11:33:10	keveloper	ugh this question
2016-06-28 11:34:30	keveloper	i bet he's not pulling
2016-06-28 11:34:41	na_th_an	lol
2016-06-28 11:35:34	keveloper	i dont believe this guy
2016-06-28 11:35:41	na_th_an	I'm not paying attention
2016-06-28 11:35:47	na_th_an	I also don't know much about ubiquity
2016-06-28 11:35:54	na_th_an	I also want piada
2016-06-28 11:36:19	keveloper	i'm down
2016-06-28 11:36:24	keveloper	i am down as a doooowwwg
2016-06-28 11:36:27	keveloper	woof
2016-06-28 11:39:11	na_th_an	woof
2016-06-28 11:39:22	keveloper	lol
2016-06-28 11:39:22	keveloper	+1
2016-06-28 12:57:07	keveloper	it seems like jeff overcomplicates things sometimes
2016-06-28 12:58:29	keveloper	idk wtf im supposed to do with this list of ids
2016-06-28 13:00:14	na_th_an	yeah sometimes
2016-06-28 13:00:22	na_th_an	idk wtf you're supposed to do with it either
2016-06-28 13:33:24	na_th_an	ok so someone on the 4th floor had to shit really bad
2016-06-28 13:33:33	na_th_an	and got to the stall and and didn't quite make it
2016-06-28 13:33:40	na_th_an	and exploded onto the seat
2016-06-28 13:33:47	na_th_an	but then sat down on the shitty seat
2016-06-28 13:34:01	na_th_an	basically, if you need to poop, skip the 4th floor today
2016-06-28 13:36:55	keveloper	wait
2016-06-28 13:36:57	keveloper	ohhhhhhh
2016-06-28 13:36:59	keveloper	i thought you said
2016-06-28 13:37:06	keveloper	"but then i sat down on the shitty seat"
2016-06-28 13:37:10	na_th_an	lololol
2016-06-28 13:37:12	na_th_an	no I did not
2016-06-28 13:37:15	keveloper	i was like oh no
2016-06-28 13:37:29	na_th_an	look before you sit
2016-06-28 13:38:01	keveloper	always do
2016-06-28 13:39:46	keveloper	debugging this stupid script dammit
2016-06-28 13:40:56	keveloper	okay wwwwwwwtf
2016-06-28 13:49:29	keveloper	rashmi just talks to talk omg
2016-06-28 13:49:31	keveloper	i cant stand it
2016-06-28 13:49:40	na_th_an	i was wondering what was happening
2016-06-28 13:49:45	na_th_an	bc jinbin and jeff were both talking to her
2016-06-28 13:50:18	na_th_an	mark is asleep
2016-06-28 13:50:26	keveloper	she's always "like such as" blah blah blah
2016-06-28 13:50:41	keveloper	any time she says "like such as" im like okay the next 40 words wont matter
2016-06-28 13:52:15	keveloper	anyone wanna tell me why we dont change servers and keep the domains the same
2016-06-28 13:52:43	keveloper	do you have a legit reason for that
2016-06-28 13:55:07	na_th_an	there's a new naming scheme with bedrock
2016-06-28 13:55:19	na_th_an	because before names were based on the datacenter
2016-06-28 13:55:25	na_th_an	and datacenter == environment
2016-06-28 13:55:30	na_th_an	but now datacenter != environment
2016-06-28 13:55:47	na_th_an	because our NAT and Prod environment is going to span datacenters
2016-06-28 13:55:49	keveloper	ah
2016-06-28 14:22:34	keveloper	ugh
2016-06-28 14:22:38	keveloper	idk whats wrong with this script
2016-06-28 14:23:44	na_th_an	firefly
2016-06-28 14:52:41	keveloper	damn katie's so cute lol
2016-06-28 14:55:04	na_th_an	ya she is really cute
2016-06-28 14:57:51	keveloper	discuiap01dxm1.dev.oclc.org
2016-06-28 14:57:53	keveloper	new dev server
2016-06-28 14:57:58	keveloper	oops
2016-06-28 15:05:28	keveloper	na_th_an: back off bro
2016-06-28 15:11:40	na_th_an	huh
2016-06-28 15:14:31	keveloper	"do our servers have tmux or screen"
2016-06-28 15:14:36	keveloper	"nohup is the way you do it"
2016-06-28 15:14:40	keveloper	ugh whatever
2016-06-28 15:14:46	na_th_an	nuhup is generally more standard
2016-06-28 15:14:48	na_th_an	unfortunately
2016-06-28 15:15:14	na_th_an	tmux and screen are still cool people tools

2016-06-29 11:24:40	keveloper	?
2016-06-29 11:24:46	na_th_an	you can use double quotes as a string in bash
2016-06-29 11:24:50	keveloper	there are ' and "
2016-06-29 11:24:53	na_th_an	"this is a string"
2016-06-29 11:24:55	keveloper	in the ascii art
2016-06-29 11:24:58	na_th_an	idk what the diff between single and double is in bash
2016-06-29 11:25:01	keveloper	so they end the string

2016-06-29 14:15:50	na_th_an	or I seriously don't understand something
2016-06-29 14:26:41	na_th_an	one time I walked by andrew pace in the hallway and he was saying something like
2016-06-29 14:27:09	na_th_an	"someones gonna say something about how oclc's workforce isn't diverse and instead of actually being able to discuss the question skip is going to get all defensive and say we do"
2016-06-29 14:27:16	na_th_an	apparently skip is very defensive
2016-06-29 14:27:19	na_th_an	it shows in his ask skips
2016-06-29 14:27:35	na_th_an	and ya I'm pretty sure he is a dick
2016-06-29 14:27:43	keveloper	i think we have a decently diverse workforce
2016-06-29 14:27:48	keveloper	our team is pretty diverse at least
2016-06-29 14:27:59	keveloper	maybe that's generaly not true
2016-06-29 14:28:17	keveloper	65% is 46-58 year old white guy with mustaches so
2016-06-29 14:28:22	na_th_an	OCLC hires about 1/4 of the non-asian female CSE students at OSU

2016-06-29 14:28:55	na_th_an	and saw leah, sophie, claudia, and zach
2016-06-29 14:29:08	na_th_an	it was NOT representative of the OSU CSE student body at all
2016-06-29 14:29:32	na_th_an	I've had no more than 2 non-asian females in any of my classes

2016-06-30 10:47:32	na_th_an	idk what external search even is
2016-06-30 10:47:42	keveloper	do you think he got fired
2016-06-30 10:47:45	keveloper	or just randomly quit
2016-06-30 10:48:03	na_th_an	he probably quit
2016-06-30 10:48:18	na_th_an	he had a not so good divorce this year
2016-06-30 10:48:26	na_th_an	and it was just finalized
2016-06-30 10:48:33	na_th_an	so he's probably moving
2016-06-30 10:52:42	keveloper	ohh
2016-06-30 15:15:37	na_th_an	abby acting like she cares about QA

2016-06-30 15:16:28	na_th_an	I was in QA longer than she's been at oclc
2016-06-30 15:16:33	keveloper	me too lol
2016-06-30 15:16:41	keveloper	i was in qa longer than you
2016-06-30 15:16:51	na_th_an	I was in QA the whole time I was an intern
2016-06-30 15:16:51	keveloper	you went to middlewar
2016-06-30 15:16:54	na_th_an	technically
2016-06-30 15:17:26	na_th_an	I guess I probably wasn't technically QA when we were under Vic
2016-06-30 15:17:34	na_th_an	but when we got moved back under TJ I became QA again
2016-07-01 09:12:07	na_th_an	erik did get laid off I guess
2016-07-01 09:12:16	na_th_an	6 people did yestetrday

2016-07-01 09:13:07	na_th_an	no clue
2016-07-01 09:13:10	na_th_an	mike teets
2016-07-01 09:13:15	na_th_an	some people that worked in the phones
2016-07-01 09:13:21	na_th_an	idk nobody else I've ever heard of
2016-07-01 09:13:26	keveloper	mike teets got laid off wtf?
2016-07-01 09:13:31	na_th_an	apparently
2016-07-01 09:14:13	keveloper	is that in an email
2016-07-01 09:14:16	keveloper	where do you see that
2016-07-01 09:14:27	na_th_an	did you not see the email sent out yesterday about it
2016-07-01 09:14:33	keveloper	viewpoint?
2016-07-01 09:14:34	na_th_an	that mike teets was no longer at oclc
2016-07-01 09:14:38	na_th_an	no
2016-07-01 09:14:41	na_th_an	it was from jj
2016-07-01 09:14:44	na_th_an	about mike teets being gone
2016-07-01 09:14:50	keveloper	oh
2016-07-01 09:15:19	keveloper	" Mike Teets has decided it is time to make a change and will be leaving OCLC"
2016-07-01 09:15:47	keveloper	doesn't sound like laid off
2016-07-01 09:16:27	keveloper	So, today, when I caught myself muttering over “where the time went this year,” I immediately checked the mirror to see if I had somehow awakened decades older. Because that’s what it feels like to me when I say I’ve been at OCLC now for three years. Where did the time go?
2016-07-01 09:16:29	keveloper	wtf skip
2016-07-01 09:16:30	keveloper	lol
2016-07-01 09:17:20	na_th_an	yeah that was a bullshit viewpoint
2016-07-01 09:17:23	na_th_an	w/e
2016-07-01 09:17:26	na_th_an	I have a steering wheel in my bedroom
2016-07-01 09:17:32	keveloper	lol
2016-07-01 09:17:54	na_th_an	the force feedback was way cooler than I was expecting it to be
2016-07-01 09:19:04	keveloper	did anyone read that viewpoint like "wow inspirational" "such insight"
2016-07-01 09:19:18	na_th_an	yes
2016-07-01 09:19:21	na_th_an	I did

2016-07-06 10:26:56	na_th_an	but he wasn't working!
2016-07-06 10:27:05	na_th_an	honestly, if you're a full time student I don't think school is that hard
2016-07-06 10:27:18	keveloper	yeah it just takes up tons of time
2016-07-06 10:27:25	keveloper	and you have to be willing to dedicate your time
2016-07-06 10:27:28	na_th_an	if you're decent at managing your time you can get by with good grades and <40 hours a week of work easily
2016-07-06 10:27:33	keveloper	yeah
2016-07-06 10:27:41	na_th_an	if you actually work and don't fuck around

2016-07-06 10:28:05	na_th_an	he's probably one of the people that goes to the library and spends all day watching youtube and shit
2016-07-06 10:29:28	keveloper	"i was in the library all day studying"

2016-07-06 13:49:07	keveloper	instead of his like "i dunnnnnoooooooooo, im afraiiiiddd, what do YOU guys want to doooo" lol
2016-07-06 13:49:08	na_th_an	"work on X or leave"
2016-07-06 13:49:28	keveloper	i'm worried that X
2016-07-06 13:49:29	na_th_an	you won't get a bunch of devs to make something cool without any leadership or direction
2016-07-06 13:49:34	keveloper	ya
2016-07-06 13:49:41	keveloper	he needs to say fuck it and just do it
2016-07-06 13:49:44	keveloper	like our git thing
2016-07-06 13:49:48	keveloper	it was super awkward
2016-07-06 13:49:51	na_th_an	I *really* tried to get him to do that before
2016-07-06 13:49:54	keveloper	and it was half a joke before we did it
2016-07-06 13:49:58	na_th_an	and he did not seem interested at all in having a plan
2016-07-06 13:50:06	keveloper	and then we were just like whatever lets just do it
2016-07-06 13:50:14	keveloper	and it turned okay, and might not have helped very much
2016-07-06 13:50:18	keveloper	but we still 100% did it
2016-07-06 13:55:13	na_th_an	I think Ying got something out of that git thing
2016-07-06 13:55:26	na_th_an	and Jinbin kinda already knew what he was doing and I think it solidified some understanding
2016-07-06 13:55:34	na_th_an	I think it was probably a good use of time
2016-07-06 13:55:37	na_th_an	it didn't take much
2016-07-06 13:59:41	keveloper	chris evans on point again
2016-07-06 14:00:00	keveloper	just saw dads forehead

2016-07-06 14:17:09	keveloper	or maybe you
2016-07-06 14:17:20	na_th_an	sup
2016-07-06 14:17:21	keveloper	if you run the clear cache command on one host does it clear the cache for the entire app
2016-07-06 14:17:28	keveloper	(occ)
2016-07-06 14:17:38	na_th_an	umm
2016-07-06 14:17:44	keveloper	follow up: should the command only be run once?
2016-07-06 14:17:51	keveloper	when trying to flush the cache
2016-07-06 14:17:51	na_th_an	there was a thing jeff said about akamai recently and taht
2016-07-06 14:18:18	keveloper	i think when you add the word "local" to an occ command, it only runs it on that host
2016-07-06 14:18:22	na_th_an	yeah
2016-07-06 14:18:26	na_th_an	something like that
2016-07-06 14:18:26	keveloper	i *think*
2016-07-06 14:18:31	keveloper	i do not *know*
2016-07-06 14:18:34	na_th_an	and/or * means all hosts
2016-07-06 14:18:53	keveloper	"local execute command only on this host [OPTIONAL]"
2016-07-06 14:19:07	keveloper	local is bold there
2016-07-06 14:19:12	keveloper	but... ascii... so
2016-07-06 14:32:18	keveloper	chris evans for the winagin

2016-07-06 15:39:50	na_th_an	they are right by each other

2016-07-06 15:39:55	na_th_an	abby and stephen
2016-07-06 15:40:01	keveloper	did w not go
2016-07-06 15:40:12	na_th_an	I don't think so but idxk

2016-07-06 15:40:39	keveloper	talking about what to code
2016-07-06 15:40:50	na_th_an	probably
2016-07-06 15:40:55	keveloper	great
2016-07-06 15:43:15	keveloper	DUI CSDC install on friday \o/
2016-07-06 15:43:28	na_th_an	for ubiquity?

2016-07-06 15:49:49	keveloper	wait what
2016-07-06 15:49:53	keveloper	stephen was in standup
2016-07-06 15:49:57	keveloper	then where is abby lol
2016-07-06 15:50:37	na_th_an	abby left at 3:30 or whenever it starts
2016-07-06 15:50:53	na_th_an	just like, immediately came back and left
2016-07-06 15:50:56	na_th_an	bc excuse to do no work
2016-07-06 15:51:18	keveloper	wait immediately came back? from what
2016-07-06 15:51:22	keveloper	meeting?
2016-07-06 15:51:23	keveloper	then left?
2016-07-06 15:51:29	na_th_an	ya
2016-07-06 15:51:32	na_th_an	p sure
2016-07-06 15:51:36	keveloper	i wonder if rothlan is here
2016-07-06 15:51:46	keveloper	i dont see him
2016-07-06 15:52:08	na_th_an	those 2 probably went to go see thed ogs
2016-07-06 15:53:23	keveloper	lol
2016-07-06 15:53:34	keveloper	he should do a starter code thing
2016-07-06 15:53:42	keveloper	because getting started on something takes forever
2016-07-06 15:54:01	keveloper	but starter code can speed things up a lot
2016-07-06 15:54:06	na_th_an	yeah I suggested that to him
2016-07-06 15:54:08	keveloper	and get you into the important part faster
2016-07-06 15:54:14	na_th_an	that he should have a thing set up
2016-07-06 15:54:16	na_th_an	so we get started faster
2016-07-06 15:54:19	keveloper	spring boot project
2016-07-06 15:54:21	keveloper	hello world
2016-07-06 15:54:24	keveloper	then we have to make some restful thing
2016-07-06 15:54:26	keveloper	in pairs of 2
2016-07-06 15:54:30	keveloper	design and make it really quick
2016-07-06 15:54:30	na_th_an	but that violates the "I don't want to tell anyone what to do" tenant
2016-07-06 15:54:34	keveloper	true
2016-07-06 15:54:52	keveloper	and the exercise could be to use new models and libraries you normally don't use
2016-07-06 15:54:53	keveloper	like kotlin
2016-07-06 15:55:00	keveloper	or scala
2016-07-06 15:55:03	keveloper	or lombok
2016-07-06 15:55:07	keveloper	and h2
2016-07-06 15:55:10	keveloper	or sqlite
2016-07-06 15:55:15	na_th_an	too logical
2016-07-06 15:55:23	keveloper	-_-
2016-07-06 15:55:36	keveloper	i feel like we would be doing a good job at running it
2016-07-06 15:55:49	keveloper	because i don't care whether or not someone enjoyed it lol
2016-07-06 15:55:54	keveloper	as long as i enjoyed it lol
2016-07-06 15:56:09	na_th_an	I'd be sending out an agenda every tuesday morning like "This is what we're going to work on tomorrow afternoon. This is the agenda"
2016-07-06 15:56:25	keveloper	Here is the starter code if you want to take a look before you come
2016-07-06 15:56:45	na_th_an	"we will be using groovy, h2, and spring boot"
2016-07-06 15:56:47	na_th_an	boom
2016-07-06 15:56:54	na_th_an	people will be MUCH more likely to come
2016-07-06 15:57:06	na_th_an	"oh, this isn't going to be a waste of my time, cool"
2016-07-06 15:57:10	keveloper	the goal is to implement a RESTful API to do blah
2016-07-06 15:57:44	keveloper	and you will write an angular app to interact with the RESTful API via Ajax with JSON responses
2016-07-06 15:58:11	keveloper	it will interact with an H2 in memory database (not persistent)
2016-07-06 15:58:18	keveloper	beyond that everything is up to you
2016-07-06 15:58:21	keveloper	we will write for 60 minutes
2016-07-06 15:58:32	keveloper	then show each other how we implemented things/what libaries we used
2016-07-06 15:58:44	keveloper	talk about who's design we liked the best
2016-07-06 15:59:02	keveloper	also we will have cookies and popcorn
2016-07-06 15:59:08	keveloper	and drinks
2016-07-06 15:59:45	keveloper	woo i get to leave in 15
2016-07-06 16:00:02	keveloper	abby came in today and was like "woah youre here early"
2016-07-06 16:00:23	keveloper	and i was like "what? i've gotten here at 8 every day for the passed month except like 3 days"
2016-07-06 16:00:49	na_th_an	I wonder if she went home
2016-07-06 16:00:57	keveloper	lol
2016-07-06 16:01:01	keveloper	if she's on then no
2016-07-06 16:01:03	keveloper	is her laptop here tho
2016-07-06 16:01:18	na_th_an	ya her laptop is here
2016-07-06 16:01:34	keveloper	she's either fucking around in smith or gone
2016-07-06 16:08:54	keveloper	how do you change number of tasks on a page in a change request
2016-07-06 16:10:47	keveloper	halp
2016-07-06 16:14:02	na_th_an	I'm trying to find the person I emailed
2016-07-06 16:14:20	keveloper	can you just go to your sent and forward it to me
2016-07-06 16:14:49	na_th_an	well I had to find the email first

2016-07-07 13:36:43	na_th_an	although
2016-07-07 13:36:52	na_th_an	that would mean he was thinking about how late he got here
2016-07-07 13:36:55	na_th_an	and felt anxious about it
2016-07-07 13:37:01	na_th_an	and I don't think taht's ever happened to him

2016-07-08 08:42:12	na_th_an	I just can't even
2016-07-08 08:42:19	keveloper	maybe he's drinking some orange drink and not mountain dew because his relatived died of a heart attack and now he wants to stop drinking pop

2016-07-08 08:42:34	na_th_an	he drinks orange juice too sometimes
2016-07-08 08:42:40	na_th_an	which is probably worse than diet mountain dew
2016-07-08 08:42:56	keveloper	he's using binoculars to look at your screen

2016-07-08 09:16:22	na_th_an	because odds are in one data center and events are in another

2016-07-11 08:33:06	keveloper	i fixed one of the health checks
2016-07-11 08:33:08	keveloper	its very weird
2016-07-11 08:33:17	keveloper	the CI cache service was down which was why they were failling
2016-07-11 08:33:30	keveloper	except only one of the health checks was good after i started the cache service again
2016-07-11 08:33:43	na_th_an	maybe needed to bounce the other one
2016-07-11 08:33:53	keveloper	its prodcon owned
2016-07-11 08:34:07	na_th_an	yeah
2016-07-11 08:34:12	na_th_an	so you email them and be like
2016-07-11 08:34:40	na_th_an	"Yo prodcon, I did this and it fixed one of the health checks, can you try bouncing the other one to see if it clears the health check?"
2016-07-11 08:35:07	keveloper	prodcon@oclc?
2016-07-11 08:35:09	na_th_an	assuming it's safe to bounce
2016-07-11 08:35:19	na_th_an	I mean don't do it right now without talking to ppl since a tech lead is here
2016-07-11 08:35:31	na_th_an	but like, just fyi that's a thing you can do
2016-07-11 08:35:49	keveloper	ent act prime losing cache is like the least important thing ever so

2016-07-11 08:37:16	keveloper	it's supposed to have access to CI data or something

2016-07-12 08:45:20	keveloper	so
2016-07-12 08:45:26	keveloper	i've been thinking this morning
2016-07-12 08:45:31	keveloper	your gonna be like "lol smh"
2016-07-12 08:45:38	keveloper	i have a goal
2016-07-12 08:45:43	keveloper	at age 26
2016-07-12 08:45:45	na_th_an	k
2016-07-12 08:45:50	keveloper	to buy an audi a7
2016-07-12 08:45:55	keveloper	so
2016-07-12 08:45:58	na_th_an	so in 4 years?
2016-07-12 08:46:13	keveloper	4 years 10 months ish yeah
2016-07-12 08:46:14	keveloper	so
2016-07-12 08:46:25	keveloper	i figured out this morning that i can save $1k every month
2016-07-12 08:46:37	keveloper	and still have $1070 left for monthly spending
2016-07-12 08:47:03	keveloper	so every pay check for the next 4 years, I am going to move over exactly $1k to my savings, very strict, every time
2016-07-12 08:47:29	keveloper	and whatever I have left at the end of that month in spending, i will move half of that to savings
2016-07-12 08:47:32	na_th_an	have you counted interest
2016-07-12 08:47:35	keveloper	no
2016-07-12 08:47:37	na_th_an	and selling your old car
2016-07-12 08:47:39	keveloper	no
2016-07-12 08:47:41	keveloper	well yeah
2016-07-12 08:47:41	keveloper	so
2016-07-12 08:48:00	keveloper	my estimated worth of my car in 5 years from now is like $9k-$12k
2016-07-12 08:48:12	keveloper	and if I do this $1k savings thing every month
2016-07-12 08:48:21	keveloper	(I really hope I have the self control to do this)
2016-07-12 08:48:52	keveloper	That's $58,000 ish by the time i want to buy an a7
2016-07-12 08:48:58	keveloper	which obviously I won't spend all on an A7
2016-07-12 08:49:02	keveloper	(not buying new, duh)
2016-07-12 08:49:08	na_th_an	I mean if that's what you wanna do then go for it
2016-07-12 08:49:18	na_th_an	it's your $$$
2016-07-12 08:49:24	keveloper	so basically, 3 year used A7s are about $38-48k
2016-07-12 08:49:38	keveloper	so if I plan to buy a $44k A7
2016-07-12 08:49:57	keveloper	Then I can put my $10k from my car + $14k from savings into it (or more)
2016-07-12 08:50:17	keveloper	and have 44-24 = 20 and do a 5 year 20k loan for the same payment im doing now
2016-07-12 08:50:30	keveloper	(on a significantly higher salary by the time I'm 26)
2016-07-12 08:50:42	keveloper	I think I can do this :D
2016-07-12 08:50:51	keveloper	Also I want to look for a secondary income that is low stress
2016-07-12 08:51:00	keveloper	I've wanted this car since I was like 17 lol
2016-07-12 08:51:07	na_th_an	cameron that is not what "running as root" means
2016-07-12 08:51:20	keveloper	I don't think he's very good
2016-07-12 08:51:26	na_th_an	apparently not
2016-07-12 08:51:30	na_th_an	cool dude tho
2016-07-12 08:51:34	na_th_an	he's more into data shit
2016-07-12 08:51:39	na_th_an	he has a math major
2016-07-12 08:51:48	na_th_an	I think he's pretty smart just not at this obv
2016-07-12 08:51:53	keveloper	wait
2016-07-12 08:51:54	keveloper	yes it is
2016-07-12 08:52:07	keveloper	If they don't have LHR-Webapp in their code
2016-07-12 08:52:14	keveloper	then the app is deployed at /LHR-Webapp/
2016-07-12 08:52:18	keveloper	which means its not running at root
2016-07-12 08:52:29	keveloper	unless i read it wrong
2016-07-12 08:52:31	keveloper	but this though
2016-07-12 08:52:32	keveloper	"Is there a way to run a single web app as root using the Ubiquty install process?"
2016-07-12 08:52:38	na_th_an	he said AS root
2016-07-12 08:52:40	keveloper	come on cameron there obvious has to be a way
2016-07-12 08:52:48	na_th_an	"running webapp as root" reads the root user
2016-07-12 08:53:01	keveloper	I figured he meant running the app AT root
2016-07-12 08:53:14	na_th_an	reading the email it's obvious that's what he means
2016-07-12 08:53:20	keveloper	i have no idea how he managed to do that
2016-07-12 08:53:26	na_th_an	but he said as root multiple times
2016-07-12 08:53:31	na_th_an	it's a tomcat thing
2016-07-12 08:53:31	keveloper	ok i see you
2016-07-12 08:53:34	keveloper	ya lol
2016-07-12 08:54:05	keveloper	Do you think I can save $1k a month for 5 years
2016-07-12 08:54:12	na_th_an	I think it's possible
2016-07-12 08:54:12	keveloper	give me feedback on my plan
2016-07-12 08:54:14	na_th_an	idk about your life
2016-07-12 08:54:16	keveloper	lol
2016-07-12 08:54:21	keveloper	Well I did all the math and I can do it
2016-07-12 08:54:27	keveloper	I think $1070 a month is enough for expensive
2016-07-12 08:54:31	keveloper	(it better fucking be dammit kevin)
2016-07-12 08:54:34	na_th_an	I know I wouldn't be able to but that's because I don't want an audi a7
2016-07-12 08:54:55	keveloper	i'm curious about what you spend money on then lol
2016-07-12 08:55:00	keveloper	i guess a bunch of computer stuff
2016-07-12 08:55:12	keveloper	So I have like $1400 in bills a month basically
2016-07-12 08:55:12	na_th_an	food, computer shit, amazon shit
2016-07-12 08:55:23	na_th_an	I have like $1000 or so I think
2016-07-12 08:55:23	keveloper	thats leave $2100
2016-07-12 08:55:48	na_th_an	that doesn't seem right
2016-07-12 08:55:52	keveloper	what?
2016-07-12 08:55:56	na_th_an	$100
2016-07-12 08:55:58	na_th_an	$1000
2016-07-12 08:56:00	na_th_an	actually
2016-07-12 08:56:06	keveloper	what? lol
2016-07-12 08:56:36	na_th_an	I think $1000 is way high
2016-07-12 08:56:44	na_th_an	not way high
2016-07-12 08:57:00	na_th_an	okay I think $1000 is about right
2016-07-12 08:57:04	keveloper	lolol

2016-07-12 08:57:12	na_th_an	if I include my jetbrains and google music
2016-07-12 08:57:16	na_th_an	and shit
2016-07-12 08:57:25	na_th_an	and amazon
2016-07-12 08:57:28	keveloper	oh come on gerrit you knew what he meant
2016-07-12 08:57:33	keveloper	na_th_an: oh i forgot about google music
2016-07-12 08:57:38	keveloper	(oh no!)
2016-07-12 08:57:41	keveloper	i think my plan is broken now
2016-07-12 08:58:22	na_th_an	gerrit probably didn't read it
2016-07-12 08:58:34	keveloper	oops wrong chat

2016-07-12 08:58:53	na_th_an	idk man I'm sure it's possible
2016-07-12 08:59:06	na_th_an	it's not that hard to save money if you're frugal
2016-07-12 08:59:10	na_th_an	it's easy no to tho
2016-07-12 08:59:17	keveloper	but i guess a single guy (marriage wise) with no kids at 22 making $60k a year should be able to save $12000 a year
2016-07-12 08:59:25	na_th_an	I did some android shit yesterday

2016-07-12 09:08:41	na_th_an	it's gonna be free and open source
2016-07-12 09:08:42	keveloper	I might do apps as a secondary income

2016-07-12 09:09:08	na_th_an	I might try to make it so that you have to pay to use my central server if you want
2016-07-12 09:09:11	na_th_an	or you can run your own
2016-07-12 09:09:18	keveloper	ooh ya
2016-07-12 09:09:23	na_th_an	everything will be end to end encrypted

2016-07-12 09:09:39	na_th_an	huh
2016-07-12 09:09:43	keveloper	like who would understand that sentence and be like "okay here's my money"
2016-07-12 09:09:55	na_th_an	that's a marketing thing
2016-07-12 09:10:01	keveloper	true
2016-07-12 09:10:05	keveloper	call up jay
2016-07-12 09:10:07	na_th_an	99% of people would just buy the version of the app that would come with it
2016-07-12 09:10:19	na_th_an	the 1% that realize it's open source would look up instructions torun their own
2016-07-12 09:10:32	na_th_an	and also
2016-07-12 09:10:42	na_th_an	idgaf because I'd only do that to cover expenses if they got too high

2016-07-12 09:11:42	na_th_an	notifications after messageing is really good
2016-07-12 09:12:01	keveloper	see you need a product person who understands your market to give you features that are worth money

2016-07-12 14:33:40	na_th_an	all I've ever seen him do is go to meetings and be like "ya gotta test"

2016-07-12 14:48:14	na_th_an	I didn't look closely
2016-07-12 14:48:48	keveloper	i wonder why eric stopped coming to irc
2016-07-12 14:49:00	na_th_an	probably because we were tired of his shit
2016-07-12 14:49:06	na_th_an	or because he's getting here at 11 and doesn't want us to know
2016-07-12 14:49:09	na_th_an	but that would imply shame
2016-07-12 14:49:13	na_th_an	so I don't think that's the case
2016-07-12 14:49:18	na_th_an	he doesn't like that we didn't like his song

2016-07-13 10:19:59	keveloper	it was fun having to hack together xpaths to find certain elements and build page objects
2016-07-13 10:20:35	keveloper	yesterday when jeff was like
2016-07-13 10:20:45	keveloper	"i will never check jira"
2016-07-13 10:20:49	keveloper	emails
2016-07-13 10:20:58	keveloper	"i only delete jira emails"
2016-07-13 10:21:04	keveloper	as an argument against something
2016-07-13 10:21:05	keveloper	i was like
2016-07-13 10:21:11	keveloper	"that sounds like a you problem"
2016-07-13 10:21:15	na_th_an	he's not wrong
2016-07-13 10:21:23	na_th_an	jira emails and alerts are useless
2016-07-13 10:21:23	keveloper	i look at jira emails everyday
2016-07-13 10:21:35	keveloper	i just zoom through it really quickly
2016-07-13 10:21:41	keveloper	yeah except the robert torre-martin stuff?
2016-07-13 10:21:51	keveloper	that was pretty important and he found out through emails
2016-07-13 10:22:15	na_th_an	jira is a poor tool for sending a message to someone
2016-07-13 10:22:19	na_th_an	would you agree with that?
2016-07-13 10:22:43	na_th_an	and so, we probably shouldn't base a part of our process around using jira to send messages to people?
2016-07-13 10:22:59	na_th_an	there are better, more efficient ways to accomplish that
2016-07-13 10:23:17	keveloper	yeah lol
2016-07-13 10:23:32	keveloper	i wish we had a good way to get a notification about a jria comment like facebook
2016-07-13 10:23:34	keveloper	that wasn't email
2016-07-13 10:23:59	keveloper	like if im sitting in jira and someone comments on something im watching it better be like "x commented on y"
2016-07-13 10:24:04	keveloper	and why dont i have like a feed
2016-07-13 10:24:23	keveloper	like my homepage should be like "bridget dauer commented on an issue you are watching"
2016-07-13 10:24:27	keveloper	thatd be very helpful
2016-07-13 10:27:46	keveloper	got it
2016-07-13 10:27:49	keveloper	im making my own dashboard
2016-07-13 10:38:44	keveloper	woo got my activity stream
2016-07-13 10:38:53	keveloper	this is nice
2016-07-13 11:13:58	na_th_an	I was thinking
2016-07-13 11:14:02	na_th_an	that he probably has sleep apnea
2016-07-13 11:14:03	keveloper	 day 2 of 1825

2016-07-13 11:14:46	keveloper	o
2016-07-13 11:15:44	keveloper	i'd rather say 5 years than 1825 days
2016-07-13 11:18:39	keveloper	5 years ago i was going into my junior year of highschool
2016-07-13 11:18:44	keveloper	that is so weird

2016-07-13 13:03:02	na_th_an	there's no actual information there
2016-07-13 13:04:38	na_th_an	it's just a list of questions
2016-07-13 15:39:37	keveloper	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer#Attack_Decay_Sustain_Release_.28ADSR.29_envelope
2016-07-14 09:01:45	na_th_an	listening to mark eat is my favorite part of every morning
2016-07-14 09:01:51	keveloper	lol
2016-07-14 09:02:57	na_th_an	I think abby might be overreacting to what happened
2016-07-14 09:03:01	na_th_an	highway lanes are pretty big
2016-07-14 09:03:03	na_th_an	w/e tho

2016-07-14 09:05:02	na_th_an	and what keys it looks up
2016-07-14 09:05:14	na_th_an	and what key it looks up to return the current db
2016-07-14 09:05:36	keveloper	oh i see u
2016-07-14 09:05:38	keveloper	okay
2016-07-14 09:05:41	keveloper	idk why i was confused
2016-07-14 09:05:47	na_th_an	it's pretty weird code
2016-07-14 09:05:53	na_th_an	another xifeng present
2016-07-14 09:05:57	na_th_an	it's ugly and dumb
2016-07-14 09:06:06	na_th_an	and has stupid hacks for dumb shit
2016-07-14 09:06:12	na_th_an	like db long names
2016-07-14 09:06:41	keveloper	dbinfo.xwc.z-pnz.displayLongName
2016-07-14 09:07:08	na_th_an	that won't display in the "Other Databases" FRBR section
2016-07-14 09:07:10	na_th_an	I think
2016-07-14 09:07:13	na_th_an	IIRC
2016-07-14 09:07:26	na_th_an	that's another place you have to make sure the database name appears correctly
2016-07-14 09:07:49	keveloper	ugh
2016-07-14 09:07:59	na_th_an	bc we never implemented copyright statements right
2016-07-14 09:08:01	keveloper	there's a bunch of stuff defined that way
2016-07-14 09:08:13	na_th_an	yeah it should only be copyright statements I think
2016-07-14 09:08:15	na_th_an	I could be wrong
2016-07-14 09:08:17	na_th_an	or it could be wrong
2016-07-14 09:08:19	na_th_an	it's all stupid code
2016-07-14 09:08:42	keveloper	why doens't it just have the same display as the facet section like
2016-07-14 09:09:05	na_th_an	because like for Medline
2016-07-14 09:09:18	na_th_an	when you look at the record at the top it says a full copyright statement
2016-07-14 09:09:30	keveloper	o
2016-07-14 09:09:33	na_th_an	but then in the Other Databases: section if it's part of a FRBR workset it just says "Medline"
2016-07-14 09:09:43	keveloper	idk if thats the way i would have done that lol
2016-07-14 09:09:54	na_th_an	it fucking shouldn't be
2016-07-14 09:09:56	na_th_an	it's gross and awful
2016-07-14 09:09:58	keveloper	lol
2016-07-14 09:10:12	na_th_an	xifeng did disgusting things with properties files that should be illegal
2016-07-14 09:10:19	keveloper	lol

2016-07-14 09:11:02	keveloper	do you know anything about investing
2016-07-14 09:11:19	na_th_an	no
2016-07-14 09:11:20	keveloper	like when i save up $10k should I put 2 or 3k in a mutual bond or something
2016-07-14 09:11:24	na_th_an	there are some good khan academy videos
2016-07-14 09:11:28	keveloper	mutual bonds are small gains but not risky i think
2016-07-14 09:11:33	na_th_an	I know not shit about investing
2016-07-14 09:11:35	keveloper	okay lol

2016-07-14 09:11:49	keveloper	yeah lol
2016-07-14 09:11:51	keveloper	maybe idk
2016-07-14 09:12:00	na_th_an	mutual funds are managed stock portfolios
2016-07-14 09:12:15	keveloper	mutual fund is like a bunch of people pool invest in a bunch of companies and split the earnings right
2016-07-14 09:12:22	keveloper	thats why its "mutual"
2016-07-14 09:12:41	na_th_an	well you all mutually invest in a fund that is managed by an investment firm
2016-07-14 09:12:50	na_th_an	there are different kinds, like some are generalized
2016-07-14 09:12:57	na_th_an	some focus in certain industries
2016-07-14 09:13:06	na_th_an	but the firm buys/sells/trades stocks within the fund
2016-07-14 09:13:10	na_th_an	for maximum returns
2016-07-14 09:13:12	keveloper	k properties file thing worked
2016-07-14 09:13:24	na_th_an	"it doesn't work"

2016-07-14 09:13:50	na_th_an	but ya I've heard a lot of people talk about tracking a market index instead of mutual funds
2016-07-14 09:13:54	na_th_an	like the S&P
2016-07-14 09:14:01	na_th_an	/r/personalfinance is really good
2016-07-14 09:14:07	keveloper	dude oclc is a great company

2016-07-14 09:14:31	keveloper	like seriously

2016-07-14 16:19:21	na_th_an	having some debt can be healthy
2016-07-14 16:19:27	na_th_an	leasing is dumb
2016-07-14 16:19:44	keveloper	it was the cheapest way for her to get a reliable car for 3 years in college
2016-07-14 16:19:46	keveloper	it made sense
2016-07-14 16:19:46	na_th_an	I worked with a girl who leased a brand new car while she was in high school

2016-07-14 16:20:09	keveloper	in her use case it made sense I think
2016-07-14 16:20:11	na_th_an	I'd rather spend as little as possible on a beater and get it repaired than lease a car for college
2016-07-14 16:20:18	na_th_an	but OSU is a little different than capital probably
2016-07-14 16:20:21	keveloper	her dad won't buy used cars ever

2016-07-19 10:12:26	keveloper	No it doesn't
2016-07-19 10:12:30	na_th_an	yes it does
2016-07-19 10:12:34	keveloper	Having a bunch of credit cards does
2016-07-19 10:12:43	keveloper	Having a single credit card you don't use very much wont hurt you

2016-07-19 10:13:58	keveloper	One thing I've done is make a big purchase through my credit card then pay it off the same day from my checking account
2016-07-19 10:48:43	keveloper	Why did mark approve this pull requests
2016-07-19 10:48:59	na_th_an	because code review?
2016-07-19 10:49:01	na_th_an	why wouldn't he
2016-07-19 10:49:14	keveloper	because the code is wrong

2016-07-19 10:52:16	na_th_an	and he didn't see anything extra
2016-07-19 10:52:20	na_th_an	so he's like 'cool'
2016-07-19 10:52:23	na_th_an	'done'

2016-07-19 15:15:40	keveloper	maybe if you shake your laptop it will go faster
2016-07-19 15:15:45	na_th_an	hmm
2016-07-19 15:15:52	keveloper	idk what to say to jeff
2016-07-19 15:16:02	keveloper	i dont want to architect some bullshit way to get URLs right now
2016-07-19 15:16:14	keveloper	this is in all of our products
2016-07-19 15:16:21	keveloper	am i supposed to do this to all of them
2016-07-19 15:16:33	na_th_an	tell him you can't figure out how to read the URLs from the properties file because the test classes aren't instantiated by spring so they don't have any application context
2016-07-19 15:16:35	na_th_an	and see what he says
2016-07-19 15:16:49	na_th_an	"idk how to use spring to read these properties in the test classes"
2016-07-19 15:16:56	na_th_an	or
2016-07-19 15:16:59	keveloper	thats already been discussed
2016-07-19 15:17:00	keveloper	he said
2016-07-19 15:17:02	keveloper	"Another solution will be necessary, such as specifying an environment to run live integration, and using that to look up any URLs that would vary."
2016-07-19 15:17:22	na_th_an	ask if you should write a ticket for this lol
2016-07-19 15:17:31	na_th_an	"this is going to be a lot of work, should I write a ticket?"
2016-07-19 15:17:41	keveloper	lol
2016-07-19 15:17:50	na_th_an	"it probably needs to go through detailed design if we want to do this anyway"
2016-07-19 15:18:10	na_th_an	use the process we have to stop from having to do dumb work
2016-07-19 15:18:12	na_th_an	it's why it's there
2016-07-19 15:18:41	keveloper	lol
2016-07-19 15:28:56	keveloper	i cant take jeff today
2016-07-19 15:30:20	keveloper	i asked him how do a live integration test in maven
2016-07-19 15:30:22	keveloper	and he was like idk
2016-07-19 15:30:41	keveloper	so i looked at what ubi was doing
2016-07-19 15:31:01	keveloper	so i did that, then i messaged him "mvn verify -Ddc.env=dev worked for me"
2016-07-19 15:31:14	keveloper	and he replied "I'll bet you it didn't"
2016-07-19 15:31:33	keveloper	right so I'm just imagine the fact that the output says passed: 784 failed: 0 okay
2016-07-19 15:31:53	na_th_an	why does he think that didn't work...?
2016-07-19 15:32:19	keveloper	because the test reports aren't where he thought they would be
2016-07-19 15:32:42	na_th_an	neat
2016-07-19 15:32:47	keveloper	lol
2016-07-19 15:32:56	keveloper	he's been intense the passed few days
2016-07-19 15:33:04	na_th_an	past
2016-07-19 15:33:58	na_th_an	I have to make an account to use source tree?

2016-07-19 15:34:15	keveloper	idts
2016-07-19 15:34:24	na_th_an	it appears I do
2016-07-19 15:34:31	keveloper	weird
2016-07-19 15:36:40	na_th_an	lol I'm rebasing my feature branch against master so I don't clutter shit with a ton of commits
2016-07-19 15:36:50	na_th_an	I made 38 commits
2016-07-19 15:36:56	na_th_an	farted

2016-07-19 15:38:09	keveloper	lol
2016-07-19 15:39:03	keveloper	doesn't mvn test run unit tets
2016-07-19 15:39:05	keveloper	tests
2016-07-19 15:39:10	keveloper	why would that do live integration
2016-07-19 15:39:11	na_th_an	idk it should
2016-07-19 15:39:14	na_th_an	idk
2016-07-19 15:39:56	na_th_an	why does DUI still have pom.xml's
2016-07-19 15:40:07	keveloper	lol where
2016-07-19 15:40:17	na_th_an	discoveryui-application/pom.xml
2016-07-19 15:40:23	keveloper	lolol
2016-07-19 15:41:28	na_th_an	btw to squash and rebase
2016-07-19 15:41:34	na_th_an	I think you can just do "git rebase -i master"
2016-07-19 15:41:41	na_th_an	to rebase off the master branch
2016-07-19 15:41:49	keveloper	i dont remember how to squash
2016-07-19 15:42:27	na_th_an	idk stackoverflow is just telling me to rebase
2016-07-19 15:42:30	na_th_an	to get rid of my 39 commits
2016-07-19 15:42:52	keveloper	there are two discovery config live integration tests that both fail
2016-07-19 15:43:44	na_th_an	"interactive rebase in progress"
2016-07-19 15:43:48	na_th_an	I am very scared
2016-07-19 15:44:08	keveloper	and jeff wants me to architect a solution to have dynamic URLs based on environments
2016-07-19 15:44:35	keveloper	For live integration tests that only exist in CI and RV
2016-07-19 15:44:39	keveloper	and have only ever failed
2016-07-19 15:44:43	keveloper	2 of 2 tests
2016-07-19 15:45:01	keveloper	just kidding they passed in april
2016-07-19 15:45:38	keveloper	oh there used to be 3 tests... but one of them got deleted since may
2016-07-19 15:59:20	keveloper	so
2016-07-19 15:59:27	keveloper	doing spec.env=ci makes these tests pass right
2016-07-19 15:59:30	keveloper	but it should be dev
2016-07-19 15:59:36	keveloper	i have NO idea where the ci thing is
2016-07-19 15:59:42	keveloper	or where spec.env is use
2016-07-19 16:01:44	keveloper	WTF
2016-07-19 16:02:40	keveloper	There is no ci config
2016-07-19 16:03:01	keveloper	Oh no
2016-07-19 16:03:55	na_th_an	how to git
2016-07-19 16:04:01	na_th_an	I need git class
2016-07-19 16:04:08	keveloper	lol what
2016-07-19 16:04:38	na_th_an	I'm trying to squash my 38 commits
2016-07-19 16:04:45	keveloper	and
2016-07-19 16:05:00	na_th_an	failing
2016-07-19 16:05:10	keveloper	sounds right
2016-07-19 16:05:17	keveloper	i want to leave
2016-07-19 16:06:12	na_th_an	same
2016-07-19 16:06:17	keveloper	so

2016-07-19 16:07:11	keveloper	http://git.ent.oclc.org/projects/DISC/repos/discoveryconfig/browse/discoveryconfig-webapp/src/main/resources/oomRef_ci.xml#55-62
2016-07-19 16:07:15	keveloper	cachew*
2016-07-19 16:07:16	keveloper	but no

2016-07-19 16:07:52	keveloper	there's also the rv pte and prod version of those files
2016-07-19 16:08:00	keveloper	http://git.ent.oclc.org/projects/DISC/repos/discoveryconfig/browse/discoveryconfig-webapp/src/main/resources/findit_ci.props
2016-07-19 16:08:05	keveloper	there's also about 20 files like that one
2016-07-19 16:08:10	keveloper	with some random firefly url at the top
2016-07-19 16:08:18	keveloper	http://git.ent.oclc.org/projects/DISC/repos/discoveryconfig/browse/discoveryconfig-webapp/src/main/resources
2016-07-19 16:08:22	keveloper	basically all of those
2016-07-19 16:08:22	na_th_an	awesome
2016-07-19 16:08:52	keveloper	Literally what the fuck is this
2016-07-19 16:09:25	keveloper	... guess who added all these files in here
2016-07-19 16:09:39	keveloper	because this is surely the best way to do this
2016-07-19 16:10:01	keveloper	have firefly-perf.ent.oclc.org/sru in here 56 times
2016-07-19 16:10:02	keveloper	guess who
2016-07-19 16:10:04	na_th_an	Leo
2016-07-19 16:10:07	na_th_an	Xifeng
2016-07-19 16:10:08	keveloper	JB
2016-07-19 16:10:10	na_th_an	:(
2016-07-19 16:10:28	keveloper	-_-
2016-07-19 16:10:30	na_th_an	must have taken him years at the speed he types
2016-07-19 16:10:35	keveloper	lolol
2016-07-19 16:10:51	keveloper	this
2016-07-19 16:10:51	keveloper	http://firefly-perf.ent.oclc.org/firefly-service/rs/sru
2016-07-19 16:10:54	keveloper	is in the project
2016-07-19 16:10:55	keveloper	44 TIMES
2016-07-19 16:10:58	keveloper	WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK
2016-07-19 16:11:07	na_th_an	oh I think I did it
2016-07-19 16:11:08	keveloper	SERIOUSLY WHAT THE FUCK
2016-07-19 16:11:12	keveloper	you did what
2016-07-19 16:11:14	na_th_an	"This is a combination of 38 commits"
2016-07-19 16:11:18	keveloper	oh
2016-07-19 16:11:19	keveloper	i was lik
2016-07-19 16:11:25	keveloper	i swear to god if you did this
2016-07-19 16:11:30	keveloper	but yayyy squash and rebaseee
2016-07-19 16:12:35	na_th_an	\o/
2016-07-19 16:12:44	na_th_an	it was just 'git rebase -i master'
2016-07-19 16:12:57	na_th_an	then in emacs I had to go through 37 of the 38 commits and press 's' to change 'pick' to 'squash'
2016-07-19 16:15:38	keveloper	Why didn't you do this in source tree lol
2016-07-19 16:15:46	na_th_an	because I didn't want to make an atlassian account
2016-07-19 16:15:51	na_th_an	fuck that
2016-07-19 16:16:44	keveloper	boom, diving further into the problem saved me lol
2016-07-19 16:16:50	keveloper	"So maybe do this: just change that URL back to DEV, not NIT, and commit / push it.  Since we’re going to fork Discovery Config during this project anyway, there’s probably not much reason to fix 44 copies of a mistake."
2016-07-19 16:17:17	na_th_an	why not global find and replace
2016-07-19 16:17:18	na_th_an	but also 
2016-07-19 16:17:20	na_th_an	idgaf 
2016-07-19 16:17:32	keveloper	because perf was ci and rv
2016-07-19 16:17:45	keveloper	so now perf has to change to dev and nit where it needs to
2016-07-19 16:17:49	keveloper	except the nit ones can't change yet
2016-07-19 16:17:58	keveloper	because where still in phase 1 of group b/c
2016-07-19 16:18:03	keveloper	because everything sucks
2016-07-19 16:18:17	na_th_an	oh that's simple
2016-07-19 16:18:46	na_th_an	aren't you supposed to be able to point to anything right now because the load balancer's are supposed to be set up to point to the old farms?
2016-07-19 16:19:12	keveloper	i COULD go fix all of these and it wouldn't be that hard
2016-07-19 16:19:13	keveloper	just really annoying
2016-07-19 16:19:15	keveloper	and stupid
2016-07-19 16:19:25	na_th_an	so like, new-non-snowflake-lb.oclc.org points to the same old machines as old-snowflake-lb-oclc.org
2016-07-19 16:19:27	keveloper	then I would have to test it in service config
2016-07-19 16:19:43	keveloper	na_th_an its supposed to
2016-07-19 16:19:48	keveloper	but not always
2016-07-19 16:19:54	keveloper	a lot of them are messed up
2016-07-19 16:19:59	na_th_an	ya I figure you have a 1/5 chance of it actually working right
2016-07-19 16:21:06	na_th_an	I wrote a ton of code today
2016-07-19 16:21:13	na_th_an	multiple classes and tests for them
2016-07-19 16:21:46	keveloper	i did not
2016-07-19 16:21:55	keveloper	i haven't written code in quite a while
2016-07-19 16:22:00	keveloper	because i've doing stupid bullshit work
2016-07-19 16:22:03	keveloper	for like 2 months
2016-07-19 16:22:20	na_th_an	tbh I've hated this problem
2016-07-19 16:22:25	na_th_an	I've been working on it since before july 4
2016-07-19 16:22:26	na_th_an	it's been awful
2016-07-19 16:22:35	na_th_an	the circ team gave me incorrect information at first
2016-07-19 16:22:48	na_th_an	they weren't even solving the problem that the ticket was written for
2016-07-19 16:23:00	na_th_an	and it wasn't until last week that I realized that they had no idea what that ticket was even supposed to be doing
2016-07-19 16:23:20	na_th_an	and they were only looking at one part of it and the changes they were telling me to make wouldn't actually fix the problem
2016-07-19 16:23:37	na_th_an	so it was really confusing trying to figure out what to do until I realized that
2016-07-19 16:24:35	keveloper	ugh
2016-07-19 16:25:04	keveloper	"this URL will never change"
2016-07-19 16:25:35	keveloper	was the "itll never change, or maybe it will, idk" a comment
2016-07-19 16:25:42	na_th_an	lol
2016-07-19 16:25:49	na_th_an	NOW IS THE WILL
2016-07-19 16:25:51	na_th_an	IT IS NEVER
2016-07-19 16:35:23	keveloper	wait now that you did that

2016-07-20 11:07:30	keveloper	this might be the worst thing ive seen in dui lol
2016-07-20 11:07:51	na_th_an	yayyy
2016-07-20 11:08:31	keveloper	"Add to my list" occurs in here 36 times
2016-07-20 11:08:31	keveloper	wtf

2016-07-20 11:14:18	keveloper	yo where does alt text come in h ere
2016-07-20 11:14:29	keveloper	record-tools.tag line 214 in DUI
2016-07-20 11:14:40	keveloper	myListOperationText ends up being the alt text
2016-07-20 11:58:33	keveloper	so i think i found the problem now what lol
2016-07-20 11:58:50	na_th_an	in coreui?
2016-07-20 11:58:54	keveloper	yeah
2016-07-20 11:58:58	keveloper	well
2016-07-20 11:59:00	keveloper	okay im coming over again
2016-07-20 12:08:17	na_th_an	since when did public methods need javadoc
2016-07-20 12:08:35	na_th_an	been on this team over 6 months and this is the first time I've ever seen that comment
2016-07-20 12:08:54	keveloper	idfk
2016-07-20 12:08:57	keveloper	i think jeff makes shit up
2016-07-20 12:09:18	keveloper	jesus comment
2016-07-20 12:09:19	keveloper	s
2016-07-20 12:09:23	na_th_an	omg
2016-07-20 12:09:27	na_th_an	I fucking asked zach
2016-07-20 12:09:30	na_th_an	"hey this ESL is shitty"
2016-07-20 12:09:36	na_th_an	"I'm gonna make a service to modify this request"
2016-07-20 12:09:41	na_th_an	"so I don't have to change the shitty ESL much"
2016-07-20 12:09:44	na_th_an	he's like "yeah sounds good"
2016-07-20 12:10:07	na_th_an	jeff is like "this class is called ESL and the other one is called service so this doesn't work"
2016-07-20 12:10:13	na_th_an	okay let's just rename it to ESL
2016-07-20 12:10:17	na_th_an	then it can call into the SAL
2016-07-20 12:10:19	na_th_an	nothing has changed
2016-07-20 12:10:26	na_th_an	and the "architecture" is done
2016-07-20 12:10:48	keveloper	lol
2016-07-20 12:11:04	na_th_an	like
2016-07-20 12:11:07	na_th_an	services have business logic
2016-07-20 12:11:11	na_th_an	this ESL has a SHIT TON of business logic
2016-07-20 12:11:16	na_th_an	so should we just rename it to a service?
2016-07-20 12:12:04	keveloper	lol
2016-07-20 12:12:09	keveloper	you gotta move it to another folder too
2016-07-20 12:12:18	na_th_an	like jeff
2016-07-20 12:18:41	na_th_an	this is why coding anything in DUI is fucking impossible
2016-07-20 12:18:50	na_th_an	because the old code is so shitty and we have to adhere to these new standards
2016-07-20 12:18:57	na_th_an	so small changes become 95% fixing old shitty code
2016-07-20 12:19:02	na_th_an	ugh
2016-07-20 12:19:12	na_th_an	I just want to be done with this problem but NOPE
2016-07-20 12:19:27	na_th_an	I'm going to go get food
2016-07-20 13:03:03	keveloper	lol
2016-07-20 13:13:30	na_th_an	ok jeff since you asked I'll recombine these test classes into a 800 line monstrosity instead of having them logically split
2016-07-20 13:13:41	na_th_an	because increasing codenarc violation limits is the worst thing ever
2016-07-20 13:14:04	na_th_an	even though I've seen multiple people with more experience, higher grade, and higher salaries than me increase the violation limit
2016-07-20 13:14:09	na_th_an	and have it pass code review!
2016-07-20 13:14:38	keveloper	damn what the hell is going on in this review
2016-07-20 13:14:51	na_th_an	discoveryui-webapp is total shit
2016-07-20 13:14:51	keveloper	defect: nope
2016-07-20 13:14:55	keveloper	literally jeff fuck you
2016-07-20 13:14:56	na_th_an	yeah very nice
2016-07-20 13:15:15	keveloper	I literally want to comment "I've seen other devs do this probably 5 times"
2016-07-20 13:15:19	na_th_an	discoveryui-webapp is total shit and impossible to make changes to at all since we have mocking and shitty tests
2016-07-20 13:15:24	keveloper	Don't recombine
2016-07-20 13:15:28	keveloper	Get rid of 2 more
2016-07-20 13:15:30	na_th_an	no it's what he wants
2016-07-20 13:15:32	na_th_an	he's tech lead
2016-07-20 13:15:38	na_th_an	what do you mean get rid of 2 more
2016-07-20 13:15:47	na_th_an	the violations are because the test classes are too big
2016-07-20 13:15:49	keveloper	I'm sure you can find two priority 2 violations
2016-07-20 13:15:51	na_th_an	because the class it's testing is too big
2016-07-20 13:15:58	na_th_an	p2 violations are harder to fix
2016-07-20 13:16:07	keveloper	what is the violation?
2016-07-20 13:16:07	na_th_an	they require actual refactoring and code changes
2016-07-20 13:16:11	na_th_an	abcmetric
2016-07-20 13:16:13	na_th_an	i think
2016-07-20 13:16:17	keveloper	what does that mean
2016-07-20 13:16:25	na_th_an	too many lines in your class
2016-07-20 13:16:30	na_th_an	like
2016-07-20 13:16:35	na_th_an	branches, assignments, conditionals
2016-07-20 13:16:47	na_th_an	a^2+b^2+c^2
2016-07-20 13:16:49	na_th_an	then sqrt that
2016-07-20 13:16:52	na_th_an	that's the abc metric
2016-07-20 13:16:57	na_th_an	it can't be more than 10 in a method
2016-07-20 13:17:02	na_th_an	err maybe 20
2016-07-20 13:17:06	na_th_an	and 10 average in a class
2016-07-20 13:17:13	na_th_an	which basically means your methods should be 10 lines long
2016-07-20 13:17:50	na_th_an	and whenever anyone talks about these rules being off or like "maybe weshould increase them"
2016-07-20 13:17:58	na_th_an	his argument is that whatever number it's set at literally does not matter
2016-07-20 13:18:59	keveloper	dude i dont know
2016-07-20 13:20:01	na_th_an	but I get paid on tuesday
2016-07-20 13:20:07	na_th_an	and rashmi will fix it all with her rockstars
2016-07-20 13:20:26	keveloper	lol
2016-07-20 13:20:53	na_th_an	I really want to know why I get a "defect: nope" when Xifeng and others who are fucking grade 18s have increased the codenarc limit
2016-07-20 13:21:21	na_th_an	idc if we have high standards but they should be consistent or at least not higher on the lowest paid devs you have
2016-07-20 13:21:28	keveloper	because jeff is being a dick recently
2016-07-20 13:23:01	keveloper	zach would never say "Defect: nope"
2016-07-20 13:23:06	keveloper	that's like yesterday when he was like
2016-07-20 13:23:11	na_th_an	yeah
2016-07-20 13:23:12	keveloper	"i'll bet you didn't"
2016-07-20 13:23:18	na_th_an	jeff has been a dick especially this week
2016-07-20 13:23:23	keveloper	and i was like "except I did though jeff so"
2016-07-20 13:23:33	na_th_an	like "did this even build? #smh"
2016-07-20 13:23:42	na_th_an	yes jeff I fucking did a clean build before making a pull request
2016-07-20 13:23:43	keveloper	i think he was trying to be funny
2016-07-20 13:23:47	na_th_an	"my tech lead doesn't know git #smh"
2016-07-20 13:23:52	keveloper	lol
2016-07-20 13:24:03	keveloper	"do you even know when merge conflicts happen #smh"
2016-07-20 13:24:07	na_th_an	it'd be funny if there wasn't 15 other things he's complaining about
2016-07-20 13:24:29	na_th_an	and he isn't asking me to shoehorn this architecture into shitty old code
2016-07-20 13:24:39	na_th_an	in order to do it right this whole shitty class has to be rewritten
2016-07-20 13:24:46	na_th_an	it's not even in the right package
2016-07-20 13:24:50	na_th_an	err, MODULE
2016-07-20 13:24:52	na_th_an	it's in fucking webapp
2016-07-20 13:24:55	na_th_an	not the esl's
2016-07-20 13:24:57	na_th_an	gah
2016-07-20 13:25:04	na_th_an	0/10
2016-07-20 13:25:06	keveloper	yeah there's a bunch of shit in webapp that shouldnt be
2016-07-20 13:25:15	na_th_an	webapp was all of DUI at one point I think
2016-07-20 13:25:29	na_th_an	it seems to be where all the shittiest oldest code is
2016-07-20 13:25:35	keveloper	I've also never seen him do "Defect: blah blah"
2016-07-20 13:26:03	keveloper	kill dui
2016-07-20 13:26:09	keveloper	make new worldcat
2016-07-20 13:26:10	na_th_an	he has before 
2016-07-20 13:26:13	na_th_an	at least on my code reviews
2016-07-20 13:26:21	na_th_an	and at least one time he was like "wait no this is right"
2016-07-20 13:28:08	na_th_an	does your intellij keep changing gradle files
2016-07-20 13:28:57	keveloper	no
2016-07-20 13:28:59	keveloper	idk
2016-07-20 13:28:59	keveloper	npm ERR! peerinvalid The package grunt does not satisfy its siblings' peerDependencies requirements!
2016-07-20 13:29:04	keveloper	trying to build coreui
2016-07-20 13:29:38	na_th_an	yeah you might have to fix that
2016-07-20 13:29:43	na_th_an	NPM doesn't have deterministic builds
2016-07-20 13:30:00	na_th_an	a build that works today has no guarantee to work tomorrow because of the way it resolves dependencies
2016-07-20 13:30:49	keveloper	great so what do i do
2016-07-20 13:31:05	na_th_an	idk figure out what broke and fix it
2016-07-20 13:31:12	na_th_an	there's probably some packages.json
2016-07-20 13:31:19	na_th_an	and if you tweak the versions in it it'll work
2016-07-20 13:31:22	na_th_an	that'd be my guess
2016-07-20 13:31:32	na_th_an	or maybe your npm installation is broken
2016-07-20 13:31:33	na_th_an	idk
2016-07-20 13:31:36	keveloper	this is dumb
2016-07-20 13:31:40	na_th_an	yup
2016-07-20 13:31:58	na_th_an	"Use local gradle distribution" is the correct intellij settings
2016-07-20 13:31:59	na_th_an	btw
2016-07-20 13:32:07	na_th_an	or maybe not idk
2016-07-20 13:32:21	keveloper	huh
2016-07-20 13:32:37	na_th_an	whenever I build DUI it changes a bunch of gradle files
2016-07-20 13:32:39	na_th_an	so then git complains
2016-07-20 13:32:55	na_th_an	(build with intellij)
2016-07-20 13:33:06	na_th_an	I think I fixed it tho
2016-07-20 13:33:53	keveloper	ohh
2016-07-20 13:34:20	na_th_an	I recombined the files and made it harder to manage and longer and harder to grok and work with in the future
2016-07-20 13:34:36	na_th_an	but the rule violation limit is down to 613 from 618 so that's what matters right?
2016-07-20 13:36:16	keveloper	yep ur good
2016-07-20 13:36:27	na_th_an	k cool
2016-07-20 13:38:14	keveloper	new error now
2016-07-20 13:38:28	keveloper	npm ERR! Refusing to delete: /Volumes/SourceCode/coreui/core-ui-components/node_modules/.bin/grunt not in /Volumes/SourceCode/coreui/core-ui-components/node_modules/grunt-cli
2016-07-20 13:38:29	keveloper	wtf
2016-07-20 13:38:40	na_th_an	that seems mildly familiar
2016-07-20 13:39:03	keveloper	fuck couldnt figure out what to do
2016-07-20 13:39:16	na_th_an	lol
2016-07-20 13:40:19	keveloper	why is it so hard to build this
2016-07-20 13:40:56	na_th_an	bc nobody ever does and node sucks
2016-07-20 13:46:31	keveloper	can we by chance do css hacks instead of fucking with coreui lol
2016-07-20 13:48:31	keveloper	serious question
2016-07-20 13:55:23	na_th_an	I think this is a fix that should go into coreui unfortunately
2016-07-20 13:55:51	na_th_an	if you're confident the change will work you can just commit it, build CoreUI, and use the snapshot build locally
2016-07-20 13:56:06	na_th_an	then when it works release CoreUI
2016-07-20 13:56:11	na_th_an	and update the dui build.gradle
2016-07-20 13:58:06	keveloper	i can just throw this into _record-tools.scss
2016-07-20 13:58:07	keveloper	.core-button-group-stacked {
2016-07-20 13:58:07	keveloper	  .core-dropdown {
2016-07-20 13:58:07	keveloper	    width: 100% !important;
2016-07-20 13:58:07	keveloper	  }
2016-07-20 13:58:07	keveloper	}
2016-07-20 13:58:10	keveloper	and it works lol
2016-07-20 13:58:35	na_th_an	defect: nope.
2016-07-20 13:58:41	keveloper	Can't use !important

2016-07-21 13:56:19	keveloper	in css
2016-07-21 13:56:19	keveloper	.core-button, .core-dropdown
2016-07-21 13:56:21	keveloper	that is saying
2016-07-21 13:56:26	keveloper	button and also dropdown right
2016-07-21 13:56:29	na_th_an	yes
2016-07-21 13:56:34	na_th_an	I believe so
2016-07-21 14:04:36	keveloper	http://svn.dev.oclc.org/viewvc/CoreUI/trunk/core-ui-components/src/main/resources/core-ui-components/sass/buttons.sass?revision=678&view=markup
2016-07-21 14:04:43	keveloper	http://tinyurl.com/z3cxfq9
2016-07-21 14:04:50	keveloper	look at line 163 -> 171
2016-07-21 14:04:52	na_th_an	oc.lc bro
2016-07-21 14:05:00	keveloper	does that look like it should
2016-07-21 14:05:17	keveloper	is anything there like "woah that wont work"
2016-07-21 14:05:23	na_th_an	idk man
2016-07-21 14:05:27	na_th_an	looks fine
2016-07-21 14:05:42	keveloper	yeah
2016-07-21 14:05:47	na_th_an	coreui kinda sucks
2016-07-21 14:05:59	na_th_an	if you have to do like, 6 commits and 6 snapshot builds to get it right nobody will care
2016-07-21 14:06:32	keveloper	i mean im confused because that looks  correct
2016-07-21 14:07:11	na_th_an	is it not working?
2016-07-21 14:08:43	keveloper	no
2016-07-21 14:08:49	keveloper	whats > mean
2016-07-21 14:08:56	na_th_an	child I think
2016-07-21 14:09:03	na_th_an	why are you asking me what css selectors mean
2016-07-21 14:09:16	keveloper	oh
2016-07-21 14:09:28	keveloper	i googled sass > and didn't see anything
2016-07-21 14:10:05	na_th_an	sass is standard css selectors 
2016-07-21 14:10:09	na_th_an	with some syntactical sugar
2016-07-21 14:40:00	keveloper	so i was right
2016-07-21 14:40:16	keveloper	but DUI isn't using the trunk-SNAPSHOT CSS from CoreUI even though i told itttooo
2016-07-21 14:41:06	keveloper	first handful of popcorn
2016-07-21 14:41:13	keveloper	kernel chunk stuck in my teeth
2016-07-21 14:41:58	na_th_an	yeah I remember having issues with all of that
2016-07-21 14:42:37	keveloper	its because i didn't do gw clean
2016-07-21 14:44:47	keveloper	stupid popcorn
2016-07-21 15:07:32	keveloper	i've committed the same message to CoreUI 4 times
2016-07-21 15:07:39	na_th_an	lol
2016-07-21 15:07:42	na_th_an	squash and rebase bro
2016-07-21 15:07:55	keveloper	#svn
2016-07-21 15:08:00	na_th_an	i know it
2016-07-21 15:08:11	keveloper	"Fixed dropdown resizing in stacked button groups (last time)"
2016-07-21 15:08:15	keveloper	lol
2016-07-21 15:52:52	keveloper	That would be really cool if I could be like a UI specialized dev who worked with UX to do wireframes and make other UX decisions with them I think itd be fine
2016-07-21 15:58:08	keveloper	itd  be fun**
2016-07-21 15:58:23	keveloper	I think I've decided I like front end better than back end
2016-07-21 15:58:35	keveloper	At least DUI front end vs DUI back end lol
2016-07-21 15:58:36	na_th_an	I like both a good amount
2016-07-21 15:58:38	keveloper	My own back end is fine
2016-07-21 15:58:44	na_th_an	but ya DUI frontend is generally nicer
2016-07-21 15:59:00	keveloper	this was a fun ticket
2016-07-21 15:59:03	keveloper	its almost over :(
2016-07-21 15:59:14	keveloper	i have one more question for binaebi though whever she went
2016-07-21 16:03:27	keveloper	nicks not in irc anymore
2016-07-21 16:04:27	na_th_an	he is sometimes
2016-07-21 16:54:35	keveloper	jeff doesn't like this save vs saved thing obviously
2016-07-21 16:54:37	keveloper	and is like
2016-07-21 16:54:46	keveloper	"typo risk * 2"
2016-07-21 16:54:53	keveloper	but doesn't propose what he would do there
2016-07-21 16:55:14	keveloper	like what do you want "save past tense" ? lol
2016-07-21 16:57:00	keveloper	about the jsp if statement comment: honestly I saw the jsp conditional syntax and was like "wtf is that hell no" and took it from the block below it that did the same thing and didnt think about it lol
2016-07-21 16:57:34	na_th_an	code review comments aren't a big deal
2016-07-21 16:57:54	na_th_an	but ya I wish he'd focus more on what the code SHOULD be rather than what's wrong
2016-07-21 16:59:25	keveloper	i'm leavin
2016-07-21 16:59:30	keveloper	wanna leave and balc for 3 minutes

2016-07-21 17:00:15	keveloper	okay well im packin up
2016-07-22 08:41:00	na_th_an	ying commented to use "Unsave" instead of "Saved"
2016-07-22 08:41:12	na_th_an	Unsave isn't a word :/
2016-07-22 08:41:13	na_th_an	it should be
2016-07-22 08:43:19	keveloper	No that was jeff's idea
2016-07-22 08:43:35	keveloper	he doesn't like binaebi's Save and Saved
2016-07-22 08:43:40	keveloper	He wants Save and Unsave
2016-07-22 08:43:44	keveloper	which why he's not UX
2016-07-22 08:43:56	na_th_an	oh lol
2016-07-22 08:45:03	na_th_an	jeff should become a librarian
2016-07-22 08:45:08	na_th_an	so he can request all of these things
2016-07-22 08:45:12	na_th_an	and be really mad and angry about it
2016-07-22 08:45:18	na_th_an	he could be like
2016-07-22 08:45:27	na_th_an	"Refactor OWCCustomQueryFactory NOW!" 
2016-07-22 08:45:46	keveloper	what if tepuna told us to refactor OWCCustomQuery
2016-07-22 08:45:52	keveloper	and was like we are leaving if you dont do this
2016-07-22 08:45:54	na_th_an	how can we make that happen
2016-07-22 08:46:12	keveloper	write a letter to tepuna lol
2016-07-22 08:46:18	keveloper	"All of our bugs come from this one class"
2016-07-22 08:46:31	keveloper	"but the company won't prioritize refactoring it"
2016-07-22 08:46:31	keveloper	lol
2016-07-22 08:47:26	na_th_an	"also btw rewrite DR"
2016-07-22 09:16:36	keveloper	"I am teaching him drivinig car" lol

2016-07-22 09:21:41	keveloper	lol
2016-07-22 09:21:49	keveloper	i bet
2016-07-22 09:22:03	keveloper	i wonder if when his kids get in trouble he's like
2016-07-22 09:22:06	keveloper	"defect: nope"
2016-07-22 09:22:10	na_th_an	lol

2016-07-22 13:48:06	keveloper	yeah
2016-07-22 13:48:32	keveloper	either she's embarassed to have something on her home screen she doesn't use because there aren't matching icons for the apps she wants there
2016-07-22 13:48:37	keveloper	or she's secretly religious lol
2016-07-22 13:51:21	na_th_an	idk I thought one of the things she said to me about stephen was that he was too religious but maybe not

2016-07-22 13:54:52	na_th_an	I don't know anyone that has converted to any religion
2016-07-22 13:55:01	na_th_an	just people that have gone away
2016-07-22 13:55:10	keveloper	marisa's dad
2016-07-22 13:55:11	keveloper	my ex
2016-07-22 13:55:17	keveloper	he was an athiest until college
2016-07-22 13:55:30	keveloper	then someone knocked on his dorm room door and was like "can i tell you about jesus"
2016-07-22 13:55:34	keveloper	honestly i dont think thats true
2016-07-22 13:55:42	keveloper	i think he's deep in a lie to get with her mom lol
2016-07-22 13:55:49	na_th_an	I had one guy in college try to convert me
2016-07-22 13:55:52	keveloper	met her on a missions trip
2016-07-22 13:55:54	keveloper	ya me too
2016-07-22 13:55:56	keveloper	like twice
2016-07-22 13:55:59	keveloper	it was annyoing
2016-07-22 13:56:00	na_th_an	I was having a really shitty day and a dude talked to me and got my number
2016-07-22 13:56:09	na_th_an	I did meet with him for food like once or twice and talked to him
2016-07-22 13:56:19	na_th_an	and frankly it just made me more rooted in atheism
2016-07-22 13:56:26	keveloper	yeah
2016-07-22 13:56:27	keveloper	so
2016-07-22 13:56:30	na_th_an	to hear the same crappy non-scientific non-arguments that I heard when I was growing up in church
2016-07-22 13:56:46	keveloper	i get that some people might be doing it to help people ya know
2016-07-22 13:56:57	keveloper	like they legitimately want others to go to heaven or whatever
2016-07-22 13:56:59	na_th_an	ya it's interesting having grown up in the church and seeing where they're coming from
2016-07-22 13:57:03	na_th_an	they do want to do good
2016-07-22 13:57:21	keveloper	but i think its more likely they are doing that to have a good conscious
2016-07-22 13:57:30	keveloper	because as a christian you are also supposed to spread it
2016-07-22 13:57:37	keveloper	spread the word of jesus
2016-07-22 13:57:45	na_th_an	they push it really hard in church
2016-07-22 13:57:57	na_th_an	the more I think back to church the more I notice the cult-like tendancies
2016-07-22 13:58:03	keveloper	(which is a suspiscouly convenient mechanism for spreading something that was used for power)
2016-07-22 13:58:40	na_th_an	I'm really disenthused by religion as well
2016-07-22 13:58:48	na_th_an	like there's some ppl from my old church that are missionaries
2016-07-22 13:58:57	na_th_an	and they have 4 kids and are doing mission work in the Sudan
2016-07-22 13:59:10	na_th_an	there's no way in hell those kids are getting a good education or a rounded world view 
2016-07-22 13:59:21	keveloper	spreading all of the jesus everywhere tho
2016-07-22 13:59:26	na_th_an	and my church pays for them to go there
2016-07-22 13:59:36	na_th_an	people from my church go on mission trips to feel good about themselves
2016-07-22 13:59:44	na_th_an	you'll do a lot more good by just sending that money to established aid groups
2016-07-22 13:59:55	keveloper	emily tried to tell me missions trips aren't about spreading christianity
2016-07-22 13:59:56	na_th_an	but that doesn't give you the same self-satisfaction and team building with other church goers
2016-07-22 14:00:03	keveloper	and i was like "that is LITERALLY the point of them"
2016-07-22 14:00:11	na_th_an	well there's two types of mission trips
2016-07-22 14:00:21	na_th_an	there's the "I'm moving to Sudan on a mission trip for the next 8 months"
2016-07-22 14:00:29	na_th_an	and there's "I'm going to haiti for a week over the summer to build a house"
2016-07-22 14:00:45	na_th_an	the 2nd kind exists 100% for money and making teenagers feel good about religion
2016-07-22 14:01:19	keveloper	you dont think in that 2nd one after they are done building the house they are like "hey let me tell you about jesus"
2016-07-22 14:01:25	na_th_an	well yeah they are
2016-07-22 14:01:32	keveloper	"do you know why im here? because jesus told me to come here. do you know about jesus?"
2016-07-22 14:01:38	na_th_an	they still do religous things
2016-07-22 14:01:43	na_th_an	but at the end of the day they exist to make money
2016-07-22 14:02:03	keveloper	then these 3rd world kids are hearing 1st world people who they think know everything because all of their technology and health and they come here and tell them about jesus so it must be true
2016-07-22 14:02:03	na_th_an	if the goal was to create the most good for the people who need help with the available resources, sending teenagers to haiti is NOT a good way to spend the money
2016-07-22 14:02:18	keveloper	why would these 1st world people who travel the world be wrong about religion
2016-07-22 14:02:21	keveloper	kind of thing
2016-07-22 14:02:38	na_th_an	it's probably more of a "I'll say anything they want to get what they have"
2016-07-22 14:02:48	keveloper	also torue
2016-07-22 14:02:58	keveloper	"yeah i believe in jesus if you come build me a school"
2016-07-22 14:05:14	na_th_an	church politics is also really gross
2016-07-22 14:05:37	na_th_an	I've seen so many people who were friendly and nice to each other's faces every sunday suddenly leave due to politics
2016-07-22 14:05:54	na_th_an	people aren't willing to say anything mean or negative to anyone's face so they work behind people's backs
2016-07-22 14:06:05	na_th_an	church politics are awful
2016-07-22 14:06:15	keveloper	like what would be going on behind backs lol
2016-07-22 14:06:20	na_th_an	and it only takes one family being an asshole to ruin it for everyone
2016-07-22 14:06:29	na_th_an	like, my mom used to be a secretary at our church
2016-07-22 14:06:42	na_th_an	and the church president wanted her gone because he thought they could get cheaper labor
2016-07-22 14:06:51	na_th_an	so they gave our pastor a bonus 
2016-07-22 14:06:57	na_th_an	then gave her a very positive perfomance review
2016-07-22 14:07:03	na_th_an	and said "you're getting a pay cut"
2016-07-22 14:07:18	na_th_an	after she had worked there for over a decade
2016-07-22 14:07:46	na_th_an	this was all done under the table
2016-07-22 14:07:54	na_th_an	nobody would talk to her about any of it when she tried to
2016-07-22 14:07:59	keveloper	i dont believe you
2016-07-22 14:08:00	na_th_an	people suddenly stopped making eye contact with her
2016-07-22 14:08:02	keveloper	christians are good people
2016-07-22 14:08:06	na_th_an	they don't go to the church any more
2016-07-22 14:08:19	na_th_an	one of the families who had kids I was friends with left for similar reasons when I was younger
2016-07-22 14:08:31	na_th_an	their dad was church president and ended up leaving beacuse of some dumb politics
2016-07-22 14:08:35	keveloper	church is dumb
2016-07-22 14:08:37	na_th_an	i was pretty young so I have no idea what it was
2016-07-22 14:08:59	na_th_an	and now anyone I have on facebook from that church spouts the most racist, hateful republican shit ever
2016-07-22 14:09:08	na_th_an	the furthest from "what would jesus do" or "love your neighbor" as you get
2016-07-22 14:09:22	na_th_an	then go to church every sunday and talk about how people just need to love each other and god more 
2016-07-22 14:09:42	na_th_an	my church experience was very bad and I'm bitter about it
2016-07-22 14:09:48	na_th_an	I did 2 years of confirmation it sucked
2016-07-22 14:09:54	keveloper	that sounds pretty accurate though
2016-07-22 14:10:07	keveloper	so
2016-07-22 14:10:10	na_th_an	there are probably some good churches out there but w/e
2016-07-22 14:10:11	keveloper	emily is "catholic"
2016-07-22 14:10:19	keveloper	so you know like "catholic" hasnt been to church in 3 years
2016-07-22 14:10:23	na_th_an	yeah
2016-07-22 14:10:25	na_th_an	culturally catholic
2016-07-22 14:10:25	keveloper	might go for christmas one time every 4 years
2016-07-22 14:10:27	na_th_an	it's a thing
2016-07-22 14:10:28	keveloper	yeah
2016-07-22 14:10:44	keveloper	but anyway so she doesn't care about it at all really
2016-07-22 14:10:59	keveloper	but what i was wondering is
2016-07-22 14:11:12	keveloper	if we had a kid, would she want the kid to go to church
2016-07-22 14:11:19	keveloper	i feel like thats a year
2016-07-22 14:11:20	keveloper	yes*
2016-07-22 14:11:27	keveloper	and if that's a yes
2016-07-22 14:11:41	keveloper	that basically means i need an athiest girlfriend....
2016-07-22 14:11:55	keveloper	because no way in hell i'm going to church for 13 years or whatever
2016-07-22 14:11:59	na_th_an	lol
2016-07-22 14:12:12	keveloper	and also i dont really want my kid going to church lol
2016-07-22 14:12:15	na_th_an	you could be one of those dads that stays home while your wife takes your kids
2016-07-22 14:12:23	na_th_an	I don't think exposing kids to church is bad
2016-07-22 14:12:33	na_th_an	as long as they're taught that they can choose what to believe
2016-07-22 14:12:33	keveloper	i guess so
2016-07-22 14:12:40	na_th_an	I was raised as "THIS IS TRUE 100% OR YOU BURN IN HELL"
2016-07-22 14:12:40	keveloper	yeah but still
2016-07-22 14:12:52	keveloper	yeah see i dont want my kid to be influenced by that
2016-07-22 14:12:56	na_th_an	I honestly think it's kinda good to expose kids to some religion
2016-07-22 14:13:11	keveloper	yeah i was exposed to a small amount of religion and that was enough for me
2016-07-22 14:13:35	na_th_an	like taking a kid to a bunch of churches would be a great thing I think
2016-07-22 14:27:06	keveloper	keveloper to the rescue
2016-07-22 14:27:14	keveloper	okay thats enough work for the afternoon

2016-07-27 13:00:39	na_th_an	besides school

2016-07-27 13:00:58	na_th_an	but OSU is full of fuckers that can't code at all
2016-07-27 13:01:00	na_th_an	it's pretty bad
2016-07-27 13:01:17	keveloper	lol
2016-07-27 13:01:33	keveloper	I haven't done like any coding on discovery
2016-07-27 13:02:39	na_th_an	I am ultra chill rn
2016-07-27 13:02:44	keveloper	stand

2016-07-27 13:44:50	keveloper	56 failures
2016-07-27 14:08:35	keveloper	im listening to you explain things to ying
2016-07-27 14:54:28	na_th_an	the worst part is just like
2016-07-27 14:54:32	na_th_an	"try a git pull"
2016-07-27 14:54:39	na_th_an	then there's 2 minutes of explanation 
2016-07-27 14:54:42	na_th_an	some confusion
2016-07-27 14:54:47	na_th_an	her explaining the problem again
2016-07-27 14:55:00	na_th_an	just to get her to type "git pull" and press enter
2016-07-27 14:55:05	na_th_an	and nobody has their fucking terminal set up right
2016-07-27 14:55:06	keveloper	lol
2016-07-27 14:55:07	na_th_an	holy shit
2016-07-27 14:55:09	na_th_an	how are we developers
2016-07-27 14:55:13	na_th_an	and we don't know how to use less
2016-07-27 14:55:14	na_th_an	how the fuck
2016-07-27 14:55:22	na_th_an	are you a developer for multiple years
2016-07-27 14:55:24	keveloper	did you ask her to less some file
2016-07-27 14:55:25	na_th_an	and you don't know how to use less
2016-07-27 14:55:32	na_th_an	git log
2016-07-27 14:55:37	na_th_an	she didn't know how to do it from intellij
2016-07-27 14:55:43	na_th_an	and kept scrolling with the mouse
2016-07-27 14:55:44	na_th_an	and it didn't work
2016-07-27 14:55:47	na_th_an	because her terminal is fucked
2016-07-27 14:55:52	na_th_an	and doesn't work 
2016-07-27 14:55:59	keveloper	huh
2016-07-27 14:56:06	keveloper	and she opens a tiny window the middle of the screen
2016-07-27 14:56:08	na_th_an	it was printing control characters instead of colorizing the output in the diff
2016-07-27 14:56:15	keveloper	lol
2016-07-27 14:56:22	na_th_an	page up and page down go to the terminal, not the app running in the terminal
2016-07-27 14:56:26	na_th_an	it's just fucked
2016-07-27 14:56:28	na_th_an	it's totally fucked
2016-07-27 14:56:51	na_th_an	there's no reason I should feel like I need to teach my coworkers how to use the command line
2016-07-27 14:56:54	na_th_an	or type at more than 10 wps
2016-07-27 14:56:56	na_th_an	wpm*
2016-07-27 14:57:01	na_th_an	it just amazes me
2016-07-27 14:57:07	na_th_an	I don't think I'm that good of a coder
2016-07-27 14:57:07	keveloper	yep
2016-07-27 14:57:08	na_th_an	I reall ydon't
2016-07-27 14:57:13	na_th_an	I don't tihnk I'm that smart
2016-07-27 14:57:19	keveloper	all devs shoul dbe tested on CLI skills before being hired
2016-07-27 14:57:20	na_th_an	but maybe the fact that I care at all and find it interesting means I am
2016-07-27 14:57:21	na_th_an	because holy shit
2016-07-27 14:57:38	na_th_an	interview question: "what are some of your favorite tools for coding"
2016-07-27 14:57:44	na_th_an	"vim or emacs, why?"
2016-07-27 14:57:50	na_th_an	it doesn't even matter what they choose
2016-07-27 14:57:54	na_th_an	as long as they can answer intelligently
2016-07-27 14:58:06	keveloper	lol
2016-07-27 14:58:07	keveloper	i mean
2016-07-27 14:58:22	na_th_an	"I don't like hjkl" YOU'RE HIRED
2016-07-27 14:58:33	na_th_an	"I don't like memorizing ctrl and meta bindings" YOU'RE HIRED
2016-07-27 14:58:35	keveloper	my answer was vim because thats what I learned first, and I like the vim bindings
2016-07-27 14:58:49	keveloper	From the small amount of time i spent learning emacs i didnt love the bindings
2016-07-27 14:58:58	na_th_an	emacs has a steeper learning curve i think
2016-07-27 14:59:00	na_th_an	but that's not important
2016-07-27 14:59:07	na_th_an	the important thing is that you use one and can say something about it
2016-07-27 14:59:07	keveloper	i mean my answer isn't "intelligent"
2016-07-27 14:59:10	na_th_an	maybe name a couple shortcuts
2016-07-27 14:59:19	keveloper	:w :q :x :stop
2016-07-27 14:59:20	na_th_an	it's more intelligent than "I use neither"
2016-07-27 14:59:20	keveloper	all you need
2016-07-27 14:59:25	na_th_an	or
2016-07-27 14:59:30	na_th_an	"uhh I know how to :wq"
2016-07-27 14:59:30	keveloper	I made my on .vimrc to be fucking sweet
2016-07-27 14:59:36	keveloper	lol
2016-07-27 14:59:38	keveloper	i mean
2016-07-27 14:59:43	keveloper	:%s/blkah/blah
2016-07-27 14:59:44	keveloper	etc
2016-07-27 14:59:51	keveloper	I guess I knew quite a bit
2016-07-27 15:00:00	keveloper	:15 to go to line 15
2016-07-27 15:00:10	keveloper	typing "15 [down]" goes down 15 lines
2016-07-27 15:35:40	na_th_an	ok also
2016-07-27 15:35:50	na_th_an	her music thing in her dock kept bouncing
2016-07-27 15:35:52	na_th_an	constantly
2016-07-27 15:36:03	na_th_an	a notification is in her dock saying she has over 4000 unread emails
2016-07-27 15:36:07	na_th_an	there are like 15 things down there
2016-07-27 15:36:13	na_th_an	it was incredibly distracting
2016-07-27 15:37:47	keveloper	eho

2016-07-27 15:39:53	na_th_an	that's no small task
2016-07-27 15:39:59	keveloper	its very dumb
2016-07-27 15:40:15	keveloper	I still have to fix all of the unit test
2016-07-27 15:40:16	keveloper	s
2016-07-27 15:40:27	keveloper	Figure out how to make them pass or if they can pass
2016-07-27 15:40:39	keveloper	Then get the release and publishing plugins working correctly
2016-07-27 15:40:51	keveloper	And I have no idea how to verify that with this ancient technology lol
2016-07-27 15:41:40	keveloper	its not even in archiva
2016-07-27 15:41:44	keveloper	it has never been published
2016-07-27 15:41:45	na_th_an	this should have taken 5 minutes
2016-07-27 15:41:53	keveloper	did you figure it out
2016-07-27 15:41:57	na_th_an	no

2016-07-27 15:44:01	na_th_an	one inside the other
2016-07-27 15:44:07	na_th_an	and the outer one is creating whitespace
2016-07-27 15:44:09	na_th_an	this makes no sense
2016-07-27 15:44:58	na_th_an	why the hell am I a new software dev on end user services
2016-07-27 15:45:13	na_th_an	and there's nobody that I can go to that knows CSS really well

2016-07-28 09:11:37	na_th_an	more normal for girls and ppl with family out of state
2016-07-28 09:11:37	keveloper	she'd be saving 400
2016-07-28 09:11:39	keveloper	and she said no
2016-07-28 09:11:48	keveloper	she thinks i am unable to move her large stuff
2016-07-28 09:11:49	na_th_an	she doesn't even have to store it overnight anay more

2016-07-28 09:12:11	keveloper	i know
2016-07-28 09:12:17	keveloper	idk why she thinks im not strong enough to move shit
2016-07-28 09:12:28	na_th_an	you don't even have to be strong most of the time
2016-07-28 09:12:33	keveloper	probably because she has no sense of the weight of things or something idk
2016-07-28 09:12:34	keveloper	yeah
2016-07-28 09:12:43	na_th_an	it's abby
2016-07-28 09:12:44	na_th_an	who knows

2016-07-28 09:13:36	na_th_an	my dad has an F-150
2016-07-28 09:13:45	keveloper	there we go
2016-07-28 09:13:46	na_th_an	6 foot bed
2016-07-28 09:13:48	na_th_an	boom
2016-07-28 09:13:54	na_th_an	maybe 7 actually
2016-07-28 09:13:59	na_th_an	ya 7
2016-07-28 09:14:01	keveloper	but she'd rather pay movers $850 plus tip
2016-07-28 09:14:05	na_th_an	ya idk
2016-07-28 09:14:10	na_th_an	she's paying a lot I think
2016-07-28 09:14:26	keveloper	i mean its two men and a truck
2016-07-28 09:14:35	keveloper	so the money goes to the company
2016-07-28 09:14:47	keveloper	they have $10,000 coverage if they break something
2016-07-28 09:14:58	keveloper	and she was like "can you give me $10,000 coverage if you break something"
2016-07-28 09:15:19	keveloper	and i was like "no but im not going to break anything let alone $10,000 worth of your things"
2016-07-28 09:15:39	na_th_an	lol
2016-07-28 09:15:50	na_th_an	yeah what does she have that's worth a lot and easily breakable
2016-07-28 09:15:58	keveloper	i doubt anything
2016-07-28 09:16:08	na_th_an	she just wants to be lazy idk
2016-07-28 09:16:12	keveloper	yeah
2016-07-28 09:16:27	keveloper	i think she is way overestimating how difficult moving is
2016-07-28 09:16:57	na_th_an	I don't think she ever really exercises so maybe it would be for her
2016-07-28 09:18:34	keveloper	yeah probably
2016-07-28 09:19:33	keveloper	new doctor strange trailer is fuckin sweet
2016-07-28 09:20:10	keveloper	but i cant say that too abby because she'll get offended that they "whitewashed" it
2016-07-28 09:20:50	na_th_an	lol
2016-07-28 09:20:59	keveloper	that makes me so mad
2016-07-28 09:21:49	keveloper	1) ITS MARVEL, its literally INCORRECT to accuse marvel of whitewashing, they have the most diverse characters of like any series
2016-07-28 09:22:34	keveloper	2) No way in hell they were like "oh lets only try to cast white people for this obviously asian role where ALL martial arts teacher roles have been asian in HOLLYWOOD before this
2016-07-28 09:23:18	keveloper	3) It's less racist to pick a white actress because they liked her acting better than an asian person who they didn't pick.
2016-07-28 09:23:33	keveloper	They wouldn't pick the asian actress who the like less JUST because she is asian
2016-07-28 09:23:35	keveloper	they should not do that
2016-07-28 09:23:49	na_th_an	but you see
2016-07-28 09:23:55	na_th_an	it's impossible to be racist against white people
2016-07-28 09:23:57	na_th_an	so that's not true
2016-07-28 09:24:01	keveloper	4) Notice all of the other asian people in the trailer? Oh no? You just read a a post on tumblr and got pissed about that one character?
2016-07-28 09:24:35	keveloper	Like wouldn't they also get mad about type casting and ASIAN person into a MARTIAL ARTS TEACHER ROLE liek WTF
2016-07-28 09:24:38	na_th_an	no dude abby is an expert in racial diversity
2016-07-28 09:24:42	na_th_an	and equality
2016-07-28 09:24:51	keveloper	and i go back to ITS MARVEL
2016-07-28 09:24:54	keveloper	like seriously
2016-07-28 09:24:54	na_th_an	that's why she does all these really successful programs to get girls to code
2016-07-28 09:25:12	na_th_an	purposely excluding half of the population
2016-07-28 09:25:13	keveloper	if you know anything about marvel you know that their characters are INCREDIBLY diverse
2016-07-28 09:25:22	keveloper	lol
2016-07-28 09:25:31	keveloper	that doesn't bother me as much but
2016-07-28 09:25:41	na_th_an	it doesn't bother me that much either
2016-07-28 09:25:53	na_th_an	but she's done two or there of them and she can never get any interest
2016-07-28 09:26:03	na_th_an	it might just be because girls aren't that interested in computers
2016-07-28 09:26:06	keveloper	probably because there are way less women in the field
2016-07-28 09:26:07	keveloper	yeah
2016-07-28 09:26:14	na_th_an	this is like, 10-12 year olds
2016-07-28 09:26:17	keveloper	men and women are naturally pushed to other things
2016-07-28 09:26:18	keveloper	oh yeah
2016-07-28 09:26:20	na_th_an	no dude
2016-07-28 09:26:25	keveloper	SOCIETY IS DOING It
2016-07-28 09:26:31	na_th_an	it's sexist to believe that there are biological differences in men and women
2016-07-28 09:26:38	na_th_an	and that their brains are not exactly the same
2016-07-28 09:27:11	keveloper	men definitely don't have way more testosterone which causes them to have more masucline features and be considered more "manly"
2016-07-28 09:27:18	keveloper	and women are told be society not to be manly
2016-07-28 09:27:19	na_th_an	nope
2016-07-28 09:27:27	keveloper	its not the lack of a ton of testosterone
2016-07-28 09:27:57	na_th_an	I fucked up shaving this morning
2016-07-28 09:28:00	keveloper	ow

2016-07-28 11:37:27	keveloper	huh
2016-07-28 11:37:29	na_th_an	Like when Abby asked Zach if he wants to go to Jason's!

2016-07-28 12:30:59	keveloper	like why does she talk like that

2016-07-28 12:31:12	keveloper	"are you engaged?"
2016-07-28 12:31:13	na_th_an	and explaining how their service is impacting our users
2016-07-28 12:31:22	na_th_an	and asking what their plan of action is

2016-07-28 14:52:40	keveloper	why did you ever work here?

2016-07-28 14:53:53	na_th_an	I was gonna tell you

2016-07-28 14:54:04	na_th_an	without even looking
2016-07-28 14:54:12	keveloper	lol
2016-07-28 14:54:20	keveloper	johnathon oops
2016-07-28 14:54:22	na_th_an	dude was a fucking idiot
2016-07-28 14:54:25	na_th_an	apparently
2016-07-28 15:13:20	keveloper	i just heard "decodes the SAML document" and had a stroke
2016-07-28 15:20:59	keveloper	so
2016-07-28 15:21:22	keveloper	claudia just said "i dont like cars, cars are dumb"
2016-07-28 15:21:25	keveloper	then said "ineffient/expensive/ugly/unsustainalble"
2016-07-28 15:31:48	na_th_an	she's not wrong about any of that
2016-07-28 15:32:03	keveloper	inefficient?
2016-07-28 15:32:11	na_th_an	yes
2016-07-28 15:32:16	keveloper	how so
2016-07-28 15:32:19	na_th_an	traffic
2016-07-28 15:32:25	keveloper	thats not what shes talking about
2016-07-28 15:32:26	na_th_an	1 car is a ton of space for 1 person
2016-07-28 15:32:38	na_th_an	much less emissions with public transportation
2016-07-28 15:33:00	na_th_an	roads take up a lot of space so that we can fit enough cars 
2016-07-28 15:33:09	keveloper	so you want to get from here to pickerington
2016-07-28 15:33:10	na_th_an	we don't have cars for efficiency, we have them for convienience
2016-07-28 15:33:13	keveloper	whats the most effecient way to do that
2016-07-28 15:33:26	na_th_an	depends on how you measure efficiency
2016-07-28 15:33:34	keveloper	"achieving maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense."
2016-07-28 15:33:42	na_th_an	a motorcycle would be much more efficient
2016-07-28 15:33:49	keveloper	fair
2016-07-28 15:34:00	na_th_an	a bus with 30 other people who want to go to pickerington would use less resources
2016-07-28 15:34:03	na_th_an	take up less space
2016-07-28 15:34:07	keveloper	you have 4 people
2016-07-28 15:34:15	na_th_an	if you had 3000 people who wanted to go to pickerington at the same time
2016-07-28 15:34:19	na_th_an	cars are not an efficient way to do that
2016-07-28 15:34:26	keveloper	fair
2016-07-28 15:34:30	na_th_an	cars are convienient
2016-07-28 15:34:34	keveloper	but if you had 3 people who wanted to go to pickerington
2016-07-28 15:34:40	keveloper	a bus is not an efficient way to do that
2016-07-28 15:34:51	keveloper	saying "cars are not effecient" is completely wrong
2016-07-28 15:35:02	keveloper	in some cases cars are effecient
2016-07-28 15:35:02	na_th_an	ehhh
2016-07-28 15:35:08	keveloper	in some cases they are ineffecient
2016-07-28 15:35:14	keveloper	ins ome cases busses are ineffecient
2016-07-28 15:35:23	keveloper	in some cases planes are ineffecient
2016-07-28 15:35:26	na_th_an	it's spelled with an i
2016-07-28 15:35:28	na_th_an	not an e
2016-07-28 15:35:30	na_th_an	inefficient
2016-07-28 15:35:35	keveloper	lol
2016-07-28 15:35:41	na_th_an	it's true that they're efficient sometimes
2016-07-28 15:35:54	na_th_an	but in general, cars are more for convienience than efficiency
2016-07-28 15:36:13	keveloper	and also sometimes you need to get somewhere in less than an hour..
2016-07-28 15:36:14	na_th_an	I'm gonna go balc for a sec
2016-07-28 15:36:19	keveloper	k i'll come

2016-07-29 15:58:56	na_th_an	ya it's pretty good I think
2016-07-29 15:59:01	na_th_an	especially now bc it has sprint and t-mobile
2016-07-29 15:59:03	na_th_an	plus wifi
2016-07-29 15:59:12	keveloper	https://fi.google.com/coverage
2016-07-29 15:59:16	na_th_an	I doubt you'll run into issues with it
2016-07-29 15:59:24	na_th_an	unless you drive cross country or something
2016-07-29 15:59:30	keveloper	Is it only US

2016-07-29 16:00:18	keveloper	no verizon has coverage there
2016-07-29 16:00:19	na_th_an	but bc the EU doesn't have totally fucked cellular markets

2016-07-29 16:00:54	na_th_an	I don't think you'd be able to use a US verizon phone and plan there without paying extra
2016-07-29 16:01:00	keveloper	you right
2016-07-29 16:01:01	na_th_an	it might work but you'd be paying out your ass

2016-07-29 16:01:04	keveloper	yeah
2016-07-29 16:01:16	na_th_an	but yeah it's not much to use a sim card
2016-07-29 16:01:21	na_th_an	since your phone supports it

2016-07-29 16:25:08	na_th_an	I really don't think you'd have that much trouble
2016-07-29 16:25:25	na_th_an	linux isn't incredibly difficult
2016-07-29 16:25:26	keveloper	but then there's the age old "there isnt a driver for the speakers so i cant listen to music"
2016-07-29 16:25:29	keveloper	also you are dual booted
2016-07-29 16:25:36	na_th_an	huh
2016-07-29 16:25:40	na_th_an	are you complaining about drivers on linux
2016-07-29 16:25:42	keveloper	are you not dual booted
2016-07-29 16:25:49	na_th_an	because linux supports more devices out of the box than any OS ever
2016-07-29 16:25:57	keveloper	no there's just shit liek
2016-07-29 16:25:59	na_th_an	you will never have to go hunt down a driver on linux
2016-07-29 16:26:06	keveloper	not every laptop fully supports all linux systems
2016-07-29 16:26:07	na_th_an	it's just in the kernel
2016-07-29 16:26:11	keveloper	so some weird shit wont work
2016-07-29 16:26:12	keveloper	like
2016-07-29 16:26:14	keveloper	speakers
2016-07-29 16:26:16	na_th_an	any laptop that was made in the last year will work fine
2016-07-29 16:26:20	keveloper	or backlit keyboard

2016-07-29 16:26:29	keveloper	havent you had issues with your new laptop
2016-07-29 16:26:33	na_th_an	my laptop was released earlier this year
2016-07-29 16:26:40	na_th_an	and it worked fine when I got it 
2016-07-29 16:26:51	na_th_an	literally the only thing not supported is the screen brightness function keys
2016-07-29 16:26:55	keveloper	i thought some of your hardware didnt work
2016-07-29 16:26:57	keveloper	oh
2016-07-29 16:26:58	na_th_an	and I literally mean the keys, not the screen brightness

2016-07-29 16:27:39	keveloper	i havent fully grasped any linux package managers
2016-07-29 16:27:42	na_th_an	imagine if brew controlled everything on your computer

2016-08-01 11:05:16	keveloper	like you guys are fucking ridiculous lol
2016-08-01 11:05:33	na_th_an	ya ppl are pretty dumb about it
2016-08-01 11:05:46	na_th_an	it's something you should be aware of
2016-08-01 11:05:51	na_th_an	like don't walk around at night with headphones in
2016-08-01 11:05:55	keveloper	yeah
2016-08-01 11:05:57	na_th_an	shit like that

2016-08-01 11:06:13	keveloper	i mean i wouldnt go walking around in some of those places alone at night honestly
2016-08-01 11:06:17	na_th_an	but ya I think jb's wife is kinda irrational about some shit like that
2016-08-01 11:06:19	na_th_an	well ya obviously
2016-08-01 11:06:35	keveloper	i'll drive through but not walk through
2016-08-01 11:06:41	na_th_an	they were about to move to one of the carolina's before and she got really freaked out because of some thing that happened
2016-08-01 11:06:49	na_th_an	with a black guy being shot by police or something
2016-08-01 11:06:51	na_th_an	and she got really scared
2016-08-01 11:06:56	na_th_an	so they didn't move
2016-08-01 11:06:57	keveloper	their kid is 2 years old
2016-08-01 11:07:09	na_th_an	ya not rational like I said :p
2016-08-01 11:07:23	keveloper	but i dont think dublin is a bad place to raise a black kid
2016-08-01 11:07:27	keveloper	i was confused about that
2016-08-01 11:07:30	na_th_an	ya idk
2016-08-01 11:07:31	keveloper	but apparently jb thinks it is
2016-08-01 11:07:50	keveloper	i know a bunch of black people from hilliard and dublin and none of them have had a hard time
2016-08-01 11:07:51	keveloper	that i know of
2016-08-01 11:07:58	keveloper	dublin is a pretty accepting place
2016-08-01 11:08:11	na_th_an	I don't think he's moving because he expects racism
2016-08-01 11:08:12	keveloper	it would be harder to raise an indian kid imo
2016-08-01 11:08:22	na_th_an	he probably just wants his black kid to have more than 1 other black kid in his school
2016-08-01 11:08:46	keveloper	thats an exaggeration lol
2016-08-01 11:08:54	keveloper	theres way more that 2 black kids at coffman lol
2016-08-01 11:08:57	keveloper	and other dublin schools
2016-08-01 11:08:58	na_th_an	it's not at big walnut
2016-08-01 11:09:01	keveloper	oh
2016-08-01 11:09:10	na_th_an	we literally had one black kid in my high school
2016-08-01 11:09:11	keveloper	well hilliard had a bunch of black people
2016-08-01 11:09:15	keveloper	and muslim people
2016-08-01 11:09:22	keveloper	not as many indian people iirc
2016-08-01 11:09:30	keveloper	davidson was pretty diverse
2016-08-01 11:09:31	na_th_an	do you mean indian or native american
2016-08-01 11:09:39	na_th_an	big walnut is like 98% white people
2016-08-01 11:09:51	keveloper	i will never ever say indian meaning native american
2016-08-01 11:09:52	na_th_an	probably like 95% middle to upper income
2016-08-01 11:09:55	keveloper	that pissed me off so much
2016-08-01 11:09:56	na_th_an	85%
2016-08-01 11:10:00	keveloper	pisses*
2016-08-01 11:10:05	na_th_an	it's just dumb
2016-08-01 11:10:11	keveloper	its like literally incorrect
2016-08-01 11:10:13	na_th_an	ya
2016-08-01 11:10:30	keveloper	you are calling NA indian based on complete obliviousness from 1492
2016-08-01 11:10:35	keveloper	literally
2016-08-01 11:10:35	na_th_an	we def did not have any indian or middle eastern ppl at big walnut
2016-08-01 11:10:48	keveloper	we had a pretty large muslim community
2016-08-01 11:10:57	keveloper	a lot of black people too
2016-08-01 11:11:00	keveloper	a lot of asians
2016-08-01 11:11:06	na_th_an	we had one or two asian ppl
2016-08-01 11:11:06	keveloper	mostly white people though
2016-08-01 11:11:19	keveloper	now that im thinking about it we had a good amount of diversity at davidson
2016-08-01 11:11:24	keveloper	honestly i think coffman might be worse?
2016-08-01 11:11:45	keveloper	actually based on lindseys friend group she had an indian friend, two black friends, an asian friend
2016-08-01 11:11:48	keveloper	and i think a muslim friend
2016-08-01 11:11:52	keveloper	then like 4 or 5 white friends
2016-08-01 11:12:48	keveloper	but maybe she just had an oddly diverse friend group lol
2016-08-01 11:12:56	keveloper	abby is playing with pupies right now

2016-08-01 11:16:13	keveloper	like we have fast passes
2016-08-01 11:16:18	keveloper	i think its because she is scared though

2016-08-03 10:49:46	keveloper	WEB-INF***
2016-08-03 10:49:50	keveloper	and i have no idea where its coming from
2016-08-03 10:53:53	keveloper	yizo
2016-08-03 12:30:45	keveloper	so
2016-08-03 12:30:49	keveloper	the more i see stuff that JB did
2016-08-03 12:30:52	keveloper	the less impressed i am
2016-08-03 12:31:51	na_th_an	yeah
2016-08-03 12:31:55	na_th_an	he's a good architect
2016-08-03 12:32:00	na_th_an	I truly believe that
2016-08-03 12:32:02	na_th_an	but
2016-08-03 12:32:05	na_th_an	not a great coder
2016-08-03 12:32:10	na_th_an	and the two do not have to go together
2016-08-03 12:32:14	keveloper	lol
2016-08-03 12:32:39	keveloper	i mean i dont have a great grasp on software architecture so i dont know if i can evaluate that lol
2016-08-03 12:32:48	keveloper	like from word of mouth i have to assume he is good
2016-08-03 12:32:54	keveloper	because he was like the architect guy here
2016-08-03 12:33:10	keveloper	but i also thought he could code and use a terminal well
2016-08-03 12:33:13	keveloper	but those are gone so
2016-08-03 12:34:45	na_th_an	it's amazing how bad almost everyone is at typing
2016-08-03 12:34:51	keveloper	yeah
2016-08-03 12:34:58	keveloper	i've gotten worse because ive been coding much much less
2016-08-03 12:35:00	keveloper	and typing less
2016-08-03 12:35:03	keveloper	outside of college
2016-08-03 12:35:08	keveloper	i can still type pretty well though
2016-08-03 12:35:09	keveloper	so
2016-08-03 12:35:15	na_th_an	and like, when I said I was going to spend $300 on a keyboard and jeff was like "hell no"
2016-08-03 12:35:23	na_th_an	imagine if you went to a mechanic to get your car fixed
2016-08-03 12:35:25	keveloper	he has kids and fam though
2016-08-03 12:35:27	na_th_an	and they had the shittiest craftsman tools
2016-08-03 12:35:33	na_th_an	and refused to buy snap-on
2016-08-03 12:35:33	keveloper	i see your point
2016-08-03 12:35:44	na_th_an	I'm not saying that you SHOULD spend $300 on a keyboard
2016-08-03 12:35:47	keveloper	but keyboards arent quite like that
2016-08-03 12:35:55	na_th_an	just that programmers spend a LOT of time at their keyboards
2016-08-03 12:35:58	na_th_an	and should learn to use them correctly
2016-08-03 12:36:02	na_th_an	and maybe spend more than $10 on them
2016-08-03 12:36:21	na_th_an	if I saw a mechanic that could not use a socket wrench, I would not want them to work on my car

2016-08-03 13:38:25	na_th_an	if you die with your eyes closed it's not like they suddenly open
2016-08-03 13:38:37	keveloper	if you die with your eyes closed they slowly open
2016-08-03 13:39:05	keveloper	i think like half way between open and shut is fully relaxed
2016-08-03 13:39:23	na_th_an	ya but
2016-08-03 13:39:29	na_th_an	I think it'd stay in closed position

2016-08-05 10:41:33	keveloper	thats been at 215 for like 4 weeks
2016-08-05 10:41:34	na_th_an	and could be just due to adding more databases
2016-08-05 10:41:36	na_th_an	yeah
2016-08-05 10:41:40	keveloper	idk

2016-08-05 10:42:09	na_th_an	ya we haven't changed any code on it
2016-08-05 10:42:18	na_th_an	institution changes (databases) can change the page
2016-08-05 10:42:21	keveloper	i wish i knew what was new
2016-08-05 10:42:23	na_th_an	so I assume it's that
2016-08-05 10:42:36	na_th_an	that was actually never an ask I had while working on thish achecker
2016-08-05 10:42:39	na_th_an	which is sad
2016-08-05 10:42:41	keveloper	can i just spend a day making these all 0
2016-08-05 10:42:48	na_th_an	when I did nothing as an intern for like 2 months
2016-08-05 10:42:55	na_th_an	I wish I could have had 20 minutes to talk to jeff about the achecker
2016-08-05 10:42:56	keveloper	why does detailed record have a non unique id wtf
2016-08-05 10:42:59	na_th_an	and hear him bitch about it
2016-08-05 10:43:07	na_th_an	so I'd be like "ok I'll fix some of that"
2016-08-05 10:44:02	keveloper	lol
2016-08-05 10:44:36	keveloper	i wouldnt mind spending a day fixing these honestly
2016-08-05 10:44:38	keveloper	could be fun
2016-08-05 10:44:52	keveloper	but like
2016-08-05 10:44:55	keveloper	there's an icon
2016-08-05 10:44:56	keveloper	and its like
2016-08-05 10:44:57	keveloper	SOLUTION: Replace your <code>i</code> elements with <code>em</code> or <code>strong</code>.
2016-08-05 10:45:01	keveloper	um how bout i dont
2016-08-05 10:45:06	keveloper	because i cant
2016-08-05 10:45:07	keveloper	so
2016-08-05 10:45:24	keveloper	is the AChecker out thing?
2016-08-05 10:45:29	na_th_an	no
2016-08-05 10:45:34	na_th_an	we run it
2016-08-05 10:45:37	na_th_an	but we don't make it
2016-08-05 10:45:50	keveloper	Can we disable this i element check
2016-08-05 10:45:51	keveloper	its stupid
2016-08-05 10:46:01	keveloper	its literally stupid
2016-08-05 10:46:17	keveloper	The i element is not handled as well by screen readers as the em and strong elements.
2016-08-05 10:46:19	na_th_an	it is the standard
2016-08-05 10:46:26	na_th_an	<i> and <b> have been deprecated for a while
2016-08-05 10:46:27	keveloper	thats fine but i cant put a fucking icon in an em can i
2016-08-05 10:46:36	keveloper	no i cant
2016-08-05 10:46:37	na_th_an	you can
2016-08-05 10:46:38	keveloper	what
2016-08-05 10:46:39	keveloper	you can
2016-08-05 10:46:41	keveloper	?
2016-08-05 10:46:48	na_th_an	why wouldn't you be able to?
2016-08-05 10:47:01	keveloper	because core ui looked for an i tag with an icon class?
2016-08-05 10:47:05	keveloper	looks*
2016-08-05 10:47:08	na_th_an	that's because core ui is dumb
2016-08-05 10:47:10	na_th_an	and wrong
2016-08-05 10:47:12	na_th_an	and stupid
2016-08-05 10:47:17	keveloper	i assume everything does that
2016-08-05 10:47:28	na_th_an	assume coreui is dumb, wrong and stupid
2016-08-05 10:47:31	keveloper	when icons are supposed to be <i class="whatever/>"
2016-08-05 10:47:41	keveloper	doesn't materialize?
2016-08-05 10:47:42	keveloper	why not
2016-08-05 10:47:48	keveloper	<i> is a good tag to use for icons imo
2016-08-05 10:47:58	na_th_an	idk what the standard is for icons
2016-08-05 10:48:05	na_th_an	I thought you meant, just like embedding a picture in an em tag 
2016-08-05 10:48:11	na_th_an	not using it soley as an icon
2016-08-05 10:48:13	keveloper	okay
2016-08-05 10:48:23	na_th_an	I think you'd wanna use an img tag for images to follow accessiblity guidelines
2016-08-05 10:48:24	keveloper	so i changed an <i> to <em> in materialize and it worked
2016-08-05 10:48:31	na_th_an	not sure tho
2016-08-05 10:48:50	keveloper	literally anything works (any text thing)
2016-08-05 10:48:59	keveloper	<b><p><i><em><strong>
2016-08-05 10:49:09	keveloper	i have learned something
2016-08-05 10:49:13	keveloper	is em emphasis
2016-08-05 10:49:17	na_th_an	yes
2016-08-05 10:49:36	keveloper	TIL
2016-08-05 10:49:43	keveloper	not the em thing
2016-08-05 10:49:44	keveloper	the icon
2016-08-05 10:50:44	keveloper	oh wow
2016-08-05 10:50:45	keveloper	come here
2016-08-05 10:52:07	keveloper	it doesnt work on the available badge
2016-08-05 10:52:11	keveloper	probably because so <i> specific one
2016-08-05 13:36:06	keveloper	so
2016-08-05 13:36:11	keveloper	whered u go
2016-08-05 13:40:45	keveloper	i caused that P2 yesterday :O
2016-08-05 13:40:57	keveloper	the logstash one
2016-08-05 13:41:04	na_th_an	with the ubiquity migration?
2016-08-05 13:41:07	na_th_an	nbd
2016-08-05 13:41:10	na_th_an	it seemed p easy to fix
2016-08-05 13:41:12	keveloper	yeah
2016-08-05 13:41:20	keveloper	except it was P2 yeah it was an easy fix
2016-08-05 13:42:06	na_th_an	lol
2016-08-05 13:42:08	na_th_an	: to =
2016-08-05 13:42:13	keveloper	yeah
2016-08-05 13:42:28	keveloper	there was a lot of : to = and = to : in ubiquity migrations
2016-08-05 13:42:29	keveloper	so
2016-08-05 13:42:33	keveloper	idk how that happened
2016-08-05 13:42:59	keveloper	things went from properties files to ansible files so all the = had to be changed to : and i probably just did that one on accident
2016-08-05 13:43:07	na_th_an	can we go home now
2016-08-05 13:43:09	na_th_an	plz

2016-08-08 09:47:04	keveloper	entertaining
2016-08-08 09:47:11	keveloper	it wasnt great but it wasnt as bad as critics said it was
2016-08-08 09:49:59	na_th_an	I'd probably hate it
2016-08-08 09:50:12	keveloper	anyway
2016-08-08 09:50:32	keveloper	the first time harley quinn showed up a bunch of dudes in the back of the theatre started clapping
2016-08-08 09:50:44	keveloper	and we were like what the fuck
2016-08-08 09:51:00	keveloper	im assuming it was like neck beards
2016-08-08 09:51:20	keveloper	who think its socially okay to do that because they spend all their time in r/yiff
2016-08-08 09:51:35	keveloper	neck beards or 14 year olds one of the two
2016-08-08 09:52:19	na_th_an	or frat boys
2016-08-08 09:52:27	na_th_an	I can picture a lot of ppl at osu that would do that
2016-08-08 09:52:38	keveloper	there we no frat boys there lol
2016-08-08 09:52:59	keveloper	there were a bunch of high schoolers and then a bunch of neck beards
2016-08-08 09:53:05	keveloper	fedora guys yanno
2016-08-08 09:53:37	keveloper	so it was like an alright movie right
2016-08-08 09:53:43	keveloper	then all of the sudden towards the end
2016-08-08 09:53:55	keveloper	there was this absolutely incredible shot
2016-08-08 09:53:59	keveloper	and i was like :O
2016-08-08 09:54:08	keveloper	and the artistic value of like the last 2 minutes sky rocketed lol
2016-08-08 09:54:17	keveloper	so there's this witch in it
2016-08-08 09:54:34	keveloper	and she can make people see things to try to convince them to not do shit yanno
2016-08-08 09:54:40	keveloper	etc.
2016-08-08 09:55:03	keveloper	and deadshot (will smith's) character has a daughter
2016-08-08 09:55:07	keveloper	who know's he's a hitman
2016-08-08 09:55:27	na_th_an	k
2016-08-08 09:55:42	keveloper	and earlier in the movie said she didn't want to live with him and she wnated to live with her mom because he kills people
2016-08-08 09:55:57	keveloper	so a big motivation of him in the movie is to be a better person for his daughter ya no
2016-08-08 09:56:00	keveloper	ya kno*
2016-08-08 09:56:01	na_th_an	k
2016-08-08 09:56:06	keveloper	so towards the end
2016-08-08 09:56:25	keveloper	reptile guy throws this bag of C4 at this thing they need to destroy
2016-08-08 09:56:32	keveloper	its keeping the witch alive
2016-08-08 09:56:48	keveloper	and deadshot aims to shoot it
2016-08-08 09:56:48	na_th_an	did it startle the witch?
2016-08-08 09:57:02	keveloper	the witch is on her knees about to die
2016-08-08 09:57:03	keveloper	v weak
2016-08-08 09:57:06	na_th_an	p sure shooting c4 doesn't make it explode 
2016-08-08 09:57:09	na_th_an	but continue
2016-08-08 09:57:10	keveloper	yes it does
2016-08-08 09:57:13	keveloper	its an impact explosive
2016-08-08 09:57:25	keveloper	it requires shock to explode
2016-08-08 09:57:30	keveloper	like kinetic energy
2016-08-08 09:57:33	keveloper	anyway
2016-08-08 09:57:39	keveloper	idek if it was C4
2016-08-08 09:58:08	keveloper	guy throws explosive, deadshot (will smith) has to shoot it when it gets close to the thing to kill the witch
2016-08-08 09:58:14	na_th_an	C-4 is very stable and insensitive to most physical shocks. C-4 cannot be detonated by a gunshot or by dropping it onto a hard surface. It does not explode when set on fire or exposed to microwave radiation.[8] Detonation can only be initiated by a combination of extreme heat and a shockwave, such as when a detonator inserted into it is fired.
2016-08-08 09:58:22	na_th_an	but anyway
2016-08-08 09:58:24	na_th_an	continue
2016-08-08 09:58:29	keveloper	okay well i dont even think it was C4
2016-08-08 09:58:40	keveloper	ANYWAY jesus
2016-08-08 09:58:59	na_th_an	continue
2016-08-08 09:59:03	na_th_an	I said continue the first time jeez
2016-08-08 09:59:51	keveloper	so the witch is on her knees as deadshot is aiming and she's staring at him and he starts seeing his daughter directly under his gun crying and asking him not do it, and there's this side profile shot and he's resting his gun on his daughters head aiming at the thing and his daughter is looking up at him and it was one of the best shots i have seen in a movie in a long time
2016-08-08 10:00:14	keveloper	and i was just like WOW
2016-08-08 10:00:19	keveloper	then the rest of the movie was okay lol
2016-08-08 10:00:23	keveloper	but that 3 seconds was great
2016-08-08 10:00:29	keveloper	by far the best shot of the movie
2016-08-08 10:00:58	keveloper	i tried looking for it but i couldnt find it
2016-08-08 10:01:06	keveloper	its like the HALO jump in the new godzilla
2016-08-08 10:01:20	keveloper	a random break from the feel of the movie to bring you an absolutely beatiful shot
2016-08-08 10:01:27	keveloper	have you seen the 2014 godzilla
2016-08-08 10:01:31	na_th_an	no
2016-08-08 10:01:35	keveloper	so its just a decent movie
2016-08-08 10:01:40	keveloper	super good sound design but
2016-08-08 10:01:41	keveloper	anyway
2016-08-08 10:03:04	keveloper	there's this seen in the middle of it where these soldiers are doing a HALO jump to some Gyorgy Ligeti choral music and they have red smoke trails on their ankles and it depicts angels descending to hell like dante's inferno shit and it is BEAUTIFUL
2016-08-08 10:03:14	keveloper	and its just randomly in the middle of the not so artsy movie

2016-08-08 12:38:07	na_th_an	state park camping is really expensive
2016-08-08 12:38:15	na_th_an	I guess not really expensive
2016-08-08 12:38:23	na_th_an	but it seemed like more $$$ than it should be last time i looked at it
2016-08-08 12:38:49	na_th_an	I can't listen to music bc mark is talking so much
2016-08-08 12:38:53	na_th_an	and i really hate music + ppl talking

2016-08-08 15:00:08	keveloper	im assuming she thinks they are user passwords
2016-08-08 15:00:14	keveloper	and doesnt know what is going on
2016-08-08 15:00:53	keveloper	like these are DB passwords that go in service config somewhere

2016-08-08 15:01:15	keveloper	this is not sensitive data rashmi
2016-08-08 15:01:29	na_th_an	there's an incident open to make it so we can't see them I think

2016-08-08 15:01:44	na_th_an	they're like "oh shit we can see these passwords"
2016-08-08 15:01:47	na_th_an	yes
2016-08-08 15:01:54	keveloper	that whole incident?
2016-08-08 15:02:07	keveloper	the incident is about special characters breaking XML
2016-08-08 15:02:11	na_th_an	there's the big incident
2016-08-08 15:02:16	na_th_an	of Elon being down
2016-08-08 15:02:22	na_th_an	we fixed that by tweaking the FIND record
2016-08-08 15:02:29	na_th_an	and that restored service and closed the incident
2016-08-08 15:02:36	na_th_an	but then we opened two incidents from that first incident
2016-08-08 15:02:41	na_th_an	one to fix the passwords

2016-08-08 15:03:10	na_th_an	idk where you've been, this was emailed
2016-08-08 15:03:45	na_th_an	Two child incidents have been created off of this one:

2016-08-16 08:47:16	na_th_an	probably like 2.2 displacement
2016-08-16 08:47:22	keveloper	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Toyota_MR2_rear_20071002.jpg
2016-08-16 08:47:24	keveloper	it might be
2016-08-16 08:47:33	na_th_an	way way older than that one

2016-08-23 10:50:56	keveloper	http://wcilr-m1.dev.oclc.org/WCILR/
2016-08-23 10:51:03	keveloper	yeah dui hasn't been remediated yet

2016-08-23 10:51:28	na_th_an	is it the same service

2016-08-23 10:51:40	na_th_an	well
2016-08-23 10:51:42	keveloper	its a different instance of the same service
2016-08-23 10:51:43	na_th_an	I'm trying it
2016-08-23 10:51:45	keveloper	if that was your questions
2016-08-23 10:51:47	keveloper	queiont*
2016-08-23 10:51:50	keveloper	wow lol

2016-08-23 10:51:52	keveloper	question*
2016-08-23 10:51:54	na_th_an	lol
2016-08-23 10:53:17	na_th_an	that URL produces a different response format
2016-08-23 10:55:00	na_th_an	is that the CI WCILR?
2016-08-23 10:55:12	na_th_an	do we have a CI WCILR?
2016-08-23 10:55:22	na_th_an	you know the most about WCILR on this team
2016-08-23 10:55:35	keveloper	you ready for the best code review ever
2016-08-23 10:55:36	keveloper	yes
2016-08-23 10:55:43	keveloper	that is CI wcilr
2016-08-23 10:55:54	na_th_an	:( why is the response totaly different wtf
2016-08-23 10:56:07	keveloper	try the actual server
2016-08-23 10:56:07	keveloper	http://wcilrap01dxm1.dev.oclc.org:8080/WCILR/
2016-08-23 10:56:25	keveloper	idk, its using DR which is not totally healthy
2016-08-23 10:56:29	keveloper	so it could be that
2016-08-23 10:56:58	na_th_an	the old URLs wrap the response in a {'result': actualResponse }
2016-08-23 10:57:05	na_th_an	that new one just has actualResponse
2016-08-23 10:57:29	na_th_an	wait
2016-08-23 10:57:32	na_th_an	nvm ignore me
2016-08-23 10:57:48	keveloper	..
2016-08-23 10:57:50	keveloper	is it the same?
2016-08-23 10:57:55	na_th_an	ikd
2016-08-23 10:57:56	na_th_an	idk
2016-08-23 12:46:56	keveloper	hey
2016-08-23 12:47:04	keveloper	is there a reason i should get the UD3H over the Gaming 3
2016-08-23 12:47:48	na_th_an	h/o
2016-08-23 12:47:51	keveloper	other way around i mean
2016-08-23 12:47:54	na_th_an	do you have links
2016-08-23 12:47:58	keveloper	http://motherboards.specout.com/compare/3462-3760/GIGABYTE-GA-Z97X-UD3H-vs-MSI-Z97-GAMING-5
2016-08-23 12:50:20	keveloper	They look about the same
2016-08-23 12:51:56	na_th_an	they are mostly the same
2016-08-23 12:51:58	na_th_an	they have the same chipset
2016-08-23 12:52:24	keveloper	why do these still have PS/2 lol
2016-08-23 12:52:24	na_th_an	the gaming one has better expansion slots, an M2 slot, and a digital error readout
2016-08-23 12:52:32	na_th_an	as well as way more headers for fans and stuff like that
2016-08-23 12:52:42	na_th_an	if you're going to spend the money I think it's worth it to get the gaming one
2016-08-23 12:52:46	keveloper	where do you see that
2016-08-23 12:53:01	na_th_an	I checked the specs listed on amazon bc that website sucks
2016-08-23 12:53:09	keveloper	oh :(\
2016-08-23 12:53:25	na_th_an	there are enough small things about the gaming one that make it worth it
2016-08-23 12:53:54	keveloper	$135 tho
2016-08-23 12:54:34	na_th_an	having built a lot of computers
2016-08-23 12:54:44	na_th_an	I'd highly recommend the slightly better mb
2016-08-23 12:54:44	keveloper	do you know why this is so much cheaper 
2016-08-23 12:54:45	keveloper	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K8HNGXS/?tag=pcpapi-20
2016-08-23 12:54:59	na_th_an	bc it's micro atx and has way less stuff
2016-08-23 12:55:07	keveloper	oh i didn't see the micro part okay
2016-08-23 12:55:19	keveloper	so should get the MSI Z97 Gaming 5
2016-08-23 12:55:26	na_th_an	I would recommend it
2016-08-23 12:55:28	keveloper	Okay
2016-08-23 12:55:33	na_th_an	I'd recommend getting a decent MB
2016-08-23 12:55:37	na_th_an	not the cheapest
2016-08-23 12:55:42	na_th_an	but you don't need the crazy $200
2016-08-23 12:55:58	keveloper	What kinda ram ya got
2016-08-23 12:56:15	keveloper	All i Know is corsair, and ballistix lol
2016-08-23 12:56:27	na_th_an	there's two things about ram
2016-08-23 12:56:32	na_th_an	clock speed and the CP rating
2016-08-23 12:56:45	keveloper	okay
2016-08-23 12:56:46	na_th_an	CPx ram takes x cycles to read/write memory
2016-08-23 12:56:57	na_th_an	so you could have 1600mhz CP12 memory
2016-08-23 12:57:04	na_th_an	or 1333mhz CP6 memory
2016-08-23 12:57:17	na_th_an	and even though the 1333mhz is clocked slower, it'd be faster
2016-08-23 12:57:27	na_th_an	it really doesn't matter that much tho
2016-08-23 12:57:41	na_th_an	again, don't get the cheapest crap but you don't need to go super high end either
2016-08-23 12:58:21	keveloper	Do you have 16 or 32
2016-08-23 12:58:23	na_th_an	CL*
2016-08-23 12:58:24	na_th_an	not CP
2016-08-23 12:58:34	na_th_an	I have 16 in my main rig I think
2016-08-23 12:58:40	keveloper	Have you ever wanted more
2016-08-23 12:58:42	na_th_an	which isn't really neccessary
2016-08-23 12:58:56	keveloper	So 16 is enough you are saying
2016-08-23 12:58:58	na_th_an	the only time I ever needed 16 was when I was running a 24/7 virtual machine
2016-08-23 12:59:04	na_th_an	12 would be enough
2016-08-23 12:59:05	keveloper	lol
2016-08-23 12:59:10	na_th_an	but might as well go with 16
2016-08-23 12:59:15	na_th_an	8 is probably *enough*
2016-08-23 12:59:22	na_th_an	but you'd want at least 12
2016-08-23 12:59:23	keveloper	i'll do 16
2016-08-23 12:59:26	na_th_an	and it's cheap enough to go 16
2016-08-23 12:59:40	na_th_an	but ya the Crucial Ballistix 1600mhz CL9 memory is solid
2016-08-23 12:59:42	na_th_an	that's what I have
2016-08-23 13:00:23	na_th_an	are you building a PC
2016-08-23 13:00:33	keveloper	v thinkin bout it
2016-08-23 13:00:47	na_th_an	do it
2016-08-23 13:00:55	na_th_an	what cpu are you looking at
2016-08-23 13:01:21	keveloper	i7 4790k
2016-08-23 13:01:31	na_th_an	lol
2016-08-23 13:01:43	keveloper	what is that too much

2016-08-23 13:01:58	na_th_an	but with what you're looking at you're almost exactly copying my build lol

2016-08-23 13:02:23	na_th_an	i7 4790k, hyper evo 212, crucial ballistix 16GB, MSI Gaming 5

2016-08-23 13:02:49	keveloper	how many SSDs do you have
2016-08-23 13:02:57	na_th_an	and an ancient 120GB SSD that needs to be replaced
2016-08-23 13:03:09	na_th_an	then I have 2x 1TB HDDs that are RAID mirrored with my Linux /home on them
2016-08-23 13:03:15	na_th_an	and a 1TB HDD for Windows

2016-08-23 13:03:56	na_th_an	yeah if I sold my entire rig it'd be a lot
2016-08-23 13:04:07	na_th_an	vive + monitor + computer + keyboard + racing wheel
2016-08-23 13:05:41	keveloper	na_th_an hyper evo 212 is a cooler lol
2016-08-23 13:05:42	na_th_an	oh I also highly recommend the NZXT 210
2016-08-23 13:05:45	keveloper	what 500gb ssd do you have

2016-08-23 13:06:36	keveloper	?
2016-08-23 13:06:40	na_th_an	ya it's about that
2016-08-23 13:06:57	na_th_an	you can save a little money without losing that much performance by getting a 750 EVO
2016-08-23 13:07:04	keveloper	alright choose a video card time
2016-08-23 13:07:06	na_th_an	but the 850 evo is worth it
2016-08-23 13:07:13	na_th_an	do you have a case yet
2016-08-23 13:07:18	keveloper	no
2016-08-23 13:07:25	na_th_an	the NZXT Source 210 is what I use in two of my builds and it's great
2016-08-23 13:07:30	keveloper	There's a bunch of 1070s which onedo i get lol
2016-08-23 13:07:31	na_th_an	no obnoxious logos, looks clean

2016-08-23 13:08:36	keveloper	$450?
2016-08-23 13:08:44	na_th_an	that's reasonable
2016-08-23 13:08:51	keveloper	this is adding up
2016-08-23 13:09:00	na_th_an	you can do some things incrementally
2016-08-23 13:09:15	keveloper	I'm at $1116.96
2016-08-23 13:09:15	na_th_an	you don't need a SSD right away
2016-08-23 13:09:20	na_th_an	you could start with 8GB of RAM
2016-08-23 13:09:24	keveloper	But I want an SSD right away
2016-08-23 13:09:31	keveloper	doing 8GB of RAM woul dsave me $30 lol
2016-08-23 13:09:55	na_th_an	ya your CPU, MB and GPU are the biggest expense
2016-08-23 13:10:01	na_th_an	do you have a PSU?

2016-08-23 13:11:50	na_th_an	I got a refurb Corsair PSU at Microcenter for cheap
2016-08-23 13:11:57	na_th_an	I recommend doing that
2016-08-23 13:12:04	na_th_an	they probably have a modular one too for slightly more
2016-08-23 13:12:09	keveloper	Do you have an optical drive
2016-08-23 13:12:11	na_th_an	which is nice but not needed
2016-08-23 13:12:16	na_th_an	I do but I've used it like 3 times ever
2016-08-23 13:12:25	keveloper	i should probably have one
2016-08-23 13:12:32	na_th_an	you could spend $15 on one but it's almost not worth the time spent installing it
2016-08-23 13:12:37	keveloper	lol
2016-08-23 13:12:49	keveloper	Im gonna get the Asus DRW-24B1ST

2016-08-23 13:13:28	keveloper	Did you pay $130 for it lomao
2016-08-23 13:13:28	na_th_an	bc I had windows 7 pro for free through MSDN
2016-08-23 13:13:38	keveloper	I think I can get windows 10 through cap for free now
2016-08-23 13:13:38	na_th_an	then I upgraded to windows 10 pro for free
2016-08-23 13:13:48	na_th_an	then when I got a new MB and CPU it invalidated my license

2016-08-23 13:15:53	na_th_an	1440p
2016-08-23 13:16:25	na_th_an	remote desktop and group policy are the only things I could really see pro being worth it
2016-08-23 13:16:32	keveloper	Yeah
2016-08-23 13:16:36	na_th_an	I think Home N and Pro N are only like $10 diff
2016-08-23 13:16:49	na_th_an	might be worth it but you probably won't care if you get Home N
2016-08-23 13:16:58	na_th_an	the N is just without windows media player
2016-08-23 13:17:02	na_th_an	which you really shouldn't ever need
2016-08-23 13:17:07	keveloper	1440 monitors are pricey
2016-08-23 13:17:13	na_th_an	ya
2016-08-23 13:17:18	na_th_an	1080p monitors are cheap
2016-08-23 13:17:26	na_th_an	1440p is still a pretty niche market
2016-08-23 13:17:28	keveloper	do you recommned any brands
2016-08-23 13:17:43	na_th_an	are you looking at 1080p?

2016-08-23 13:17:53	na_th_an	just find something with an IPS panel and you should be good
2016-08-23 13:17:58	keveloper	Wat about this samsung 4k one for $1202
2016-08-23 13:18:08	keveloper	Wtf is an ips panel
2016-08-23 13:18:10	na_th_an	there are only a couple places that manufacture IPS panels and they're all about the same quality now
2016-08-23 13:18:13	na_th_an	in-plane switching
2016-08-23 13:18:19	na_th_an	as opposed to TN panels 
2016-08-23 13:18:22	na_th_an	IPS is better
2016-08-23 13:18:24	na_th_an	better colors
2016-08-23 13:18:30	na_th_an	they're pretty standard now
2016-08-23 13:18:43	na_th_an	just make sure the monitor is IPS and has decent reviews and it should be fine
2016-08-23 13:18:45	keveloper	https://www.amazon.com/Acer-H276HL-bmid-27-Inch-Widescreen/dp/B00G5AH2YG

2016-08-23 13:22:52	keveloper	sry not sry

2016-08-23 13:23:21	keveloper	3***
2016-08-23 13:23:26	na_th_an	oh through OCLC?
2016-08-23 13:23:36	na_th_an	it depends on how much you spend
2016-08-23 13:23:38	keveloper	$55 a month
2016-08-23 13:23:41	keveloper	$1335
2016-08-23 13:23:45	na_th_an	but I think at 1.3k you can do 3 years
2016-08-23 13:23:56	keveloper	I would do 2 years just in case
2016-08-23 13:24:06	keveloper	Should I do like a ound card or case fan or something
2016-08-23 13:24:07	na_th_an	do it
2016-08-23 13:24:18	na_th_an	you could get like 1 or 2 120mm fans if you wanted
2016-08-23 13:24:20	na_th_an	it won't hurt
2016-08-23 13:24:27	keveloper	How much are they
2016-08-23 13:24:38	keveloper	Do you have a fan controller
2016-08-23 13:24:39	na_th_an	you don't need a sound card unless you are going to do some very serious music production
2016-08-23 13:24:43	na_th_an	you do not need a fan controller
2016-08-23 13:24:46	na_th_an	I do not have one
2016-08-23 13:24:46	keveloper	I might though lol
2016-08-23 13:25:05	keveloper	My estimated wattage is 336W is that a lot
2016-08-23 13:25:10	na_th_an	no

2016-08-23 13:26:24	na_th_an	my usage is around 500 watts I think

2016-08-23 13:26:32	na_th_an	1x120mm
2016-08-23 13:26:35	keveloper	Do I want another
2016-08-23 13:26:40	na_th_an	it wouldn't be a bad idea
2016-08-23 13:26:44	na_th_an	but it's probbaly not needed
2016-08-23 13:26:44	keveloper	Highest air flow
2016-08-23 13:26:56	keveloper	i want my computer to be as cold as texas in the summer

2016-08-23 13:28:18	keveloper	How much was each fan
2016-08-23 13:28:30	na_th_an	I literally bought the cheapest 120mm fan at microcenter
2016-08-23 13:28:32	keveloper	How can I make sure all this stuff is compatible with eachother
2016-08-23 13:28:34	na_th_an	it was $4

2016-08-23 13:28:58	keveloper	Do you have network adapters or anything
2016-08-23 13:28:59	na_th_an	you need to make sure your CPU and MB socket match
2016-08-23 13:29:13	keveloper	Ooh I might need a wireless network adapter in my aptp
2016-08-23 13:29:14	na_th_an	you need to make sure your ram is the right kind (DDR3)
2016-08-23 13:29:18	keveloper	It is
2016-08-23 13:29:22	na_th_an	that's about it

2016-08-23 13:30:43	keveloper	i want to

2016-08-23 13:31:06	na_th_an	I do not have every slot used
2016-08-23 13:31:12	na_th_an	there's also a side intake
2016-08-23 13:31:33	keveloper	So the COoler Master Sickle Flow is 120mm 69.7 CFM, 19 dbA and $5.88
2016-08-23 13:31:36	keveloper	seems pretty good
2016-08-23 13:31:45	na_th_an	ya sounds fine
2016-08-23 13:31:51	na_th_an	there's not a huge difference between fans

2016-08-23 13:33:12	na_th_an	if you build this computer it'll be a beast
2016-08-23 13:33:19	keveloper	not as good as yours lol
2016-08-23 13:33:24	na_th_an	a decent step up from the computer that you played minecraft on
2016-08-23 13:33:26	na_th_an	with my vive
2016-08-23 13:33:30	keveloper	Ending price is $1346.87
2016-08-23 13:33:35	na_th_an	barely worse than mine
2016-08-23 13:33:41	na_th_an	the only real difference would be the 1080
2016-08-23 13:33:42	keveloper	I played minecraft on a 2011 macbook pro
2016-08-23 13:33:53	na_th_an	the one you played minecraft in VR on 
2016-08-23 13:33:57	na_th_an	my original VR build
2016-08-23 13:33:57	keveloper	Ohhh
2016-08-23 13:34:13	keveloper	Do I need anything else
2016-08-23 13:34:22	na_th_an	link to build
2016-08-23 13:34:29	keveloper	http://pcpartpicker.com/list/9f3fPs
2016-08-23 13:34:34	keveloper	wireless network adapter if i need it
2016-08-23 13:34:53	na_th_an	you can get that at microcenter
2016-08-23 13:35:00	keveloper	for cheap
2016-08-23 13:35:03	na_th_an	you should probably get a Wireless AC adapter when you do
2016-08-23 13:35:07	na_th_an	ya cheap
2016-08-23 13:35:12	keveloper	what does that do
2016-08-23 13:35:16	na_th_an	my friend got a $20 USB wireless AC adapter
2016-08-23 13:35:21	na_th_an	AC is the next N
2016-08-23 13:35:28	keveloper	Ohh ya
2016-08-23 13:35:28	keveloper	okay
2016-08-23 13:35:33	keveloper	I saw AC and thought current
2016-08-23 13:35:35	keveloper	and was like what
2016-08-23 13:35:45	keveloper	But I remember now lol
2016-08-23 13:35:47	na_th_an	a PCI Express (internal) wifi card is probably a little better
2016-08-23 13:35:50	keveloper	My router isn't AC i dont think
2016-08-23 13:35:57	na_th_an	it's backward compatible
2016-08-23 13:36:02	keveloper	Ah
2016-08-23 13:36:08	keveloper	well I won't get the benfits of AC
2016-08-23 13:36:15	na_th_an	no but the price difference is small
2016-08-23 13:36:17	keveloper	I always though fan controllers were cool
2016-08-23 13:36:22	keveloper	can you just plug them in and they work
2016-08-23 13:36:25	na_th_an	idk
2016-08-23 13:36:27	na_th_an	never had one
2016-08-23 13:36:31	keveloper	what is a thermal compound
2016-08-23 13:36:31	na_th_an	I'll probably do that eventually
2016-08-23 13:36:41	keveloper	i want LEDs too though
2016-08-23 13:36:43	na_th_an	thermal compound goes between your CPU heat sink and your CPU
2016-08-23 13:36:54	na_th_an	your MB and GPU will have LEDs on them
2016-08-23 13:36:59	na_th_an	you can also get LED fans
2016-08-23 13:37:08	na_th_an	the hyper evo 212 comes with thermal compound
2016-08-23 13:37:27	keveloper	Is there a glass side of the source 210
2016-08-23 13:37:55	keveloper	Aw no, I always thought those were cool
2016-08-23 13:38:15	na_th_an	no there isn't
2016-08-23 13:38:18	na_th_an	you could get one that does have that
2016-08-23 13:38:29	na_th_an	source 210 isn't a flashy case
2016-08-23 13:38:43	keveloper	With they all have the 120mm fan slots on the top and back and front
2016-08-23 13:38:45	keveloper	because i want those
2016-08-23 13:38:54	na_th_an	huh
2016-08-23 13:38:58	na_th_an	will?
2016-08-23 13:39:01	keveloper	will the*

2016-08-23 13:42:32	na_th_an	part of the reason I have the source 210 is that it has a TON of drive bays

2016-08-23 13:45:09	na_th_an	you'll probably eventually want to put some platter storage in there
2016-08-23 13:45:24	na_th_an	but
2016-08-23 13:45:33	na_th_an	if your internet is good and you don't have data caps it doesn't matter as much
2016-08-23 13:45:47	na_th_an	especially if you aren't storing videos/movies/music etc
2016-08-23 13:46:00	keveloper	Yeah I'll probably wanna RAID

2016-08-23 13:46:27	keveloper	idk
2016-08-23 13:46:31	keveloper	ive given it no thought yet
2016-08-23 13:46:40	na_th_an	unless you have AT&T w/o cable then you do not have data caps
2016-08-23 13:47:19	keveloper	I have time warner without cable

2016-08-23 13:52:48	keveloper	quinton says the graphics card is overkill
2016-08-23 13:52:52	keveloper	yeah
2016-08-23 13:52:56	na_th_an	I mean
2016-08-23 13:53:01	na_th_an	mildly
2016-08-23 13:53:07	na_th_an	you could get like, a 1060
2016-08-23 13:53:15	na_th_an	but the 1070 is a really good card
2016-08-23 13:53:23	na_th_an	with a good price:performance ratio
2016-08-23 14:30:27	keveloper	so basically who cares fuck it
2016-08-23 14:30:29	keveloper	i buy the best shit
2016-08-23 14:30:36	na_th_an	yes
2016-08-23 14:30:44	na_th_an	honestly the 1070 isn't overkill
2016-08-23 14:30:48	na_th_an	you could get away with less
2016-08-23 14:30:50	na_th_an	but it's not overkill
2016-08-23 14:31:03	na_th_an	you have a reasonable high end rig set up there
2016-08-23 14:31:11	keveloper	I'm a high end man
2016-08-23 14:31:12	keveloper	what can i say
2016-08-23 14:31:26	keveloper	SS complimented my work like 9 times when i was just talking to them :)
2016-08-23 14:31:27	keveloper	lol
2016-08-23 14:31:27	na_th_an	it's much easier to get the german performance cal feeling with a PC than a car
2016-08-23 14:31:34	na_th_an	car*
2016-08-23 14:31:39	na_th_an	my computer is like VROOM
2016-08-23 14:32:02	keveloper	lol
2016-08-23 14:32:15	keveloper	i'd say the perfomance car feeling in an actual car might be better
2016-08-23 14:33:31	na_th_an	well ya
2016-08-23 14:33:40	na_th_an	but also over 10x as much
2016-08-23 14:36:19	keveloper	what size is your case
2016-08-23 14:36:20	keveloper	mid tower?
2016-08-23 14:36:54	keveloper	You have a mid tower case with the same MB right
2016-08-23 14:37:27	na_th_an	ya
2016-08-23 14:37:28	na_th_an	think so
2016-08-23 14:37:34	keveloper	MSI Z97MX Gaming 5
2016-08-23 14:37:44	keveloper	And the NZXT Source 210 S210-001 Mid
2016-08-23 14:38:15	na_th_an	ya that sounds right
2016-08-23 14:43:10	keveloper	how can i tell if it fits
2016-08-23 14:43:17	keveloper	if part picker allows it?
2016-08-23 14:43:37	keveloper	uh
2016-08-23 14:43:38	keveloper	The NZXT Source 220 ATX Mid Tower Case supports video cards up to 330mm long, but video cards over 230mm may block drive bays. Since the MSI GeForce GTX 1070 8GB Video Card is 279mm long, some drive bays may not be usable.
2016-08-23 14:43:39	keveloper	halp
2016-08-23 14:44:05	keveloper	Is that fine
2016-08-23 14:44:42	keveloper	seems fine
2016-08-23 14:47:54	na_th_an	ya it's fine
2016-08-23 14:48:02	na_th_an	I think my 1080 blocks a drive bay 
2016-08-23 14:48:52	keveloper	i'd assume
2016-08-23 15:15:20	keveloper	message from emily: "i bought a curtan rod support for you"

2016-08-23 15:38:51	na_th_an	1400 on a computer is a waste of money but spending extra money on a nicer car isn't a waste

2016-08-24 11:11:57	keveloper	oh
2016-08-24 11:12:00	na_th_an	steam controller is alright for FPS
2016-08-24 11:12:06	keveloper	i disagree
2016-08-24 11:12:08	na_th_an	better than a xbone controller 
2016-08-24 11:12:11	na_th_an	worse than mouse and kbd
2016-08-24 11:12:20	keveloper	but ive also gamed fps on a 360 for like 600 more hours than you so
2016-08-24 11:12:35	keveloper	probably more than that lol
2016-08-24 11:12:42	na_th_an	it's inarguable that analog sticks are not great FPS controllers
2016-08-24 11:12:49	na_th_an	they put aim assist into console FPS games for a reason

2016-08-25 15:09:36	na_th_an	/exec -o uptime
2016-08-25 15:10:14	keveloper	did not owkr
2016-08-25 15:10:35	na_th_an	 15:10:36 up 85 days, 23:42,  7 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
2016-08-25 15:10:39	na_th_an	definitely does
2016-08-25 15:10:48	keveloper	is exec an executable at root
2016-08-25 15:10:50	keveloper	thats weird
2016-08-25 15:10:51	na_th_an	ok
2016-08-25 15:10:55	na_th_an	in irc
2016-08-25 15:10:58	na_th_an	type /exec -o root
2016-08-25 15:11:05	keveloper	 15:11:05 up 37 days,  6:38,  6 users,  load average: 0.12, 0.08, 0.06
2016-08-25 15:11:06	na_th_an	and by root
2016-08-25 15:11:08	keveloper	ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
2016-08-25 15:11:09	na_th_an	I mean 'uptime"
2016-08-25 15:11:27	keveloper	i was like wtf man this command makes no sense
2016-08-25 15:11:36	na_th_an	lol
2016-08-25 15:11:47	na_th_an	/exec runs commands on your shell
2016-08-25 15:11:54	na_th_an	-o outputs the command into the channel
2016-08-25 15:12:04	keveloper	i've left weechat though
2016-08-25 15:12:11	keveloper	thats not my server uptime
2016-08-25 15:12:17	na_th_an	:O what
2016-08-25 15:12:31	na_th_an	you aren't on weechat?
2016-08-25 15:12:38	keveloper	no
2016-08-25 15:12:41	keveloper	like in the passed
2016-08-25 15:12:45	na_th_an	past
2016-08-25 15:12:46	na_th_an	?
2016-08-25 15:12:49	keveloper	oh "uptime" is literally a command
2016-08-25 15:12:51	na_th_an	what are you on
2016-08-25 15:12:53	na_th_an	yet
2016-08-25 15:12:55	na_th_an	yes
2016-08-25 15:12:55	keveloper	weechat
2016-08-25 15:13:03	na_th_an	so you are on weechat
2016-08-25 15:13:11	keveloper	i mean literally quit weechat
2016-08-25 15:13:13	keveloper	i was confused
2016-08-25 15:13:29	keveloper	my uptime is 37 days
2016-08-25 15:13:30	na_th_an	I have no idea what you're saying
2016-08-25 15:13:32	keveloper	6 users
2016-08-25 15:13:32	na_th_an	yes
2016-08-25 15:13:32	keveloper	huh
2016-08-25 15:13:45	na_th_an	what wasn't your server uptime
2016-08-25 15:13:48	na_th_an	what do you mean you left weechat
2016-08-25 15:14:03	keveloper	nothing
2016-08-25 15:14:12	keveloper	i thought that was weechat uptime
2016-08-25 15:14:15	keveloper	i was confused
2016-08-25 15:14:21	keveloper	my macbook uptime is 23 days
2016-08-25 15:14:23	keveloper	i should restart lol
2016-08-25 15:14:24	na_th_an	lol
2016-08-25 15:14:27	na_th_an	eh nbd
2016-08-25 15:14:33	na_th_an	mine is 6 days
2016-08-25 15:14:37	keveloper	dude i love this new kb
2016-08-25 15:14:46	na_th_an	mx reds right?
2016-08-25 15:14:49	keveloper	yeah
2016-08-25 15:14:54	keveloper	full size
2016-08-25 15:15:00	keveloper	sweet red LEDs
2016-08-25 15:15:03	keveloper	brightness control
2016-08-25 15:15:07	keveloper	mouse usb port
2016-08-25 15:15:11	keveloper	i love that mouse too
2016-08-25 15:15:13	keveloper	i love it all
2016-08-25 15:15:16	keveloper	i love the 1070
2016-08-25 15:15:19	na_th_an	:) glad you like the mouse
2016-08-25 15:15:19	keveloper	i have 9 fans in my computer
2016-08-25 15:15:22	na_th_an	I like that mouse a lot
2016-08-25 15:15:36	na_th_an	my monitor has USB ports and came with a USB cable for it
2016-08-25 15:15:38	na_th_an	it's nice
2016-08-25 15:16:31	keveloper	2 front intake, 1 top intake, 1 cpu cooler fan, 1 back outtake, 1 PSU fan, 3 GPU fans lol
2016-08-25 15:16:33	keveloper	i love it
2016-08-25 15:16:36	keveloper	runnin cool
2016-08-25 15:16:36	na_th_an	lol
2016-08-25 15:16:51	na_th_an	your GPU fans won't run unless they need to either
2016-08-25 15:17:01	na_th_an	I was playing Cities Skylines and they weren't even on
2016-08-25 15:17:02	keveloper	the airflow coming in the top, through the cooler heat sink, out the back is so cool
2016-08-25 15:17:16	na_th_an	you're doing intake in the top? :O
2016-08-25 15:17:28	keveloper	yeah feeding the air into the cpu cooler
2016-08-25 15:17:42	keveloper	there wouldnt be cool air for it to get
2016-08-25 15:17:46	na_th_an	I wouldn't do that
2016-08-25 15:17:47	keveloper	the graphics card kind restricts airflow
2016-08-25 15:17:48	keveloper	why
2016-08-25 15:17:59	na_th_an	you want the air to go bottom->top front->back
2016-08-25 15:18:04	keveloper	yeah but
2016-08-25 15:18:07	keveloper	okay lemme draw this for oyu
2016-08-25 15:18:10	keveloper	im coming over lol
2016-08-25 15:18:11	na_th_an	I know what you're saying
2016-08-25 15:18:12	keveloper	is that coo
2016-08-25 15:18:20	na_th_an	the gpu is in the way
2016-08-25 15:18:22	keveloper	yes
2016-08-25 15:18:23	keveloper	lol
2016-08-25 15:18:28	na_th_an	I promise you that your CPU will get cool enough air
2016-08-25 15:18:28	keveloper	can i come show you
2016-08-25 15:18:36	keveloper	so you can be like "no do it like this"
2016-08-25 15:24:55	keveloper	so i was playing minecraft for a couple minutes
2016-08-25 15:24:59	keveloper	with the best shader i can find
2016-08-25 15:25:02	keveloper	and it looked great
2016-08-25 15:25:05	keveloper	but it was 45fps
2016-08-25 15:25:19	keveloper	idk what the bottleneck is but its minecraft so im not worrying about it
2016-08-25 15:25:46	na_th_an	it's p easy to apply a moderate overclock to your CPU and GPU
2016-08-25 15:25:54	na_th_an	you certainly have the cooling for it 
2016-08-25 15:26:11	keveloper	what should I do? 400mhz?
2016-08-25 15:26:19	na_th_an	follow the flowchart!
2016-08-25 15:26:23	keveloper	lol
2016-08-25 15:26:25	keveloper	ugh
2016-08-25 15:26:36	na_th_an	https://i.imgur.com/zzwoPOS.png
2016-08-25 15:26:50	na_th_an	basically you increase the CPU multiplier by a little bit
2016-08-25 15:26:54	na_th_an	and then stress test
2016-08-25 15:26:59	na_th_an	keep doing that until it's unstable
2016-08-25 15:27:11	na_th_an	then, increase the voltage of the CPU 
2016-08-25 15:27:17	na_th_an	and try to get it stable again
2016-08-25 15:27:51	na_th_an	overclocking your graphics card is easier. You slide sliders to the right and run benchmarks until you slid too far and it crashes
2016-08-25 15:27:59	keveloper	what is vcore?
2016-08-25 15:28:07	na_th_an	vcore is the voltage for your cpu core
2016-08-25 15:28:32	keveloper	it says "VCORE to the lowest stable setting"
2016-08-25 15:28:34	na_th_an	you overclock your CPU by increasing the multiplier to increase the clock speed
2016-08-25 15:28:49	na_th_an	and you sometimes make it able to handle higher clock speeds by increasing the vcore
2016-08-25 15:29:00	keveloper	what did you use to stress test it
2016-08-25 15:29:00	na_th_an	you can probably go up 200-300mhz without increasing the vcore at all
2016-08-25 15:29:09	na_th_an	there's a version of prime95 you should use 
2016-08-25 15:29:30	na_th_an	if you just go grab the latest version, it'll make your temps like 90 degrees
2016-08-25 15:29:39	na_th_an	because it uses some workload that's bad for the 4790k
2016-08-25 15:29:48	keveloper	i want it to be 85C?
2016-08-25 15:29:51	na_th_an	there's some version of prime95 that's the correct version for stress testing on windows
2016-08-25 15:29:56	keveloper	85C is the intel limit?
2016-08-25 15:30:00	na_th_an	you probably won't hit the temp limit
2016-08-25 15:30:15	na_th_an	after overclocking my cpu hits like 75C max I think
2016-08-25 15:30:36	keveloper	the last box confuses me
2016-08-25 15:30:43	na_th_an	which one
2016-08-25 15:30:54	keveloper	"Dial your multiplier back to the highest stable settings, and your VCOR to the lowest stable setting"
2016-08-25 15:30:59	keveloper	why the lowest
2016-08-25 15:30:59	na_th_an	ok so
2016-08-25 15:31:03	na_th_an	oh
2016-08-25 15:31:09	na_th_an	you don't want to overvolt your CPU
2016-08-25 15:31:19	na_th_an	you don't wanna give it more power than it needs
2016-08-25 15:31:25	na_th_an	theoretically that'll reduce the life of the CPU
2016-08-25 15:31:36	na_th_an	more practically, it just creates more heat and uses more power for no reason
2016-08-25 15:31:52	na_th_an	you want highest multiplier and lowest voltage
2016-08-25 15:33:26	keveloper	is the 4790k a haswell chip
2016-08-25 15:33:36	na_th_an	I think so?
2016-08-25 15:33:45	na_th_an	ya
2016-08-29 08:57:52	keveloper	lol mark doesnt run
2016-08-29 08:57:58	na_th_an	lolollolol
2016-08-29 08:58:05	na_th_an	just like on his way in
2016-08-29 08:58:09	na_th_an	he hit the wall
2016-08-29 08:58:12	na_th_an	I feel like I can smell him
2016-08-29 08:58:17	na_th_an	I can smell his food at least
2016-08-29 08:58:18	keveloper	...
2016-08-29 08:58:23	na_th_an	and hear him eating it
2016-08-29 08:58:25	na_th_an	and breathing
2016-08-29 08:58:33	na_th_an	I really dont' like sitting right by him
2016-08-29 08:58:42	keveloper	when do merit increases happen
2016-08-29 08:58:51	na_th_an	I have a meeting with rashmi this week
2016-08-29 08:58:59	keveloper	have you gotten one at all
2016-08-29 08:59:06	na_th_an	you mean like before?
2016-08-29 08:59:09	keveloper	yeah
2016-08-29 08:59:16	na_th_an	no they only do it after performance reviews
2016-08-29 08:59:19	keveloper	ah
2016-08-29 08:59:20	na_th_an	or if you threaten to quit
2016-08-29 08:59:23	keveloper	lol
2016-08-29 08:59:41	keveloper	i just got a tiny from bill for "cost of living" probably because i wasnt reviewed
2016-08-29 08:59:56	na_th_an	oh that's neat
2016-08-29 09:00:03	na_th_an	but ya you probably started too late for a review
2016-08-29 09:00:06	keveloper	yeah
2016-08-29 09:00:16	keveloper	it was 1.6% aka $960
2016-08-29 09:00:19	keveloper	lol
2016-08-29 09:00:29	na_th_an	better than nothing
2016-08-29 09:00:31	keveloper	but from a review this early in career i think its like 10% or something
2016-08-29 09:00:41	na_th_an	huh
2016-08-29 09:00:57	keveloper	merit increases this early along in your career are pretty big
2016-08-29 09:00:59	keveloper	like 10%
2016-08-29 09:01:10	keveloper	my dad said it used to be 15% but probably went down
2016-08-29 09:01:29	na_th_an	oh that'd be sick
2016-08-29 09:01:49	na_th_an	I was hoping for like 5k but thinking more realistically it'd be like 3k
2016-08-29 09:01:52	keveloper	yeah it goes up fast
2016-08-29 09:02:05	keveloper	i would guess that its going to be like 5-7k
2016-08-29 09:02:18	na_th_an	if it goes up 10% that'd be like another $300/mo
2016-08-29 09:02:28	keveloper	but youve been doing like much better than other new people it seems (idk) but it'd guess 10%
2016-08-29 09:02:34	keveloper	15% would be dope
2016-08-29 09:02:38	na_th_an	yeah that'd be insanae
2016-08-29 09:02:43	keveloper	i wonder when mine will happen...
2016-08-29 09:02:43	na_th_an	that would motivate me
2016-08-29 09:02:50	keveloper	90 day review? or a full year from now
2016-08-29 09:03:14	na_th_an	they probably budget it at the beginning of the financial year
2016-08-29 09:03:15	keveloper	shouldnt my 90 day review be like now
2016-08-29 09:03:24	na_th_an	so you're probably fucked for a year
2016-08-29 09:03:26	keveloper	ohh 90 work days
2016-08-29 09:03:30	na_th_an	I never had a 90 day review
2016-08-29 09:03:36	keveloper	oh idk
2016-08-29 09:05:59	na_th_an	I am ready to snowflake
2016-08-29 09:06:06	na_th_an	teach me how
2016-08-29 09:10:43	keveloper	am sposed ta teach ya
2016-08-29 09:11:36	na_th_an	it's you and me 
2016-08-29 09:11:38	na_th_an	and idk what to do
2016-08-29 09:11:55	keveloper	okay
2016-08-29 09:11:56	keveloper	uhhh
2016-08-29 09:12:00	keveloper	do we have standup
2016-08-29 09:12:03	na_th_an	ya
2016-08-29 09:12:05	na_th_an	9:30
2016-08-29 09:12:19	na_th_an	are there any documents I can read
2016-08-29 09:12:20	keveloper	let me look at this rashmi thing
2016-08-29 09:12:21	na_th_an	or wikis
2016-08-29 09:12:23	keveloper	hold on
2016-08-29 09:12:24	keveloper	and like
2016-08-29 09:12:26	keveloper	i dont think so
2016-08-29 09:12:34	keveloper	search snowflake on sharepoint
2016-08-29 09:12:46	keveloper	youll find the snowflake coordination page or something
2016-08-29 09:13:18	keveloper	so at what point are we not supposed to talk about pay to each other lol
2016-08-29 09:13:25	na_th_an	idk
2016-08-29 09:13:27	keveloper	because im very curious what your increase is gonna be
2016-08-29 09:13:29	na_th_an	idc
2016-08-29 09:13:37	keveloper	because it'll probably be similar to mine
2016-08-29 09:13:50	keveloper	my next one is what i meant
2016-08-29 09:13:52	na_th_an	the point you stop talking about it is when it affects your work
2016-08-29 09:13:59	keveloper	i guess so lol
2016-08-29 09:14:03	na_th_an	bc you're mad that someone else makes more than you
2016-08-29 09:14:10	na_th_an	maybe that's what happened to eric
2016-08-29 09:14:14	keveloper	i think i'll understand if you make more than me
2016-08-29 09:14:21	na_th_an	he made less so he didn't think he had to do anything
2016-08-29 09:14:24	keveloper	you should make more than me lol
2016-08-29 09:14:53	na_th_an	so how do we know what products of ours are in what groups
2016-08-29 09:15:08	na_th_an	and I don't really feel like I should bc of my 5 months of experience extra
2016-08-29 09:15:19	na_th_an	but life isn't fair and I'll let them
2016-08-29 09:15:20	keveloper	no i mean just because you know more
2016-08-29 09:15:23	keveloper	and can do more proably
2016-08-29 09:15:27	na_th_an	I don't feel like I do
2016-08-29 09:15:36	keveloper	idk lol
2016-08-29 09:15:45	keveloper	uhh there's an epic somewhere
2016-08-29 09:15:52	na_th_an	I can find that
2016-08-29 09:16:06	keveloper	for dev or nit
2016-08-29 09:16:20	keveloper	doesnt matter the epic is for all of them
2016-08-29 09:16:35	keveloper	https://jira.oclc.org/browse/DA-20853
2016-08-29 09:17:25	na_th_an	have you done anything with PRT yet
2016-08-29 09:17:43	keveloper	yeah
2016-08-29 09:17:45	keveloper	sorta
2016-08-29 09:17:49	keveloper	im starting owcc

2016-08-31 14:50:55	na_th_an	she recommended 2%

2016-08-31 14:51:03	na_th_an	because it was pro-rated
2016-08-31 14:51:13	beefnprokboi	i got 1.6
2016-08-31 14:51:26	beefnprokboi	maybe because you havent been here for a year?
2016-08-31 14:51:44	beefnprokboi	so um
2016-08-31 14:51:46	beefnprokboi	...

2016-08-31 14:52:20	beefnprokboi	but still
2016-08-31 14:52:26	na_th_an	so I get a smaller merit increase than you got for living expenses?
2016-08-31 14:52:30	na_th_an	after a positive performance review
2016-08-31 14:52:35	na_th_an	that makes sense
2016-08-31 14:52:48	beefnprokboi	1) get an offer elsewhere
2016-08-31 14:52:53	beefnprokboi	2) make OCLC counter
2016-08-31 14:52:56	na_th_an	I'm starting to consider searching for other jobs
2016-08-31 14:52:57	beefnprokboi	3) if the counter sucks, leave
2016-08-31 14:52:58	na_th_an	honestly
2016-08-31 14:53:02	beefnprokboi	me too lol
2016-08-31 14:53:04	na_th_an	although haley might go to grad school
2016-08-31 14:53:11	na_th_an	and if she does I should just stay here until she does
2016-08-31 14:53:14	na_th_an	but like
2016-08-31 14:53:14	beefnprokboi	keep in mind our benefits are kinda dop

2016-08-31 14:53:24	beefnprokboi	yeah
2016-08-31 14:53:25	beefnprokboi	that
2016-08-31 14:53:38	na_th_an	I do not feel like our team is being managed well
2016-08-31 14:53:44	na_th_an	by our managers all the way to skip
2016-08-31 14:53:51	beefnprokboi	yeah
2016-08-31 14:53:55	beefnprokboi	...
2016-08-31 14:53:59	beefnprokboi	go work at stack overflow
2016-08-31 14:54:03	beefnprokboi	im like... 87% serious
2016-08-31 14:54:06	beefnprokboi	you could wfh
2016-08-31 14:54:07	na_th_an	I was hoping I'd get a pay increase and be like "oh okay I can do snowflake now that I'm getting paid more"
2016-08-31 14:54:13	na_th_an	but this was very demotivating
2016-08-31 14:54:22	beefnprokboi	yeah i thought for sure you'd get like 10% or something
2016-08-31 14:54:28	beefnprokboi	...
2016-08-31 14:54:32	beefnprokboi	maybe because it hasnt been 12 monts?
2016-08-31 14:54:34	beefnprokboi	months*
2016-08-31 14:54:36	beefnprokboi	i can see that
2016-08-31 14:54:42	na_th_an	W wasn't kidding when he said that hard work doesn't pay off here
2016-08-31 14:54:50	beefnprokboi	lol
2016-08-31 14:54:52	beefnprokboi	did he say that
2016-08-31 14:54:55	na_th_an	and that not doing work rarely has negative consequences
2016-08-31 14:55:04	beefnprokboi	thats definitely true
2016-08-31 14:55:12	na_th_an	well if it was 12 months I'd have gotten the 2%
2016-08-31 14:55:14	beefnprokboi	mark was asleep earlier
2016-08-31 14:55:26	beefnprokboi	how much does mark get paid
2016-08-31 14:55:31	na_th_an	100k+
2016-08-31 14:55:33	beefnprokboi	we could both do what mark does if we were trained for a week
2016-08-31 14:55:34	na_th_an	easily
2016-08-31 14:55:38	na_th_an	and faster
2016-08-31 14:55:49	beefnprokboi	...
2016-08-31 14:57:39	beefnprokboi	so the only possible thing I can imagine is that you can't by oclc rules because it hasnt been 12 months or something
2016-08-31 14:57:54	beefnprokboi	my dad said it used to be like 10% a year or something
2016-08-31 14:58:08	beefnprokboi	quinton says i can get a battelle job pretty easily...
2016-08-31 14:58:18	beefnprokboi	he's gonna be making like 70k right out of college 
2016-08-31 14:58:27	beefnprokboi	he said close to 70 is what his recruiter says
2016-08-31 14:58:42	beefnprokboi	so if I went there I would just be like "77k"
2016-08-31 14:58:51	beefnprokboi	and they'd be like "73k" and i'd be like deal
2016-08-31 14:59:02	beefnprokboi	then id come to oclc and be like give me "72k" or im leaving
2016-08-31 14:59:06	beefnprokboi	is my ideal situation lol
2016-08-31 14:59:22	na_th_an	yeah that's pretty much what you have to do
2016-08-31 14:59:27	na_th_an	because loyalty (obviously) isn't rewarded
2016-08-31 14:59:32	beefnprokboi	yep
2016-08-31 14:59:32	na_th_an	fuck you rashmi
2016-08-31 14:59:39	na_th_an	do you know what the job market is like for ppl that can actually code
2016-08-31 14:59:44	beefnprokboi	lol
2016-08-31 14:59:53	beefnprokboi	i could have like 4 jobs by now
2016-08-31 15:00:19	na_th_an	I really don't want to hate my job but OCLC isn't doing a good job making me not hate coming to work
2016-08-31 15:00:26	beefnprokboi	yeah
2016-08-31 15:00:31	beefnprokboi	snowflake sucks
2016-08-31 15:00:34	na_th_an	yup
2016-08-31 15:00:44	beefnprokboi	good performance review = 1.5% raise LOL

2016-08-31 15:00:54	beefnprokboi	i thought you were joking when you said that

2016-08-31 15:01:27	beefnprokboi	because fair
2016-08-31 15:01:29	beefnprokboi	and because rashmi
2016-08-31 15:01:31	beefnprokboi	fuck OCLC
2016-08-31 15:03:08	na_th_an	I wonder how much more OCLC was paying that shitty contractor that I replaced
2016-08-31 15:03:19	beefnprokboi	i know right
2016-08-31 15:03:30	beefnprokboi	yeah the thing is no one will ever go out of their way to give you more money
2016-08-31 15:03:33	na_th_an	I would feel better if I got no increase at all
2016-08-31 15:03:36	beefnprokboi	i know right
2016-08-31 15:03:50	beefnprokboi	if they were like "we arent going to increase you until 12 months so we can give you a bigger increase"
2016-08-31 15:03:52	beefnprokboi	or something like that
2016-08-31 15:04:32	beefnprokboi	my friend who got a pretty good deal by getting a job at AnF then AnF and 30 lines got in a bidding war made like +15k out of it
2016-08-31 15:04:41	beefnprokboi	and he said "just dont be a pussy" lol when talking about it
2016-08-31 15:04:50	beefnprokboi	basically just over value yourself
2016-08-31 15:04:59	beefnprokboi	and they will talk down to as high as they are comfortable with
2016-08-31 15:05:02	beefnprokboi	and you say great
2016-08-31 15:05:18	beefnprokboi	i shouldve looked at the 60k on that offer and been like "no no no"
2016-08-31 15:05:22	na_th_an	I would feel better about it if ppl who made more than me were answering my technical questions

2016-08-31 15:07:14	beefnprokboi	does she think we would believe that?
2016-08-31 15:07:15	na_th_an	that some people have
2016-08-31 15:07:19	na_th_an	and she does every single thing I read about
2016-08-31 15:07:33	beefnprokboi	you shouldve been like "i completely disagree with that view of the job market"
2016-08-31 15:08:00	beefnprokboi	If Bill did that to me I would definitely vocalize or signal my feelings about it
2016-08-31 15:08:20	beefnprokboi	I'd be like "1.5%? My performance review was good right?.... Okay..."
2016-08-31 15:08:22	beefnprokboi	and give a weird look
2016-08-31 15:08:33	beefnprokboi	"I was expecting much more"
2016-08-31 15:08:34	na_th_an	it's not like it would change anything
2016-08-31 15:08:41	na_th_an	and she'd just think I'm pissed off
2016-08-31 15:08:44	na_th_an	I don't think it'd help

2016-08-31 15:09:11	na_th_an	and I'm like "uhh,, good?"
2016-08-31 15:09:14	beefnprokboi	"Like OCLC has no money"
2016-08-31 15:09:15	na_th_an	she's like "You're so hard to read!"
2016-08-31 15:09:18	na_th_an	like do I fucking look happy
2016-08-31 15:09:29	na_th_an	there's a reason I never show emotion around you
2016-08-31 15:09:36	na_th_an	it's because I don't want to look visibly pissed off
2016-08-31 15:09:41	na_th_an	and that's all you ever do to me
2016-08-31 15:09:44	beefnprokboi	"If a good performance review results in a 1.5% pay raise then I'm looking for a new job"
2016-08-31 15:09:53	na_th_an	yeah... basically
2016-08-31 15:09:55	beefnprokboi	jk i wouldnt say that unless I had an offer

2016-08-31 15:10:15	na_th_an	yeah same
2016-08-31 15:10:22	beefnprokboi	4 months than gone is not good
2016-08-31 15:10:33	beefnprokboi	and "unfair compensation" is not a good reason to give to the next employer

2016-08-31 16:49:21	na_th_an	I can picture in my next one on one being like "so I looked it up, and with inflation I'm really making the same amount as I was when I started, but now I have more experience and a positive performance review. I guess, it doesn't feel like my efforts are being rewarded, since cost of living adjustments are usually made to keep up with inflation anyway"
2016-08-31 16:49:31	na_th_an	and her giving me some big manager speech
2016-08-31 16:49:35	na_th_an	and I'd have nothing to say

2016-09-01 10:00:11	na_th_an	and I get things handed to me when people two pay grades above me are too busy to do them
2016-09-01 10:00:14	keveloper	that job market isnt good right now
2016-09-01 10:00:25	na_th_an	but don't deserve a standard cost of living increase
2016-09-01 10:00:29	keveloper	people arent jumping job to job every 2 years anymore
2016-09-01 10:00:35	na_th_an	I'm seriously considering bringing this up in my next one and one with her
2016-09-01 10:00:39	keveloper	lol
2016-09-01 10:00:43	na_th_an	saying "this is a standard cost of living increase"
2016-09-01 10:00:43	keveloper	what would you say
2016-09-01 10:00:55	na_th_an	"this is the average OSU CSE graduate salary" (they are below average)
2016-09-01 10:01:01	na_th_an	you're already paying me below average
2016-09-01 10:01:08	na_th_an	and my merit increase was less than inflation
2016-09-01 10:01:13	keveloper	was it?
2016-09-01 10:01:16	na_th_an	when I have all these positive comments in my performance review
2016-09-01 10:01:25	keveloper	no it was
2016-09-01 10:01:28	keveloper	.82%
2016-09-01 10:01:29	keveloper	wasnt*
2016-09-01 10:01:32	na_th_an	your cost of living increase was higher than my "merit" increase
2016-09-01 10:01:38	keveloper	well you cant say that
2016-09-01 10:01:41	na_th_an	cost of living maybe we'll see what I could find
2016-09-01 10:01:46	na_th_an	ya I won't
2016-09-01 10:01:55	na_th_an	look at CPI or something
2016-09-01 10:02:14	na_th_an	but I can make a decent argument that I'm undervalued
2016-09-01 10:02:29	na_th_an	and that my positive performance review doesn't really match with the merit increase I got
2016-09-01 10:02:36	keveloper	yeah

2016-09-01 10:02:50	keveloper	"i reommended 2%" oh wowww 2%!
2016-09-01 10:02:54	keveloper	lol thats also a joke
2016-09-01 10:03:10	na_th_an	"I feel like I'm being taken advantage of, being paid a junior developer and being handed tasks that senior developers were doing. Like it says in my performance review. Like the IDM migration that was handed to me from a tech lead."
2016-09-01 10:03:18	na_th_an	"Like the POC that was handed to me from an expensive contractor"
2016-09-01 10:03:36	na_th_an	it's not like she'll fire me or pay me less
2016-09-01 10:04:24	keveloper	yeah
2016-09-01 10:04:40	na_th_an	and it's not like I won't get a raise next year by mentioning it
2016-09-01 10:04:47	na_th_an	bc the raises are shit anyway apparently
2016-09-01 10:04:47	keveloper	"it makes me want to go find a company who will value me more appropriately"
2016-09-01 10:05:09	na_th_an	I should ahev some job market statistics ready

2016-09-01 10:06:05	na_th_an	it might be at least worth bringing up

2016-09-01 10:07:00	keveloper	just say "can you find out when it will be for sure"
2016-09-01 10:07:41	keveloper	like she was trying to give paul critism about his status
2016-09-01 10:07:44	keveloper	like fuck off rashmi

2016-09-01 12:47:42	keveloper	"I mean the code always does what you tell it to, its just what you want it to do and what you tell it do arent the same thing lol"
2016-09-01 12:47:46	na_th_an	"obviously he's just a better programmer than you"

2016-09-06 13:08:03	keveloper	instead of kick ball lol
2016-09-06 13:08:11	keveloper	real question: can you run through first base
2016-09-06 13:08:14	na_th_an	ya mat ball iis sick
2016-09-06 13:08:17	na_th_an	probably

2016-09-06 13:08:37	na_th_an	lol
2016-09-06 13:08:55	keveloper	its so that you can sprint as fast as you possibly can to get to first base
2016-09-06 13:08:59	keveloper	and not worry about slowing down
2016-09-06 13:09:05	na_th_an	ya it's just kinda weird
2016-09-06 13:09:06	na_th_an	I get it

2016-09-06 13:09:22	na_th_an	just kinda weird
2016-09-06 13:09:34	na_th_an	like when does it become running to 2nd vs slowing down
2016-09-06 13:09:39	keveloper	i tried to run through first one time in t-ball and got out
2016-09-06 13:09:44	keveloper	because apparently thats not a thing in t-ball

2016-09-07 13:14:30	na_th_an	yup
2016-09-07 13:14:44	na_th_an	I see why talented developers leave
2016-09-07 13:15:57	keveloper	grade 15 pay range maximum is 76k
2016-09-07 13:16:21	na_th_an	I don't think anyone gets there
2016-09-07 13:16:29	na_th_an	at least you wouldn't by merit increase unless you really suck
2016-09-07 13:17:23	keveloper	grade 21 is 125k to 209k
2016-09-07 13:17:38	keveloper	does that mean skip makes 209k
2016-09-07 13:18:07	na_th_an	I doubt skip is a 'grade'
2016-09-07 13:18:12	na_th_an	he signed a contract as CEO
2016-09-07 13:18:19	na_th_an	gets whatever is in that contract
2016-09-07 13:18:30	keveloper	i wonder what that is
2016-09-07 13:18:33	keveloper	250k?
2016-09-07 13:18:39	na_th_an	idk
2016-09-07 13:18:49	keveloper	i just cant imagine his job warranting 250k/yr
2016-09-07 13:18:51	na_th_an	I'd /think/ that would be public information because we're a nonprofit
2016-09-07 13:18:52	na_th_an	maybe
2016-09-07 13:18:58	na_th_an	execs make a lot of money
2016-09-07 13:19:09	na_th_an	wouldn't surprise me if he was ~400k
2016-09-07 13:19:41	keveloper	that just doesnt make that much sense
2016-09-07 13:19:54	na_th_an	ideally the exec brings in more value than he's paid
2016-09-07 13:21:11	keveloper	so...
2016-09-07 13:21:27	keveloper	the pay range midpoint is 60,970
2016-09-07 13:21:34	na_th_an	ya I saw that lol
2016-09-07 13:21:34	keveloper	we both make less than that
2016-09-07 13:21:38	na_th_an	wait
2016-09-07 13:21:40	na_th_an	for what
2016-09-07 13:21:44	keveloper	grade 15 salary
2016-09-07 13:21:47	na_th_an	oh
2016-09-07 13:22:06	keveloper	we are both apparently less than average developers
2016-09-07 13:22:09	na_th_an	ya
2016-09-07 13:22:30	keveloper	...
2016-09-07 13:22:52	keveloper	leahhh
2016-09-07 13:23:14	na_th_an	I doubt your pay would be much/any different on SS
2016-09-07 13:23:23	keveloper	i could renogtiate totally
2016-09-07 13:24:13	keveloper	i still dont get
2016-09-07 13:24:16	keveloper	i just dont get it
2016-09-07 13:24:42	na_th_an	they just don't have proper processes in place for compensating good developers here it seems
2016-09-07 13:24:49	keveloper	^
2016-09-07 13:25:04	na_th_an	and the processes they do have breeds mediocrity
2016-09-07 13:25:12	keveloper	yes
2016-09-07 13:28:56	keveloper	"I feel valued as an employee of OCLC"
2016-09-07 13:28:58	keveloper	lol
2016-09-07 13:29:10	na_th_an	"Skip, having been through the recent merit increase process I am very dismayed. The merit increases available to managers are too small to encourage employees to work hard for more compensation. When I started, I was told that working hard at OCLC won't do much for you besides get you put on worse projects, and slacking off doesn't have much consequences. I was hoping they were kidding, but it's becoming
2016-09-07 13:29:11	na_th_an	more and more obvious they weren't. OCLC's promotion structure currently breeds mediocrity and complacency. I think this is a major reason why you see so few young people on the 4th floor of the Kilgour building."
2016-09-07 13:32:37	keveloper	"I feel my pay is competetive compared to people doing similar jobs in other companies" uhhhh strongly disagree
2016-09-07 13:32:58	na_th_an	I *really* should have waited to do the survey
2016-09-07 13:33:02	na_th_an	I did it the day before my merit increase
2016-09-07 13:33:06	na_th_an	stupidly
2016-09-07 13:33:26	keveloper	yeah
2016-09-07 13:33:32	keveloper	and are doing that ask skip
2016-09-07 13:33:37	na_th_an	I will
2016-09-07 13:33:49	na_th_an	idk exactly what I'm gonna say but something along those lines
2016-09-07 13:33:56	keveloper	yaeh
2016-09-07 13:34:34	keveloper	what do i like most about working at OCLC
2016-09-07 13:34:35	keveloper	...
2016-09-07 13:34:38	keveloper	coworkers?
2016-09-07 13:34:39	keveloper	i think
2016-09-07 13:34:56	na_th_an	I like Groovy
2016-09-07 13:34:57	na_th_an	put Groovy
2016-09-07 13:35:00	keveloper	lolol
2016-09-07 13:35:09	keveloper	"Uh... coding?"
2016-09-07 13:35:10	na_th_an	"groovy is a great language that not a lot of companies use"
2016-09-07 13:35:17	na_th_an	charles said some good stuff about groovy
2016-09-07 13:35:29	na_th_an	he's like "I see some groovy in there?" and we're ilke "ya" and he's like "sweet"
2016-09-07 13:35:34	na_th_an	he likes groovy (obv)
2016-09-07 13:38:09	keveloper	for "I feel valued" I put disagree
2016-09-07 13:38:18	keveloper	and for the competetive compensation one I put strongly disagree
2016-09-07 13:38:47	keveloper	In the other thing the end i shouldve put
2016-09-07 13:39:39	keveloper	"I could leave OCLC right now and get a job with a much better salary at a place that might value me more correctly, but the only thing keeping me from doing that is having a 4 month employer on my resume" lol
2016-09-07 13:42:54	na_th_an	I think managers can read these
2016-09-07 13:43:01	na_th_an	your name isn't on them
2016-09-07 13:43:19	na_th_an	but like, bill will get a batch of them
2016-09-07 13:54:53	keveloper	did we all get a different username
2016-09-07 13:54:59	keveloper	like how would they organize that
2016-09-07 13:55:07	na_th_an	ya we all got a diff username
2016-09-07 13:55:21	keveloper	ah okay
2016-09-07 13:55:29	na_th_an	I'm sure someone has a way to look up what survey came from which person
2016-09-07 13:57:19	keveloper	:O gasp
2016-09-07 13:57:53	keveloper	na_th_an so what live integration tests have you fixed
2016-09-07 13:58:03	na_th_an	I think the live integration tests are done for rn
2016-09-07 13:58:08	keveloper	okay
2016-09-07 13:58:09	keveloper	mock time
2016-09-07 13:58:10	keveloper	what do
2016-09-07 13:58:11	na_th_an	unless you can figure out the gzip ones that sometimes get a 500
2016-09-07 13:58:15	na_th_an	not mock
2016-09-07 13:58:18	na_th_an	geb-spock-canned
2016-09-07 13:58:29	na_th_an	mock integration happens w/ a build
2016-09-07 13:58:44	keveloper	canned
2016-09-07 13:58:48	keveloper	i know
2016-09-07 13:59:01	keveloper	whats going on with the other 3
2016-09-07 13:59:05	keveloper	the marc stuff is 2 of 5 failures
2016-09-07 13:59:16	na_th_an	the ILR thing has a ticket for it I think 
2016-09-07 13:59:18	na_th_an	I'm trying to find it
2016-09-07 13:59:25	na_th_an	so I can inform the team in skype of what's up with it
2016-09-07 13:59:36	na_th_an	IlrLinkResolutionSpec is a legit fail
2016-09-07 13:59:40	keveloper	What about this IOException thing
2016-09-07 13:59:50	keveloper	Like a bug or data or what?
2016-09-07 14:00:03	na_th_an	DA-21654 
2016-09-07 14:00:12	na_th_an	is preventing the test from passing
2016-09-07 14:00:28	keveloper	coo
2016-09-07 14:16:26	keveloper	okay
2016-09-07 14:16:29	keveloper	canned idk what to do
2016-09-07 14:16:33	keveloper	how do you do the record thing
2016-09-07 14:16:35	keveloper	can you run them local
2016-09-07 14:17:03	na_th_an	http://disctrsap01dxdu.dev.oclc.org:8080/trs2ui/discoveryui/switch
2016-09-07 14:17:05	na_th_an	that's the recorder
2016-09-07 14:17:10	na_th_an	you can run them local
2016-09-07 14:17:18	na_th_an	what I do is fix them against CI
2016-09-07 14:17:29	na_th_an	then run against the canned server and it should break again
2016-09-07 14:17:33	na_th_an	then re-record and it should fix them
2016-09-07 14:22:55	keveloper	so what should i look at
2016-09-07 14:22:58	keveloper	what are you looking at
2016-09-07 14:23:01	keveloper	so we dont do the same stuff
2016-09-07 14:23:17	na_th_an	I'm going down the list and fixing any MethodMissing or element not clickable at point because other element would receive the click errors
2016-09-07 14:23:26	na_th_an	bc those are (basically) my fault

2016-09-07 14:35:31	na_th_an	we can't merge and re-run w/o some kind of approval tho
2016-09-07 14:35:45	na_th_an	there's lower standards for the test modules
2016-09-07 14:35:59	na_th_an	I don't think zach would really care if we just merged the branch ourselves
2016-09-07 14:36:00	na_th_an	we could ask
2016-09-07 14:36:27	na_th_an	ok just pushed the test-fixes branch

2016-09-08 09:20:20	keveloper	see
2016-09-08 09:20:37	keveloper	this is what happens when we cherry pick shit for release
2016-09-08 09:21:05	keveloper	we cant even be sure that what was in master on the last release is in production
2016-09-08 09:21:21	na_th_an	yeah this is kinda fucking ridiculous
2016-09-08 09:21:29	na_th_an	tbf zach prematurely merged the idm shit 
2016-09-08 09:21:30	keveloper	why was the idm thing ever merged anyway
2016-09-08 09:21:36	keveloper	yeah
2016-09-08 09:21:44	na_th_an	he was like "oh we have two approvers merged!"
2016-09-08 09:22:09	keveloper	we should merge into a verification branch or something so that cant happen
2016-09-08 10:23:11	keveloper	i just got a linked in message about a Java dev job at DHL
2016-09-08 10:23:13	keveloper	in polaris
2016-09-08 10:23:19	na_th_an	lol
2016-09-08 10:23:25	na_th_an	this job market man
2016-09-08 10:23:45	keveloper	java and python apparently
2016-09-08 10:37:25	keveloper	halp
2016-09-08 10:37:35	keveloper	this works on hold DR
2016-09-08 10:37:35	keveloper	http://avlfulws02dxm1.dev.oclc.org:8080/webservices/delivery/decoratedAvailability?oclcNumber=11090307&registryId=2315&showLocal=true&debug=&referrerAddress=132.174.23.226
2016-09-08 10:37:39	keveloper	but not new
2016-09-08 10:42:39	keveloper	so DR looks like it was done wrong
2016-09-08 10:42:44	keveloper	and the health checks probably suck
2016-09-08 10:44:10	na_th_an	idk 
2016-09-08 10:44:16	na_th_an	I'd guess the health checks suck
2016-09-08 10:44:16	keveloper	http://git.ent.oclc.org/projects/DISC/repos/deliveryresolver/browse/delivery-resolver-webapp/src/main/resources/config/dr.properties.dev
2016-09-08 10:44:25	keveloper	those first 5 URLs I think are wrong
2016-09-08 10:44:42	na_th_an	*shrug* I didn't do them
2016-09-08 10:45:27	na_th_an	charles' monitors are connected by VGA :O
2016-09-08 10:45:29	na_th_an	poor guy
2016-09-08 10:45:37	keveloper	:O
2016-09-08 10:45:39	keveloper	tell him
2016-09-08 10:45:50	na_th_an	I'm sure he knows
2016-09-08 10:45:51	keveloper	can VGA do 1080
2016-09-08 10:45:54	na_th_an	ya
2016-09-08 10:45:57	na_th_an	VGA can do a lot 
2016-09-08 10:46:04	keveloper	60Hz?
2016-09-08 10:46:06	na_th_an	ya
2016-09-08 10:46:11	na_th_an	it can do like 2k 60hz or something
2016-09-08 10:46:11	keveloper	so whats wrong then
2016-09-08 10:46:18	na_th_an	it's analog signal
2016-09-08 10:46:20	keveloper	so
2016-09-08 10:46:20	na_th_an	not as good
2016-09-08 10:46:27	keveloper	what isn't as good about
2016-09-08 10:46:27	na_th_an	digital looks better
2016-09-08 10:46:34	keveloper	what do you mean it looks better
2016-09-08 10:46:36	na_th_an	it's a better signal
2016-09-08 10:46:48	keveloper	but it can do 1080 60Hz whats the difference
2016-09-08 10:47:08	na_th_an	it looks better
2016-09-08 10:47:11	na_th_an	because the signal is better
2016-09-08 10:47:16	keveloper	what is better about it?
2016-09-08 10:47:18	na_th_an	there is 0 loss in a digital signal
2016-09-08 10:47:18	keveloper	its sharper?
2016-09-08 10:47:20	na_th_an	ya
2016-09-08 10:47:45	na_th_an	digital connections are better for video than analog
2016-09-08 10:48:00	keveloper	shit like this i dont understand
2016-09-08 10:48:00	na_th_an	that's why literally every video thing has gone digital
2016-09-08 10:48:01	keveloper	REGISTRY_HOST=phwsdev01.dev.oclc.org:16000
2016-09-08 10:48:06	keveloper	phwsdev01 is Placehold
2016-09-08 10:48:17	keveloper	why is the name "REGISTRY_HOST"
2016-09-08 10:48:20	keveloper	doesnt make any sense
2016-09-08 10:48:24	na_th_an	who the fuck knows
2016-09-08 10:48:27	na_th_an	not us
2016-09-08 10:48:32	na_th_an	but we have to do it anyway
2016-09-08 10:48:32	keveloper	shit like that is everywhere
2016-09-08 10:48:42	keveloper	and then right after that is
2016-09-08 10:48:42	keveloper	PLACEHOLD_HOST=delivresws01dxdu.dev.oclc.org:16467

2016-09-08 11:07:47	na_th_an	idk some dumb meeting with rashmi probably
2016-09-08 12:23:51	na_th_an	why did mark not eat here
2016-09-08 12:24:23	keveloper	he wanted to eat before he ate
2016-09-08 12:24:38	na_th_an	lolololl
2016-09-08 13:27:01	na_th_an	"I'm going to go back again. I'm waiting because I'm already done with my pop so I have to go get another pop to eat more cookies" - Mark
2016-09-08 15:34:11	na_th_an	so what should I talk to katy about
2016-09-08 15:34:20	na_th_an	"rashmi is always on her phone and it's really rude"
2016-09-08 15:34:38	na_th_an	"also what is the promotion path for new developers, because obviously merit increases are not it"
2016-09-08 15:42:02	keveloper	lol
2016-09-08 15:42:03	keveloper	idk man
2016-09-08 15:42:09	keveloper	i would try to be positive

2016-09-08 15:42:19	na_th_an	I'm not gonna be like "I'm fucking pissed off"
2016-09-08 15:42:32	na_th_an	after seeing the manager document I realize that OCLC's merit increases are just not merit increases
2016-09-08 15:42:41	na_th_an	they're basically just annual slight increases
2016-09-08 15:42:45	na_th_an	that have no bearing on merit
2016-09-08 15:43:01	na_th_an	I assume that 'real' raises come when you change grades
2016-09-08 15:43:05	na_th_an	if that ever happens
2016-09-08 15:43:17	keveloper	would it be in bad taste to my this instagram caption "half a year later and she's not sick of my yet" with a glasses smiley emoji lol
2016-09-08 15:43:24	na_th_an	no
2016-09-08 15:43:26	keveloper	lol okay

2016-09-08 15:46:35	keveloper	$10 he has some jars messing with the class path
2016-09-08 15:46:42	keveloper	i bet they have some isoftone jar or something
2016-09-08 15:46:45	keveloper	in the project
2016-09-08 15:47:21	na_th_an	Has any one looked at this JAR file for comparability with Ubiquity?
2016-09-08 15:47:28	na_th_an	garyshurgin--
2016-09-08 15:47:36	na_th_an	I have a very negative opinion of him
2016-09-08 15:49:25	keveloper	i dont even know what that means
2016-09-08 15:49:42	keveloper	also "I am getting an error from this JAR:" *pastes exception*
2016-09-08 15:49:55	keveloper	Not even, thats like part of a stack trace
2016-09-08 15:50:34	keveloper	that jar is coming from ubiquity though
2016-09-08 15:51:28	keveloper	Oh jk I think its isoft

2016-09-08 16:26:43	na_th_an	I mentioned how she does it at standup, during meetings, and has missed things we've said because of it
2016-09-08 16:26:56	na_th_an	apparently jim miller told a bunch of ppl the other day to stop looking at their shit
2016-09-08 16:27:06	na_th_an	because they were in a meeting with a vendor and somebody kept looking at their iWatch
2016-09-08 16:27:12	na_th_an	apple watch

2016-09-09 08:52:48	keveloper	imagine if you got paid to play RL
2016-09-09 08:52:50	keveloper	8 hours a day
2016-09-09 08:52:52	keveloper	and make $60k
2016-09-09 09:00:40	keveloper	i wonder how much money the top twitch streamer makes
2016-09-09 09:01:41	keveloper	Michael Santana — better known as “Imaqtpie” — has reported over $8,000 from streaming in just one month. 
2016-09-09 09:01:49	na_th_an	I wonder what the top male and female streamers are
2016-09-09 09:01:50	keveloper	As one of the most popular streamers on Twitch, his broadcasts often net anywhere from 18,000-40,000 live viewers and his channel has seen over 83 million collective views
2016-09-09 09:02:13	na_th_an	I initially started typing "strippers" instead of "streamers"
2016-09-09 09:02:25	keveloper	If a streamer with 2,000 concurrent viewers and $1.00 eCPM runs three commercials per hour and streams for eight hours a day, five days a week, they can earn about $240 a week or $960 a month from advertising revenue. However, a popular streamer with 20,000 concurrent viewers and $2.00 eCPM on the same schedule would make $40/hour or $1600/week or $6400/month.
2016-09-09 09:02:59	na_th_an	you going for it?
2016-09-09 09:03:01	na_th_an	go for it

2016-09-09 09:03:06	keveloper	no
2016-09-09 09:03:19	keveloper	That'd be nice side income if I could do it
2016-09-09 09:03:25	keveloper	I doubt I could get viewers
2016-09-09 09:03:30	keveloper	I can't talk enough to keep people interested lol
2016-09-09 09:03:36	na_th_an	I had like 10 that one night

2016-09-09 09:04:05	na_th_an	I got a better camera
2016-09-09 09:04:10	keveloper	If you have 10 subscribers thats like $40 a month or something lol
2016-09-09 09:04:10	na_th_an	and made it go faster
2016-09-09 09:04:28	keveloper	made what go faster
2016-09-09 09:04:39	na_th_an	the recording
2016-09-09 09:04:51	na_th_an	it was encoding the video with the cpu for some dumb reason by default
2016-09-09 09:04:54	na_th_an	so it was stuttering
2016-09-09 09:04:57	na_th_an	now it uses the gpu
2016-09-09 09:04:59	na_th_an	v fast now

2016-09-09 09:08:38	keveloper	and started building
2016-09-09 09:08:39	na_th_an	:O
2016-09-09 09:08:49	keveloper	so now i have all of their deleted blocks and shit
2016-09-09 09:09:01	keveloper	i built 2 parking lots and a little park thing and an entry way to a building
2016-09-09 09:09:02	na_th_an	use the world editor
2016-09-09 09:09:10	keveloper	that would not help me lol
2016-09-09 09:09:11	na_th_an	to copy the shit you made into the real one
2016-09-09 09:09:13	keveloper	oh
2016-09-09 09:09:13	keveloper	yeah
2016-09-09 09:09:15	keveloper	i could try
2016-09-09 09:09:21	keveloper	its all on my server though
2016-09-09 09:09:23	keveloper	so no GUI
2016-09-09 09:09:27	keveloper	i'd have to like scp it lol

2016-09-09 09:09:33	na_th_an	ez
2016-09-09 09:09:38	na_th_an	eznp
2016-09-09 09:09:41	keveloper	ya just kinda annoying idk
2016-09-09 09:09:49	keveloper	i might use a world building to flatten shit
2016-09-09 09:09:53	keveloper	because it looks bad
2016-09-09 09:10:08	keveloper	the city just kinda of stops then there's like a 30 block wall
2016-09-09 09:10:16	na_th_an	lol
2016-09-09 09:10:16	keveloper	of dirt
2016-09-09 09:10:30	na_th_an	do it
2016-09-09 09:10:37	keveloper	and as I expand the city I slowly get rid of the wall and terraform using world edit in game (which isnt very effective)
2016-09-09 09:10:57	keveloper	i want someone to play with me
2016-09-09 09:11:03	keveloper	and build with me
2016-09-09 09:11:10	keveloper	but no one wants to lol

2016-09-09 09:15:05	na_th_an	the fuck do we need a catcher for
2016-09-09 09:15:15	keveloper	to catch when people miss the ball
2016-09-09 09:15:17	na_th_an	I guess to be at home

2016-09-09 09:17:55	keveloper	if i have the chance to win i will chip the ball straight up so someone will catch and we will lose (oops)
2016-09-09 09:18:04	na_th_an	ya I'm here to lose
2016-09-09 11:02:49	keveloper	zach with the itchy trigger finger again
2016-09-09 14:42:25	keveloper	abby on phone
2016-09-09 14:42:39	keveloper	she's on instagram
2016-09-09 14:42:40	na_th_an	duh
2016-09-09 14:42:43	keveloper	remember how she wants to be dev
2016-09-09 14:42:55	na_th_an	idk man

2016-09-09 15:00:10	keveloper	not fall asleep
2016-09-09 15:00:30	na_th_an	it makes your sleep really bad
2016-09-09 15:00:34	na_th_an	because you have no oxygen
2016-09-09 15:00:38	keveloper	oh ok
2016-09-09 15:00:39	na_th_an	so you fall asleep all day
2016-09-09 15:00:41	keveloper	ya
2016-09-09 15:53:00	keveloper	what was up with rashmi's speech about ownership or whatever
2016-09-09 15:53:07	keveloper	and then started talking about like
2016-09-09 15:53:10	keveloper	storing data or something
2016-09-09 15:53:14	na_th_an	idk
2016-09-09 15:53:16	keveloper	i was like wtf are you talking about
2016-09-09 15:53:29	keveloper	what else was she talking about
2016-09-09 15:53:36	keveloper	something about how the defect happened
2016-09-09 15:53:36	na_th_an	how our thing literally did not work
2016-09-09 15:53:59	keveloper	yeah she seems confused about what the defect is
2016-09-09 15:54:08	na_th_an	I'm a little mad at abby for spending 10 minutes testing that ticket and saying it's fine
2016-09-09 15:54:10	na_th_an	then going back to reddit
2016-09-09 15:54:14	keveloper	yeah
2016-09-09 15:54:18	na_th_an	and then it literally not worknig with the DC settings at all
2016-09-09 15:54:36	keveloper	whatever bullshit she was talking about about the big picture or something
2016-09-09 15:54:43	keveloper	i was like no someone just didnt test it enough
2016-09-09 15:54:45	na_th_an	like she complains about not having any work but there's been a couple bugs slip through things she has tested that she really could have caught
2016-09-09 15:54:52	keveloper	yeah
2016-09-09 15:55:00	keveloper	there was that DB one a while back
2016-09-09 15:55:02	na_th_an	and she's never raised her hand and been like "That's my fault. I should have caaught that."
2016-09-09 15:55:06	na_th_an	when I definitely have
2016-09-09 15:55:12	na_th_an	like this defect is my fault
2016-09-09 15:55:19	na_th_an	I should have known more about DC and tested it better myself
2016-09-09 15:55:24	na_th_an	and I'll admit that
2016-09-09 15:55:27	na_th_an	but it also should have been tested
2016-09-09 15:56:29	keveloper	ya
2016-09-09 15:56:30	keveloper	idk
2016-09-09 15:56:43	na_th_an	ya idgaf
2016-09-09 15:56:48	keveloper	idk but i just cant listen to her talk
2016-09-09 15:57:10	na_th_an	I feel as a junior dev that was given the whole design and implementation bc zach was too busy and we don't have any tech leads or domain architects that this really wasn't my fault
2016-09-09 15:57:13	na_th_an	even though it is
2016-09-09 15:57:38	na_th_an	my design didn't take into account the DC settings... because I don't know anything about DC
2016-09-09 15:57:48	na_th_an	and zach didn't think of it when I went overy my design
2016-09-09 15:57:57	na_th_an	and nobody else thought of it when doing the code review
2016-09-09 15:57:59	na_th_an	w/e
2016-09-09 15:58:06	keveloper	yeah
2016-09-09 15:58:23	na_th_an	like the first thing that happened with this defect was
2016-09-09 15:58:50	na_th_an	"zach is too busy, we don't have our tech lead any more, and JB is gone. Can you do the design for this critical thing?"
2016-09-09 15:59:02	na_th_an	"by yourself as your first solutioning ever"
2016-09-09 15:59:15	keveloper	"how did this happen?"
2016-09-09 15:59:24	keveloper	"sense of ownership"
2016-09-09 15:59:37	keveloper	wanna vend
2016-09-09 15:59:39	keveloper	balc

2016-09-10 04:04:58	-->	na_th_an (~na_th_an@172.ip-158-69-48.net) is back on server
2016-09-12 08:41:58	keveloper	you got here early
2016-09-12 08:42:11	na_th_an	I was afraid I killed everything
2016-09-12 08:42:12	keveloper	i kinda wanna start working like 7 to 3:30
2016-09-12 08:42:46	na_th_an	ya that'd be kinda nice
2016-09-12 08:42:48	na_th_an	I've thought about it
2016-09-12 08:42:52	keveloper	no rush hour
2016-09-12 08:42:57	na_th_an	but I got here at like 8:20 not v early
2016-09-12 08:43:05	keveloper	oh your car was far up
2016-09-12 08:43:19	na_th_an	the space by the light pole is usually skipped
2016-09-12 08:43:23	na_th_an	I took it today
2016-09-12 08:43:32	keveloper	ah

2016-09-12 08:43:51	keveloper	i wanna like make more money off of my coding ability lol
2016-09-12 08:43:54	keveloper	but idk how
2016-09-12 08:43:58	keveloper	like do i make a catchy game
2016-09-12 08:44:02	keveloper	and put ads on it
2016-09-12 08:44:28	na_th_an	freelancing is probably the safest way to make money with coding
2016-09-12 08:44:29	keveloper	i dont think i could create a freemium game and not kill myself lol
2016-09-12 08:44:36	keveloper	yeah
2016-09-12 08:44:44	keveloper	im probably gonna git up 30 lines again
2016-09-12 08:44:46	na_th_an	making money off an app/game is pretty much like hitting the lottery
2016-09-12 08:44:50	na_th_an	only it takes a TON more work
2016-09-12 08:44:56	na_th_an	than buying a ticket
2016-09-12 08:45:09	keveloper	even just like a little bit of money?
2016-09-12 08:45:21	na_th_an	a little bit probably isn't too hard
2016-09-12 08:45:37	keveloper	im not talking like flappy birds lol
2016-09-12 08:45:54	keveloper	although $70k a day or whatever it was would be p nice

2016-09-12 08:48:49	keveloper	oh i forgot
2016-09-12 08:49:01	keveloper	katie bond told me we are probably going back to sprints
2016-09-12 08:49:27	na_th_an	what does that mean
2016-09-12 08:49:38	na_th_an	sprints and what we're doing now aren't that different
2016-09-12 08:49:41	na_th_an	from my pov

2016-09-12 15:41:41	na_th_an	he's p helpful
2016-09-12 16:00:00	keveloper	IE > Firefox for once
2016-09-12 16:00:02	keveloper	only once
2016-09-12 16:01:46	na_th_an	there's a very short list of things IE does well
2016-09-12 16:02:03	na_th_an	there's some other obscure feature IE supports that other browsers don't/didn't
2016-09-12 16:02:07	na_th_an	i forget what
2016-09-12 16:02:35	keveloper	i cant find much on this
2016-09-12 16:03:37	keveloper	im trying to just find the difference between FF and what everone else does
2016-09-12 16:03:39	keveloper	this is infuriating
2016-09-12 16:05:22	keveloper	like how can i find what EXACTLY causes chrome/ie/safari to not save the page in history
2016-09-12 16:05:38	na_th_an	look in chrome source code
2016-09-12 16:05:42	na_th_an	then look in FF source code
2016-09-12 16:05:45	keveloper	lol what
2016-09-12 16:05:50	na_th_an	(don't look in chrome source code. I hear it's awful)
2016-09-12 16:06:28	na_th_an	https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=788497
2016-09-12 16:07:42	keveloper	"If this is broken, it's probably because the "redirect" page is actually loading and running some JavaScript or something instead of using a "real" redirect."
2016-09-12 16:07:47	keveloper	well chrome and safari do just fine so
2016-09-12 16:08:05	keveloper	> This situation is ridiculous. When a user hits back they want to see the
2016-09-12 16:08:05	keveloper	> previous thing they saw.
2016-09-12 16:08:09	keveloper	these type of people are the worst
2016-09-12 16:10:19	keveloper	but these aren't redirects
2016-09-12 16:10:33	keveloper	these are 200s that JS navigates away from via post
2016-09-12 16:10:51	keveloper	im so curious
2016-09-12 16:12:27	na_th_an	about what
2016-09-12 16:12:45	keveloper	time interval
2016-09-12 16:13:01	keveloper	My initial suspicion is that if you navigate fast enough through some websites the time interval at which chrome saves its history is longer than you actually stay on the site so the history engine does not "record" the website you visited because you moved faster than it's scan frequency
2016-09-12 16:13:19	na_th_an	that's what i'd guess
2016-09-12 16:14:06	keveloper	this is hard to find
2016-09-12 16:15:04	keveloper	uhhh
2016-09-12 16:15:05	keveloper	hmm
2016-09-12 16:15:11	na_th_an	idk man
2016-09-12 16:15:46	keveloper	im j ust trying to find anything about this time interval to save to history
2016-09-12 16:16:08	na_th_an	find the chromium developer slack/irc channel and ask em
2016-09-12 16:16:17	keveloper	ooh good idea
2016-09-12 16:16:19	na_th_an	or mailing list
2016-09-12 16:16:21	na_th_an	you could send an email
2016-09-12 16:16:31	keveloper	im in
2016-09-12 16:17:38	keveloper	idk if i worded that the best but oh well
2016-09-12 16:17:46	keveloper	oops "How chrome not know" lol
2016-09-12 16:18:00	keveloper	"how chrome know not" **
2016-09-12 16:18:53	keveloper	no response
2016-09-12 16:19:04	na_th_an	you'll probably have better luck on a mailing list 
2016-09-12 16:19:11	keveloper	we'll see
2016-09-12 16:19:30	na_th_an	so are we supposed to be doing anything with these estimates
2016-09-12 16:19:30	keveloper	i guess i dont really need to know
2016-09-12 16:19:35	keveloper	i think we are doing the hack
2016-09-12 16:19:48	keveloper	the only other way is to change where the marc record is shown
2016-09-12 16:20:00	na_th_an	or
2016-09-12 16:20:01	keveloper	it knows whether or not navigations are user initiated
2016-09-12 16:20:06	keveloper	said someone
2016-09-12 16:20:09	na_th_an	we could save a few thousand dollars and have a broken back button
2016-09-12 16:22:58	keveloper	lol
2016-09-12 16:23:03	keveloper	open in a new window would fix it
2016-09-13 08:42:02	keveloper	yo
2016-09-13 08:42:09	keveloper	where can i look for an example of this dialog thing
2016-09-13 08:42:52	na_th_an	the marc error
2016-09-13 08:44:14	keveloper	where that
2016-09-13 08:45:02	na_th_an	marc button
2016-09-13 08:45:07	na_th_an	sign in with someone that doesn't have permission
2016-09-13 08:45:10	na_th_an	or place hold
2016-09-13 08:45:19	na_th_an	click place hold when you aren't signed in
2016-09-13 08:46:40	keveloper	did you get binaebi's wireframe email
2016-09-13 08:46:52	na_th_an	ya
2016-09-13 08:47:11	keveloper	i dont see it
2016-09-13 08:47:20	na_th_an	she sent it to you
2016-09-13 08:47:25	na_th_an	yesterday aat 5:17
2016-09-13 08:47:37	keveloper	oh i accidentally deleted it
2016-09-13 08:47:56	na_th_an	yesterday I was reading a thread on r/askreddit about how it's fucked up that we don't discuss salaries
2016-09-13 08:48:00	na_th_an	and it only benefits the employer
2016-09-13 08:48:14	na_th_an	and ppl were talking about how it's illegal to retaliate against employees for discussing their salary
2016-09-13 08:48:28	na_th_an	and some ppl were claiming it's illegal for a manager to even tell ppl that they shouldn't discuss salaries
2016-09-13 08:49:13	keveloper	oh really
2016-09-13 08:49:16	keveloper	in ohio?
2016-09-13 08:49:23	na_th_an	it's national
2016-09-13 08:49:24	keveloper	i feel like thats state by state
2016-09-13 08:49:26	keveloper	sweet
2016-09-13 08:49:32	na_th_an	ohio IS an at-will work state
2016-09-13 08:49:38	keveloper	so i could get fired
2016-09-13 08:49:43	na_th_an	so they can fire you for wearing a blue shirt a month after you discuss your salary
2016-09-13 08:49:48	na_th_an	but you can't get fired for discussing your salary
2016-09-13 08:49:53	na_th_an	obv proving anything is hard

2016-09-13 10:34:32	keveloper	no because that controller is what redirects and opens the dialog
2016-09-13 10:34:39	na_th_an	p
2016-09-13 10:34:41	na_th_an	ya
2016-09-13 10:34:48	keveloper	huh
2016-09-13 10:34:59	keveloper	so how does the dialog get its data
2016-09-13 10:35:26	na_th_an	the ajax controller that returns a view
2016-09-13 10:35:31	na_th_an	that gets stuck into the dialog
2016-09-13 10:36:07	keveloper	so the marc-record-dialog.js needs to make an ajax call on init
2016-09-13 10:36:13	keveloper	to get the marc record
2016-09-13 10:36:17	na_th_an	ya
2016-09-13 10:36:24	keveloper	should it have a spinner
2016-09-13 10:36:28	na_th_an	idk 
2016-09-13 10:36:33	na_th_an	I doubt it'll take very long
2016-09-13 10:36:39	na_th_an	the bib record should be cached already
2016-09-13 10:36:49	na_th_an	I wouldn't do it until it's needed
2016-09-13 10:36:51	keveloper	how do we do ajax lol
2016-09-13 10:36:54	na_th_an	jquery
2016-09-13 10:37:08	keveloper	$.get ?
2016-09-13 10:37:11	keveloper	$.ajax?
2016-09-13 10:38:04	na_th_an	idk
2016-09-13 10:38:11	na_th_an	use jquery
2016-09-13 10:38:18	keveloper	im looking for anything that uses ajax requests in the front end
2016-09-13 10:39:17	keveloper	it doesnt look like we do $.ajax shit anyhwere
2016-09-13 10:39:33	keveloper	oh jk found it
2016-09-13 10:39:34	keveloper	k
2016-09-13 10:42:19	keveloper	shit so
2016-09-13 10:42:25	keveloper	uh
2016-09-13 10:42:33	keveloper	okay this needs to happen differently
2016-09-13 10:42:47	keveloper	the marc thing is built in a jsp right now
2016-09-13 10:42:49	keveloper	that cant happen
2016-09-13 10:43:10	keveloper	unless I make a different controller explicitly for the dialog
2016-09-13 10:43:18	keveloper	/ajax/marc/oclc/{no} or something
2016-09-13 10:43:26	na_th_an	you should
2016-09-13 10:43:28	na_th_an	imo
2016-09-13 10:43:29	keveloper	I can't change /marc/oclc/{no} order of zach
2016-09-13 10:43:38	keveloper	the SearchControllerOne
2016-09-13 10:43:46	keveloper	oops lol i stuck in CamelCase there
2016-09-13 10:43:59	na_th_an	thisIsCamel
2016-09-13 10:44:02	na_th_an	ThisIs... I forgot
2016-09-13 10:44:04	keveloper	camel is both
2016-09-13 10:44:07	na_th_an	no
2016-09-13 10:44:08	keveloper	PascalCase
2016-09-13 10:44:09	na_th_an	camels have humps
2016-09-13 10:44:13	na_th_an	they don't start with a hump
2016-09-13 10:44:19	keveloper	I like to call it title case
2016-09-13 10:44:21	keveloper	Pascal though
2016-09-13 10:44:24	na_th_an	title case is good
2016-09-13 10:44:34	keveloper	ClassCase
2016-09-13 10:44:35	keveloper	idk
2016-09-13 10:44:45	na_th_an	JavaCase
2016-09-13 10:44:47	keveloper	so this will basically be a copy/paste of fetch lol
2016-09-13 10:45:22	keveloper	except this is the part where we can make it simpler
2016-09-13 10:46:34	keveloper	so i have MarcRecordAccessController and MarcRecordController...
2016-09-13 10:46:48	keveloper	or should I just make another end point in the SearchController
2016-09-13 10:46:49	keveloper	no
2016-09-13 10:46:51	keveloper	no im not doing that
2016-09-13 10:46:53	keveloper	fuck that class

2016-09-13 10:47:19	na_th_an	deal with those abc metrics?
2016-09-13 10:47:20	keveloper	nope

2016-09-14 13:52:44	na_th_an	and he replied "damnit she was probably on her phone"

2016-09-14 14:57:24	na_th_an	if the referer is empty
2016-09-14 14:57:43	na_th_an	or if the referer is like, google.com
2016-09-14 15:03:51	na_th_an	this is the 2nd week that we were to have "all hands on deck" fixing tests
2016-09-14 15:03:56	na_th_an	and "all hands on deck" == nathan

2016-09-14 15:13:51	na_th_an	lololololololol
2016-09-14 15:14:23	keveloper	did i address all the shit
2016-09-14 15:15:00	na_th_an	"Does it matter if the user came via non-DiscoveryUI website?
2016-09-14 15:15:35	keveloper	Is my answer fine
2016-09-14 15:15:36	keveloper	just posted
2016-09-14 15:16:19	na_th_an	how does the user get to the /marcAccess/832480 endpoint?
2016-09-14 15:16:55	keveloper	window.href= i think
2016-09-14 15:17:04	na_th_an	like
2016-09-14 15:17:06	na_th_an	what action do they take
2016-09-14 15:17:10	keveloper	clicking a button
2016-09-14 15:17:12	na_th_an	so they click on a link and then JS does that?
2016-09-14 15:17:18	keveloper	its not js its a just a link
2016-09-14 15:17:23	na_th_an	ya so
2016-09-14 15:17:29	na_th_an	they could right click and hit "bookmark"
2016-09-14 15:17:35	na_th_an	or drag that link into their bookmark toolbar
2016-09-14 15:17:38	na_th_an	couldn't they?
2016-09-14 15:17:46	keveloper	they could yeah
2016-09-14 15:17:58	na_th_an	then be at google.com and press the link
2016-09-14 15:17:58	keveloper	but they wont lol
2016-09-14 15:18:46	keveloper	but the marcAccess endpoint sends you to either IDM, or back to where you were with #marcRecord/blah
2016-09-14 15:18:55	keveloper	or #marcError
2016-09-14 15:19:01	keveloper	if @PreAuth fails
2016-09-14 15:19:08	keveloper	/marcAccess/34234 is never in the URL bar
2016-09-14 15:19:16	na_th_an	I understand what you're saying 
2016-09-14 15:19:20	keveloper	Yeah
2016-09-14 15:19:28	na_th_an	but there's a somewhat valid path that the user could take that would break
2016-09-14 15:19:30	na_th_an	but
2016-09-14 15:19:33	na_th_an	it's already broken rn
2016-09-14 15:19:43	keveloper	librarian staff won't be right clicking and adding to bookmark
2016-09-14 15:19:50	keveloper	I mean we could just be like referer.contains
2016-09-14 15:19:51	keveloper	idk
2016-09-14 15:19:52	na_th_an	I personally don't give a fuck
2016-09-14 15:19:55	keveloper	discovery lol
2016-09-14 15:19:55	keveloper	idk
2016-09-14 15:20:00	na_th_an	idk too
2016-09-14 15:20:02	keveloper	no that wouldnt work
2016-09-14 15:20:05	keveloper	idfk
2016-09-14 15:20:28	na_th_an	I think the way you would fix it
2016-09-14 15:20:41	na_th_an	is to check to see if the referer is not discovery (idk how this would work)
2016-09-14 15:20:49	keveloper	Yeah that was my idea
2016-09-14 15:20:51	na_th_an	and if it isn't, then send them to the detail record page
2016-09-14 15:20:57	keveloper	Yeah I like that

2016-09-14 15:27:25	na_th_an	but apparently psyonix has dropped the banhammer
2016-09-14 15:27:31	na_th_an	on abusive players and trolls

2016-09-15 08:49:57	keveloper	\o/
2016-09-15 08:50:16	na_th_an	so I was driving in right
2016-09-15 08:50:21	keveloper	lets pay close attention to when abby gets here
2016-09-15 08:50:23	keveloper	and when she leaves
2016-09-15 08:50:27	na_th_an	oh I always do
2016-09-15 08:50:33	na_th_an	I check in irc the timestamps
2016-09-15 08:50:49	keveloper	she's been in for like 2 days now
2016-09-15 08:50:58	na_th_an	ya she hasn't taken off any time this week
2016-09-15 08:51:05	keveloper	yayy the marc error security thing works
2016-09-15 08:51:08	na_th_an	she's worked like 7 hours a day
2016-09-15 08:51:12	na_th_an	but I noticed that matt does too
2016-09-15 08:51:21	na_th_an	so I guess qa just doesn't give af
2016-09-15 08:51:22	keveloper	really
2016-09-15 08:51:29	keveloper	so like i think qa is sort of a joke
2016-09-15 08:51:37	na_th_an	ya matt comes at 9 and leaves at like 4:30-5
2016-09-15 08:51:38	keveloper	and like in the most objective way possible
2016-09-15 08:51:40	na_th_an	and takes a lunch
2016-09-15 08:51:42	na_th_an	yeah
2016-09-15 08:51:44	na_th_an	I agree
2016-09-15 08:51:52	keveloper	they should not make as much as us
2016-09-15 08:52:01	keveloper	that was the last half off most objective way possible
2016-09-15 08:52:07	keveloper	like i dont really care
2016-09-15 08:52:26	keveloper	but, if i had abby's  job, making $6... wait she makes more than us
2016-09-15 08:52:29	na_th_an	OMG A GOOD LIVE INTERGRATION BUILD
2016-09-15 08:52:32	na_th_an	barely

2016-09-15 08:52:42	na_th_an	I don't really give a fuck
2016-09-15 08:52:49	keveloper	61,800 is what she makes
2016-09-15 08:53:08	na_th_an	gotta make more when you have to hire movers for $800
2016-09-15 08:53:17	keveloper	lol
2016-09-15 08:53:24	keveloper	then didnt believe that me and you could move her shit in
2016-09-15 08:53:32	na_th_an	that's uhh
2016-09-15 08:53:36	keveloper	its fucking picking things up and dropping them lol
2016-09-15 08:53:38	na_th_an	there' a word for that in psychology
2016-09-15 08:53:47	keveloper	authoritative fallacy
2016-09-15 08:53:50	na_th_an	like if I support trump
2016-09-15 08:53:55	na_th_an	and he looks good at first
2016-09-15 08:54:01	na_th_an	then he does a bunch of racist and shitty things
2016-09-15 08:54:09	na_th_an	I might not agree with that
2016-09-15 08:54:10	keveloper	oh thats not what i thought you meant
2016-09-15 08:54:12	na_th_an	but I don't wanna look dumb
2016-09-15 08:54:18	na_th_an	so I double down and am like
2016-09-15 08:54:21	na_th_an	"He doesn't really believe that"
2016-09-15 08:54:25	na_th_an	cognitive dissonance
2016-09-15 08:54:27	na_th_an	is part of it
2016-09-15 08:54:40	na_th_an	bc I don't wanna look foolish, not just to others but to myself
2016-09-15 08:54:43	keveloper	what abby thing are you applying to this
2016-09-15 08:54:47	na_th_an	movers
2016-09-15 08:54:53	keveloper	what like she had the idea
2016-09-15 08:54:54	na_th_an	also she paid a deposit already
2016-09-15 08:55:03	keveloper	oh
2016-09-15 08:55:10	na_th_an	ya she was arguing why it was a good idea and had already put in the effort to schedule them and shit
2016-09-15 08:55:11	keveloper	then we were all like "why are you doing that"
2016-09-15 08:55:20	na_th_an	and there was no way she could go back bc the deposit
2016-09-15 08:55:33	na_th_an	so she had to double down and be like "no you can't do that"
2016-09-15 08:55:38	na_th_an	"I need insurance"
2016-09-15 08:55:38	keveloper	i think its more of her not understanding physical labor
2016-09-15 08:55:43	na_th_an	that too
2016-09-15 08:55:47	na_th_an	both imo
2016-09-15 08:55:52	keveloper	like i moved people in and out of shit a lot
2016-09-15 08:55:56	keveloper	its not hard
2016-09-15 08:56:03	keveloper	where is she btw
2016-09-15 08:56:06	na_th_an	she doesn't even have a lot of shit

2016-09-15 08:56:14	keveloper	but yeah about her working like 7 hour days
2016-09-15 08:56:15	na_th_an	qa really is a joke tho
2016-09-15 08:56:26	na_th_an	like, qa ppl should know a little about code

2016-09-15 08:56:31	na_th_an	like abby does nothing
2016-09-15 08:56:37	na_th_an	she could be like "I could help fix tests"
2016-09-15 08:56:39	na_th_an	but she doesn't
2016-09-15 08:56:41	na_th_an	she could

2016-09-15 10:10:42	keveloper	abby seems annoyed about me reminding her of shit but maybe im not tryina get another sri incident lol
2016-09-15 10:11:40	na_th_an	well after she literally did not test the thing I explicitly asked her to test
2016-09-15 10:11:45	na_th_an	I didn't bring it up in the retrospective
2016-09-15 10:11:55	na_th_an	but I brought up to abby that this needed to work with the service config default
2016-09-15 10:12:01	na_th_an	and she just didn't test it
2016-09-15 10:12:15	na_th_an	I asked her for an institution that had relevance as a default search so I could make sure that still worked
2016-09-15 10:12:20	na_th_an	and I told abby to check that
2016-09-15 10:12:25	na_th_an	and she said she did
2016-09-15 10:12:30	na_th_an	but apparently she didn't

2016-09-15 10:28:40	keveloper	how wrong would it be to work on cluttr
2016-09-15 10:29:00	na_th_an	eh
2016-09-15 10:29:07	keveloper	lol
2016-09-15 10:29:07	na_th_an	wrong but
2016-09-15 10:29:13	na_th_an	I'm doing gulp shit while my tests run
2016-09-15 10:29:15	na_th_an	to stay sane
2016-09-15 10:29:17	na_th_an	and "learn"
2016-09-15 10:29:23	na_th_an	4 real tho
2016-09-15 10:29:27	keveloper	yeah i wanna setup gulp to compile scss and convert my css to scss
2016-09-15 10:29:37	na_th_an	as long as you don't make a profit off it then it's no worse than reading reddit
2016-09-15 10:29:43	na_th_an	and in fact better because it's "training"
2016-09-15 10:29:45	keveloper	yeah
2016-09-15 10:30:08	na_th_an	if you later go to make a profit off it and you used oclc resources then that's super bad
2016-09-15 10:30:10	na_th_an	like richard
2016-09-15 10:30:52	keveloper	so youre saying that since I am rewriting cluttr on a work laptop, if i ever make a profit from it I can get sued
2016-09-15 10:31:00	na_th_an	yes
2016-09-15 10:31:15	keveloper	#usLegalSystem
2016-09-15 10:31:19	na_th_an	the likelihood of that happening and being provable is pretty low
2016-09-15 10:31:24	keveloper	yeah
2016-09-15 10:31:28	na_th_an	well that's part of your employement agreement with OCLC
2016-09-15 10:31:37	keveloper	considering I also have a macbook lol
2016-09-15 10:31:53	keveloper	i want to take it off of this laptop anyway so i can write when i forget this guy
2016-09-15 10:32:04	keveloper	because im not doing a ton of commits yet
2016-09-15 10:32:08	keveloper	just kinda like throwing shit together
2016-09-15 10:32:12	na_th_an	that made no sense at all
2016-09-15 10:32:29	keveloper	what
2016-09-15 10:32:38	keveloper	lolol
2016-09-15 10:32:39	na_th_an	 because im not doing a ton of commits yet
2016-09-15 10:32:42	na_th_an	whoops not that
2016-09-15 10:32:46	na_th_an	 i want to take it off of this laptop anyway so i can write when i forget this guy
2016-09-15 10:32:48	keveloper	lol
2016-09-15 10:32:52	na_th_an	what does that even mean
2016-09-15 10:32:55	keveloper	if i leave this laptop at work
2016-09-15 10:32:59	na_th_an	oh
2016-09-15 10:33:01	keveloper	i want to still be able to code
2016-09-15 10:33:08	na_th_an	I didn't know what "guy" was there
2016-09-15 10:33:09	keveloper	because im not keeping my git up to date very well
2016-09-15 10:33:14	keveloper	this guy is this laptop
2016-09-15 10:34:29	keveloper	so do you send scss to the front end and gulp converts it or
2016-09-15 10:34:50	keveloper	or is gulp on the server and sends compile css
2016-09-15 10:35:07	na_th_an	uhhhh
2016-09-15 10:35:42	na_th_an	sass is not converted to css on the client
2016-09-15 10:35:47	na_th_an	that would be wasteful
2016-09-15 10:35:52	na_th_an	gulp does not run in the browser
2016-09-15 10:35:59	keveloper	gulp is server side okay
2016-09-15 10:35:59	na_th_an	gulp is to javascript as gradle is java
2016-09-15 10:36:06	keveloper	okay
2016-09-15 10:36:25	keveloper	you using this? https://github.com/dlmanning/gulp-sass
2016-09-15 10:36:33	na_th_an	ya think so
2016-09-15 10:36:40	na_th_an	I played around with gulp a bit before
2016-09-15 10:36:45	na_th_an	but haven't done a lot with it
2016-09-15 10:37:10	na_th_an	it's pretty new but I think it's gonna replace grunt eventually
2016-09-15 10:37:23	na_th_an	mvn is grunt, gradle is gulp
2016-09-15 10:37:28	keveloper	is it bad to have a production instance of something just doing mvn spring-boot:run
2016-09-15 10:37:38	keveloper	like instead of packaging and deploying that jar or whatever
2016-09-15 10:38:02	na_th_an	if development mode is disabled then I don't think it's *bad*
2016-09-15 10:38:08	na_th_an	idk what the proper thing to do
2016-09-15 10:38:20	na_th_an	idk if it's good
2016-09-15 10:38:37	keveloper	like i dont want to have a tomcat instance
2016-09-15 10:38:42	keveloper	can jetty not be embedded
2016-09-15 10:38:49	na_th_an	yes?
2016-09-15 10:38:51	keveloper	i dont want to have a server instance that i deploy war's to
2016-09-15 10:39:22	na_th_an	If you use the Maven build (mvn clean install) provided by the Spring Boot Initialzr, you’ll get a fat jar. This jar is handy because it includes all the other dependencies and things like your web server inside the archive. You can give anybody this one .jar and they can run your entire Spring application with no fuss: no build tool required, no setup, no web server configuration, etc: just java -jar
2016-09-15 10:39:24	na_th_an	...your.jar.
2016-09-15 10:39:43	keveloper	omg thats incredible
2016-09-15 10:40:01	keveloper	:')
2016-09-15 10:40:05	keveloper	that makes me so happy
2016-09-15 10:40:07	na_th_an	<3 spring boot
2016-09-15 10:40:19	keveloper	I wonder if b clark knows
2016-09-15 10:40:27	na_th_an	lol
2016-09-15 10:40:34	keveloper	he was pretty amped on spring boot
2016-09-15 10:40:52	keveloper	play has literally nothing on spring
2016-09-15 10:41:01	keveloper	like I would NEVER pick play over spring
2016-09-15 10:41:09	keveloper	it was shit compared to spring
2016-09-15 10:41:17	keveloper	and you have to get their stupid activator tool
2016-09-15 10:41:21	keveloper	and SBT
2016-09-15 10:41:26	keveloper	(scala build tool)
2016-09-15 10:41:41	keveloper	all you need it git and mvn to deploy shit
2016-09-15 10:41:45	keveloper	thats incredible
2016-09-15 10:41:48	keveloper	(and java obv)
2016-09-15 10:42:16	keveloper	git clone http://blah.com/blah.git; mvn clean install; java -jar name.jar;
2016-09-15 10:42:26	keveloper	install script for a spring boot ap
2016-09-15 10:42:36	keveloper	I forgot a cd oops
2016-09-15 10:43:27	keveloper	I might have to use quickbuild lol
2016-09-15 10:43:31	keveloper	or jenkins
2016-09-15 10:43:36	keveloper	To install my shit
2016-09-15 10:43:39	keveloper	This is exciting
2016-09-15 10:44:02	na_th_an	what shit
2016-09-15 10:44:18	keveloper	Well I could do that for pernt right now if I ever update it (lol right)
2016-09-15 10:44:20	keveloper	but for cluttr
2016-09-15 10:44:22	keveloper	when I finish
2016-09-15 10:44:27	keveloper	or get a working product
2016-09-15 10:44:30	keveloper	that im developing on
2016-09-15 10:45:06	keveloper	pernt right now is just a manual mvn spring-boot:run command on asteria (this server im talking to you on) lol
2016-09-15 10:47:18	na_th_an	urlviewer is a 
2016-09-15 10:47:22	na_th_an	git clone
2016-09-15 10:47:24	na_th_an	rm -rf
2016-09-15 10:47:26	na_th_an	cp -r
2016-09-15 10:47:39	keveloper	is it a script
2016-09-15 10:47:43	na_th_an	it just copies the contents of the "app" folder into a webserver
2016-09-15 10:47:46	na_th_an	it's on my jenkins instance
2016-09-15 10:48:06	keveloper	ohh ya its all front end

2016-09-15 10:48:44	keveloper	its a shebang
2016-09-15 10:49:12	na_th_an	you could argue that it's /slightly/ more correct todo #! /usr/bin/env bash
2016-09-15 10:49:49	keveloper	if you cd in a bash script will the person who executed it end up there
2016-09-15 10:50:03	na_th_an	maybe
2016-09-15 10:50:17	keveloper	where does boot put that jar

2016-09-16 13:19:59	na_th_an	if they won't give you an IDP take one
2016-09-16 13:20:02	keveloper	lolol
2016-09-16 13:24:47	keveloper	yo
2016-09-16 13:25:00	keveloper	you know of a way to like not use H2 but have everything wrapped with your jar
2016-09-16 13:25:17	na_th_an	what do you mean
2016-09-16 13:25:48	na_th_an	are you asking if there's other embedded sql servers for java?
2016-09-16 13:25:51	keveloper	Like postgres packaged with your jar or something idk, so to deploy you can still just do git clone, cd, mvn run
2016-09-16 13:25:57	keveloper	Yeah but persistence
2016-09-16 13:26:04	na_th_an	you can do persistence with h2
2016-09-16 13:26:11	keveloper	Isn't H2 super not scalable
2016-09-16 13:26:26	keveloper	http://www.h2-performance.com/
2016-09-16 13:26:30	keveloper	lol not what i was looking for
2016-09-16 13:26:45	na_th_an	if you're running your data backend and your http server on the same computer from the same jar you're probably not worried about scalability
2016-09-16 13:26:59	na_th_an	no embedded sql server is going to be scalable I think
2016-09-16 13:27:09	keveloper	yeah i guess so :/ lol
2016-09-16 13:27:21	keveloper	i just hate setting up sql servers on remote servers
2016-09-16 13:27:25	keveloper	and setting on dbms shit
2016-09-16 13:28:08	na_th_an	so use H2 embedded?
2016-09-16 13:28:13	na_th_an	why don't you wanna use H2
2016-09-16 13:28:14	keveloper	ugh
2016-09-16 13:28:23	na_th_an	also it's not hard to set up a mariadb server
2016-09-16 13:28:26	keveloper	i don't know how to make a complicated database with JPA
2016-09-16 13:28:28	na_th_an	or a postgres server
2016-09-16 13:28:36	na_th_an	H2 has a web interface
2016-09-16 13:28:39	keveloper	really
2016-09-16 13:28:42	na_th_an	I think so
2016-09-16 13:29:04	keveloper	or i could just learn JPA better lol
2016-09-16 13:29:13	na_th_an	JPA won't be the only thing you need
2016-09-16 13:29:19	keveloper	what do you mean
2016-09-16 13:29:27	na_th_an	you'll probably want or need SQL at some point
2016-09-16 13:30:26	keveloper	ugh yeah probably
2016-09-16 13:31:22	keveloper	I'm trying to avoid this shit lol
2016-09-16 13:31:22	keveloper	https://github.com/kholland950/cluttr-old/blob/master/src/main/java/edu/capital/csdb/models/dataUtil/FriendsHelper.java
2016-09-16 13:31:50	keveloper	Like line 100 lol
2016-09-16 13:32:22	na_th_an	someone somewhere has to do the logic on your database
2016-09-16 13:32:27	na_th_an	the relations and everything
2016-09-16 13:32:33	na_th_an	and from what I've read SQL is the best way to do it
2016-09-16 13:32:36	na_th_an	JPA is good
2016-09-16 13:32:43	na_th_an	but once you get past a certain point
2016-09-16 13:32:47	na_th_an	it gets harder to use JPA 
2016-09-16 13:32:56	keveloper	JPA was really good for pernt because it was one table
2016-09-16 13:32:59	na_th_an	yeah
2016-09-16 13:33:00	keveloper	Maybe I should just use postgres
2016-09-16 13:33:17	na_th_an	if you want a persistent db that will undergo migrations I'd use postgres or mariadb
2016-09-16 13:33:31	keveloper	Idk what maria is
2016-09-16 13:33:36	na_th_an	if you just want a temporary backend that won't do migrations I'd do H2
2016-09-16 13:33:41	na_th_an	mariadb is open source mysql
2016-09-16 13:33:44	na_th_an	mysql without oracle
2016-09-16 13:33:48	keveloper	Oh sway
2016-09-16 13:33:54	keveloper	No I need to do migratinos
2016-09-16 13:33:57	na_th_an	iif you do pacman -
2016-09-16 13:34:03	na_th_an	pacman -S mysql you get mariadb
2016-09-16 13:34:11	keveloper	i think i'd prefer postgres
2016-09-16 13:34:13	keveloper	idk why but i do
2016-09-16 13:34:17	na_th_an	postgres is better
2016-09-16 13:34:23	na_th_an	objectively
2016-09-16 13:34:24	keveloper	jeff jacob's commenting on my shit woo
2016-09-16 13:34:39	na_th_an	:( he never commented on my shit
2016-09-16 13:34:47	na_th_an	postgres has a couple sore points but nothing you'll run into
2016-09-16 13:34:52	keveloper	"development teams" aka kevin zach and nathan
2016-09-16 13:34:53	na_th_an	everything you'll use is better than it is in mariadb
2016-09-16 13:34:57	na_th_an	lolololo
2016-09-16 13:34:59	na_th_an	ying helped
2016-09-16 13:35:07	keveloper	when
2016-09-16 13:35:11	keveloper	this is all for MARC shit
2016-09-16 13:35:16	na_th_an	*shrug*
2016-09-16 13:35:18	na_th_an	idk
2016-09-16 13:35:26	na_th_an	she did good work on the search relevance part 2 shit
2016-09-16 13:35:38	keveloper	yeah true but this is marc stuff
2016-09-16 13:37:35	keveloper	why is Maria better
2016-09-16 13:37:38	keveloper	like whats different
2016-09-16 13:37:48	na_th_an	better than what
2016-09-16 13:38:32	keveloper	MySQL
2016-09-16 13:38:55	keveloper	I just want a simple and non-hassle way to get a postgres server and db onto a server
2016-09-16 13:39:19	na_th_an	mysql is closed source and backed by oracle
2016-09-16 13:39:21	keveloper	server is easy, db is pretty easy, just export and import i guess, but like the user data
2016-09-16 13:39:24	na_th_an	mariadb is open source and not backed by the devil
2016-09-16 13:39:30	keveloper	lol
2016-09-16 13:39:31	keveloper	+1
2016-09-16 13:39:58	na_th_an	sudo pacman -S postgresql
2016-09-16 13:40:03	na_th_an	sudo systemctl enable postgresql
2016-09-16 13:40:08	keveloper	wtf
2016-09-16 13:40:09	keveloper	pg_dump -C -h localhost -U localuser dbname | psql -h remotehost -U remoteuser dbname
2016-09-16 13:40:09	na_th_an	sudo systemctl start postgresql
2016-09-16 13:40:10	keveloper	you can do that
2016-09-16 13:40:24	na_th_an	I'm not surprised
2016-09-16 13:40:33	keveloper	the shit I hate is setting up user and stuff
2016-09-16 13:40:57	na_th_an	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PostgreSQL#Create_your_first_database.2Fuser
2016-09-16 13:40:57	keveloper	also idk anything about like security standards as far as databases and passwords in code and stuff
2016-09-16 13:40:59	na_th_an	looks pretty easy
2016-09-16 13:41:10	na_th_an	don't commit them
2016-09-16 13:41:12	na_th_an	provide template files
2016-09-16 13:41:21	na_th_an	and put the things you shouldn't commit in your .gitignore
2016-09-16 13:41:32	keveloper	Well I want to be able to clone then deploy
2016-09-16 13:41:42	keveloper	not clone then go fill out passwords then deploy lol
2016-09-16 13:41:49	na_th_an	so make it so you can provide the user/pass on the CLI
2016-09-16 13:41:55	keveloper	ooh hm
2016-09-16 13:41:57	na_th_an	java -jar jar.jar -Duser=user -Dpass=pass
2016-09-16 13:42:09	na_th_an	there's literally no other way to do it
2016-09-16 13:42:11	keveloper	or my postgres server can only accept localhost connection
2016-09-16 13:42:12	keveloper	s
2016-09-16 13:42:19	na_th_an	yeah you can do that
2016-09-16 13:42:22	keveloper	i might do that
2016-09-16 13:42:33	keveloper	i see how oclc got their install script shit everywhere lol
2016-09-16 13:42:41	na_th_an	makes remote testing harder
2016-09-16 13:42:49	na_th_an	like running on your laptop with a remote db
2016-09-16 13:43:02	keveloper	True
2016-09-16 13:44:05	keveloper	I'm just spoiled by H2 now
2016-09-16 13:44:11	keveloper	cluttr is postgres right now
2016-09-16 13:44:22	keveloper	https://github.com/kholland950/cluttr-old/blob/master/src/main/resources/db.properties
2016-09-16 13:44:23	keveloper	lol

2016-09-20 13:15:32	keveloper	btw if you see anything that uses MySQL
2016-09-20 13:15:43	keveloper	you probably need to get the databases migrated

2016-09-20 13:31:42	keveloper	i wonder why bill gave it to us
2016-09-20 13:31:47	keveloper	its either because he thinks we are good
2016-09-20 13:31:53	keveloper	and it needs to make a deadline
2016-09-20 13:32:05	keveloper	or because he wants the "better" developers doing actually changes
2016-09-20 13:32:09	keveloper	but I think its the first one
2016-09-20 13:32:13	keveloper	also

2016-09-23 15:57:17	keveloper	the scss import thing
2016-09-23 15:57:29	keveloper	unless i do like body class=messages-bg or something
2016-09-23 15:57:34	na_th_an	put the background image on a div with a class
2016-09-23 15:57:42	keveloper	hmmmmmm
2016-09-23 15:57:58	keveloper	putting all of your css in one common.css just doesnt seem like a good idea
2016-09-23 15:58:07	na_th_an	*shrug*
2016-09-23 15:58:09	na_th_an	idk
2016-09-23 15:58:17	na_th_an	in some ways it encourages better css
2016-09-23 15:58:26	keveloper	i guess idk
2016-09-23 16:01:38	keveloper	ya its all fucked up lol
2016-09-23 16:01:42	keveloper	hmmm
2016-09-23 16:01:57	keveloper	like why would i want to make my css more complicated
2016-09-23 16:01:58	keveloper	idk
2016-09-23 16:02:04	keveloper	i dont get why common.css is a good idea
2016-09-23 16:02:15	keveloper	i like the idea a lot
2016-09-23 16:02:19	keveloper	give me advantages
2016-09-23 16:02:32	na_th_an	give other solutions and I'll tell you the advantages
2016-09-23 16:02:37	na_th_an	or disadvantages
2016-09-23 16:02:49	keveloper	separate css files for every page
2016-09-23 16:02:54	keveloper	include that in the page
2016-09-23 16:03:58	na_th_an	oh
2016-09-23 16:04:00	na_th_an	definitely do that
2016-09-23 16:04:25	keveloper	..
2016-09-23 16:04:26	keveloper	wait what
2016-09-23 16:04:58	na_th_an	separate CSS file for each page
2016-09-23 16:05:07	na_th_an	and use scss to include those CSS files into a common.css
2016-09-23 16:05:19	na_th_an	I guess I don't fully understand what you're doing
2016-09-23 16:41:12	keveloper	so
2016-09-23 16:41:14	keveloper	<head th:include="fragments/head"></head>
2016-09-23 16:41:14	keveloper	<head>
2016-09-23 16:41:14	keveloper	    <link href="style/home.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen,projection"/>
2016-09-23 16:41:14	keveloper	</head>
2016-09-23 16:41:23	keveloper	i tried that in the link ended up in the body
2016-09-23 16:41:32	keveloper	the include overwrites anything in <head>
2016-09-23 16:41:37	keveloper	and there's no way around that functionality
2016-09-23 16:42:09	na_th_an	can you do a <head> without the th:include
2016-09-23 16:42:14	na_th_an	and just do a <th:include> tag 
2016-09-23 16:42:32	na_th_an	<head><th:include="blah"><link rel="other shit"/></head>
2016-09-23 16:42:38	keveloper	yeah i was thinking that
2016-09-23 16:42:43	keveloper	can you do a div in the head
2016-09-23 16:42:53	na_th_an	you probably can and it'd work but that's dumb
2016-09-23 16:42:57	keveloper	but not hats not how thymleaf works
2016-09-23 16:43:04	na_th_an	th should be able to replace without having to put it in a tag I'd think
2016-09-23 16:43:05	keveloper	no thats not how*
2016-09-23 16:43:16	keveloper	thymeleaf statements arent tags
2016-09-23 16:43:20	keveloper	they are attributes
2016-09-23 16:43:28	na_th_an	Use th:remove="tag". (documentation) 
2016-09-23 16:43:40	na_th_an	put it on a <div> or a <span>
2016-09-23 16:43:42	na_th_an	use that attr
2016-09-23 16:43:49	na_th_an	and thymeleaf will remove that tag
2016-09-23 16:43:52	keveloper	what
2016-09-23 16:43:57	keveloper	i dont get what youre saying
2016-09-23 16:44:34	keveloper	div isn't allowed in head
2016-09-23 16:45:03	keveloper	i wanna include without a container
2016-09-23 16:45:08	keveloper	i have an idea
2016-09-23 16:45:31	keveloper	you can do like arguments
2016-09-23 16:45:32	na_th_an	rashmi gets here at 9:30 and she's leaving rn
2016-09-23 16:45:36	na_th_an	I guess that means I can go too
2016-09-23 16:45:39	na_th_an	since I got here at 8:30
2016-09-23 16:46:01	keveloper	fragments/alert :: alert (type='danger', message=${errorMessage})
2016-09-23 16:46:08	keveloper	wait what
2016-09-23 16:46:16	keveloper	anyway i can do
2016-09-23 16:46:18	na_th_an	I'm going to BR

2016-09-27 09:43:22	na_th_an	that's as far as I got after I finished the gulp template
2016-09-27 09:43:37	na_th_an	now I need to make a backend and have some auth
2016-09-27 09:43:41	na_th_an	do you have any auth yet on your shit
2016-09-27 09:43:53	na_th_an	I'm afraid of fucking up auth
2016-09-27 09:44:11	keveloper	can you do like remote connection to a file
2016-09-27 09:44:13	keveloper	you know
2016-09-27 09:44:19	na_th_an	be more specific
2016-09-27 09:44:21	keveloper	like instead of doing something then wgetting it
2016-09-27 09:44:23	na_th_an	what are you trying to do
2016-09-27 09:44:27	keveloper	so i'll do something on the host
2016-09-27 09:44:29	keveloper	wget the log file
2016-09-27 09:44:30	keveloper	and less it
2016-09-27 09:44:32	keveloper	and i like
2016-09-27 09:44:39	keveloper	do some magic to connect to the file lol
2016-09-27 09:44:51	na_th_an	if you can view the file with your user it's easy to do in emacs
2016-09-27 09:45:04	na_th_an	you can do "emacs ssh://user@host:file" to edit a file
2016-09-27 09:45:11	na_th_an	and probably with other shit too
2016-09-27 09:45:14	na_th_an	you could also use sshfs
2016-09-27 09:45:19	na_th_an	to mount the directory over ssh
2016-09-27 09:45:33	keveloper	okay im on the host
2016-09-27 09:45:39	keveloper	how can i less and watch for incoming input
2016-09-27 09:45:55	na_th_an	watch tail -n <lines> 
2016-09-27 09:46:00	na_th_an	watch tail -n <lines> <file>
2016-09-27 09:46:40	keveloper	ohhhh no way
2016-09-27 09:46:42	keveloper	swayyyyyy
2016-09-27 09:46:44	keveloper	swayyy af

2016-09-27 09:49:12	na_th_an	rn
2016-09-27 09:49:28	na_th_an	I should have bought $700 of beef jerky instead of a 1080
2016-09-27 09:49:46	keveloper	lolol
2016-09-27 09:53:18	keveloper	im wathcing a video of someone messing with arma 3 graphics
2016-09-27 09:53:22	keveloper	and the guys like german or something
2016-09-27 09:53:47	keveloper	and he just said "okay anti...al..sing... it makes no sense, i'll do it on 2x"
2016-09-27 10:10:29	na_th_an	I wish I could IDP for the same amount of time that Mark is asleep
2016-09-27 10:11:31	keveloper	that DR issue should be resolved soon
2016-09-27 10:12:12	keveloper	so lindsey texted me a couple days ago
2016-09-27 10:12:17	keveloper	from some random number
2016-09-27 10:12:25	keveloper	telling me that she was raped
2016-09-27 10:12:42	keveloper	and i was like "I'm assuming this is Lindsey... Don't tell me, tell your parents and the cops"
2016-09-27 10:12:47	keveloper	and then blacklisted that number
2016-09-27 10:13:31	keveloper	oh
2016-09-27 10:13:41	keveloper	there's an SF branch on DC btw
2016-09-27 10:13:49	keveloper	its like feature/snowflake or something
2016-09-27 10:13:58	keveloper	origin might be on top of that for some reason idk
2016-09-27 10:14:00	na_th_an	jesus  christ that's fucked up
2016-09-27 10:14:04	keveloper	ya idk
2016-09-27 10:14:20	keveloper	i went back this morning and read what else she said after i blacklisted
2016-09-27 10:14:27	keveloper	and it was liek "well idk if its techincally rape" kinda thing
2016-09-27 10:14:50	keveloper	and the guy said "ha sorry for kinda raping you" according to her
2016-09-27 10:14:54	keveloper	im assuming it was some drunk thing idk

2016-09-27 10:25:14	na_th_an	"our most senior developer was asleep for at least an hour every day"

2016-09-27 12:34:20	na_th_an	hey 
2016-09-27 12:34:24	na_th_an	you never answered my auth question
2016-09-27 12:34:34	na_th_an	at 09:43
2016-09-27 12:34:42	keveloper	uh
2016-09-27 12:35:09	keveloper	no i dont
2016-09-27 12:35:15	keveloper	idk how to properly do auth
2016-09-27 12:35:33	na_th_an	is it just like, type username and you are that user rn?
2016-09-27 12:35:49	keveloper	for cluttr?
2016-09-27 12:35:55	keveloper	no its all wireframes
2016-09-27 12:35:55	na_th_an	ya
2016-09-27 12:35:57	na_th_an	oh
2016-09-27 12:36:13	keveloper	before i just stored the username in the session
2016-09-27 12:36:18	keveloper	in the old version
2016-09-27 12:37:18	keveloper	i just did like session.setAttribute("userId", user) or something
2016-09-27 12:37:40	keveloper	for password i've done the default sql hashing
2016-09-27 12:37:42	keveloper	whatever it has
2016-09-27 12:38:00	keveloper	I think I used SHA1?
2016-09-27 12:38:03	na_th_an	idk if I just overthink web development or if I don't fully understand it but it just seems so totally fucked
2016-09-27 12:38:03	keveloper	maybe MD5
2016-09-27 12:38:07	na_th_an	there are so many pieces
2016-09-27 12:38:11	na_th_an	it's impossible to get it all right
2016-09-27 12:38:11	keveloper	lol
2016-09-27 12:38:13	keveloper	yeah
2016-09-27 12:38:22	keveloper	how i HAVE done auth with passwords before is this:
2016-09-27 12:38:35	na_th_an	if you used MD5 I'm going to hit you
2016-09-27 12:38:38	keveloper	send user and pass in plain text over http (obviously incorrect)
2016-09-27 12:39:06	keveloper	when storing pass in the database use MySQL to do the hash i dont remember wha tit was
2016-09-27 12:39:22	keveloper	I think I used MD5
2016-09-27 12:39:29	keveloper	this was like 3 years ago
2016-09-27 12:40:08	na_th_an	DC literally doesn't log anything when this exception happens
2016-09-27 12:40:14	na_th_an	:(
2016-09-27 12:40:17	keveloper	then when you login it checks that with the MD5 hash in the db then if it was successful then I did session.setAttribute("user", user)
2016-09-27 12:40:32	na_th_an	for the love of god you did not use md5
2016-09-27 12:40:51	keveloper	then for auth i just did if (session.getAttribute("user") != null) //do whatever
2016-09-27 12:40:53	keveloper	else not logged in
2016-09-27 12:41:05	keveloper	so yeah dont do it that way but thats what i've done
2016-09-27 12:41:09	keveloper	it was a school project
2016-09-27 12:41:15	keveloper	no one actually used it
2016-09-27 12:41:19	keveloper	yes i used MD5 hash
2016-09-27 12:41:21	keveloper	it was the easiest
2016-09-27 12:41:23	na_th_an	:O
2016-09-27 12:41:25	keveloper	and also like 3 years ago
2016-09-27 12:41:27	na_th_an	keveloper--
2016-09-27 12:41:31	na_th_an	no excuse for md5
2016-09-27 12:42:05	keveloper	ugh jeez lemme check what i used
2016-09-27 12:42:11	na_th_an	lol
2016-09-27 12:44:30	keveloper	I used the PASSWORD() function
2016-09-27 12:44:33	keveloper	of MySQL
2016-09-27 12:44:50	keveloper	no idea hwat is used
2016-09-27 12:45:28	keveloper	"The PASSWORD() function is used by the authentication system in MySQL Server; you should not use it in your own applications."
2016-09-27 12:45:29	keveloper	lmao
2016-09-27 12:45:36	keveloper	I should've used SHA2() apparently
2016-09-27 12:45:48	keveloper	so is it fine to just take a plain text password and give it to the SQL function SHA2()
2016-09-27 12:46:01	keveloper	like what is the "right" way to do that
2016-09-27 12:46:56	na_th_an	well you should be sending passwords over SSL
2016-09-27 12:47:06	na_th_an	so there's some protection there as they are in transport to the server
2016-09-27 12:47:22	na_th_an	I think sending a plain password over SSL isn't THAT big of a deal, but it can be cached or something
2016-09-27 12:47:33	keveloper	well duh
2016-09-27 12:47:43	na_th_an	I think client-side salting and hashing is preferred?
2016-09-27 12:47:45	keveloper	whats the better way to do it
2016-09-27 12:47:48	na_th_an	but not that big of a deal
2016-09-27 12:47:58	na_th_an	and then once you get the client-side salted and hashed password
2016-09-27 12:47:59	keveloper	so you client-side has and salt, send over SSL, store that?
2016-09-27 12:48:04	na_th_an	you salt and hash it again on the server
2016-09-27 12:48:07	keveloper	okay
2016-09-27 12:48:11	keveloper	im gonna make cluttr SO SECURE lol
2016-09-27 12:48:21	na_th_an	anything on the client can be reverse engineered
2016-09-27 12:48:45	na_th_an	but really, don't roll your own auth is the right way to do it
2016-09-27 12:48:49	keveloper	so I should client side SHA-2, salt, send over SSL, SHA-2 encrypt again on server with salt, save to DB
2016-09-27 12:48:57	keveloper	well duh
2016-09-27 12:49:06	na_th_an	the most "should" option is to use oauth2
2016-09-27 12:49:21	keveloper	ugh
2016-09-27 12:49:34	keveloper	i have no idea how to use oauth2
2016-09-27 12:49:41	na_th_an	it's p easy with springboot I think
2016-09-27 12:49:48	na_th_an	https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-oauth2/
2016-09-27 12:50:00	keveloper	...
2016-09-27 12:50:01	keveloper	@EnableOAuth2Sso
2016-09-27 12:50:02	keveloper	lolol
2016-09-27 12:50:47	keveloper	so i should just do sign on with google and facebook
2016-09-27 12:50:50	keveloper	and store any of my own stuff
2016-09-27 12:51:02	na_th_an	ya prolly
2016-09-27 12:51:21	keveloper	hmmm
2016-09-27 12:51:36	na_th_an	I have no idea 
2016-09-27 12:51:40	na_th_an	about this DC stuff
2016-09-27 12:51:46	na_th_an	I give up
2016-09-27 12:51:51	na_th_an	I have no idea why it's failing in dev
2016-09-27 12:51:55	na_th_an	and I have no idea how to figure it out
2016-09-27 12:52:32	keveloper	yep
2016-09-27 12:53:18	keveloper	i'll probably do my own sign in as well as facebook and google
2016-09-27 13:27:32	keveloper	omg that worked
2016-09-27 13:27:44	na_th_an	worked how
2016-09-27 13:27:51	keveloper	all of the _dev files
2016-09-27 13:27:54	keveloper	copied from CI
2016-09-27 13:28:03	na_th_an	andd then what
2016-09-27 13:28:08	keveloper	nothing yet
2016-09-27 13:28:09	na_th_an	what failed before that works now
2016-09-27 13:28:13	keveloper	just the bash command
2016-09-27 13:28:14	na_th_an	oh
2016-09-27 13:28:23	keveloper	how could i test that that quickly
2016-09-27 13:28:30	keveloper	you could run DC on local right
2016-09-27 13:28:31	na_th_an	that's what I was confused about
2016-09-27 13:28:39	na_th_an	I ran it on local but I only got 403's
2016-09-27 13:28:44	na_th_an	I never figured out why
2016-09-27 13:28:48	na_th_an	even with CI config
2016-09-27 13:28:54	na_th_an	and ying got 403's as well running locally
2016-09-27 13:29:14	na_th_an	idk how to test it
2016-09-27 13:30:20	keveloper	this rashmi and bill convo lol
2016-09-27 13:31:43	na_th_an	I can't hear ait
2016-09-27 13:31:43	keveloper	okay building with changes

2016-09-27 13:33:08	keveloper	dropped it today and cracked the screen
2016-09-27 13:33:24	na_th_an	I bet you could get it fixed from samsung
2016-09-27 13:33:32	na_th_an	honestly sounds like an engineering defect if it broke that soon
2016-09-27 13:33:38	na_th_an	those screens are supposed to be pretty strong
2016-09-27 13:33:51	keveloper	no case or screen protector
2016-09-27 13:33:55	na_th_an	still
2016-09-27 13:34:06	na_th_an	they're supposed to be rated for like 2m fall distance I think
2016-09-27 13:34:21	na_th_an	you might be able to get that fixed under warranty
2016-09-27 13:34:24	na_th_an	but also
2016-09-27 13:34:29	na_th_an	how do girls crack their screens so much ffs

2016-09-27 13:41:17	na_th_an	how did you test it 
2016-09-27 13:41:45	keveloper	health check
2016-09-27 13:41:51	na_th_an	local?
2016-09-27 13:41:55	na_th_an	or in DEV?
2016-09-27 13:41:59	keveloper	DEV
2016-09-27 13:42:05	na_th_an	how did you do that without a pull request
2016-09-27 13:43:12	keveloper	feature branch
2016-09-27 13:43:26	keveloper	build a branch , deploy to DEV
2016-09-27 13:43:33	keveloper	you can deploy and build anywhere
2016-09-27 14:21:56	keveloper	hmmm
2016-09-27 14:22:04	keveloper	how can i verify what properties file something is using
2016-09-27 14:22:08	na_th_an	no clue
2016-09-27 14:25:53	keveloper	if (!$envFound) {
2016-09-27 14:25:53	keveloper	        unshift (@{$options->{deployEnvs}}, "dev");
2016-09-27 14:25:53	keveloper	        }
2016-09-27 14:25:54	keveloper	found it
2016-09-27 14:27:43	na_th_an	yay I was right

2016-10-13 10:47:54	keveloper	existing envs
2016-10-13 10:47:59	keveloper	because they are code changes

2016-10-13 10:59:35	keveloper	for testing up to NAT we can do prodfix releases from a branch

2016-10-13 11:00:31	keveloper	and hopefully we won't have to
2016-10-13 11:00:39	keveloper	depending on when xserves are getting decommissioned
2016-10-13 11:00:50	na_th_an	so we can just keep making changes on the snowflake branch and releasing from that?

2016-10-24 08:41:56	keveloper	and i was like uh ok
2016-10-24 08:42:13	keveloper	and i was bored af and alone so i was like whatever and texted her like "hey whats up whyd you follow me"
2016-10-24 08:42:26	keveloper	and then we caught up for a bit
2016-10-24 08:42:45	keveloper	then she got annoying as to be expected so i was like "im going to bed" and blacklisted her
2016-10-24 08:43:12	keveloper	then sunday was her birthday so i was like what the hell "happy birthday!"
2016-10-24 08:43:49	keveloper	then we talked a bit, then i could tell she was about to ask to hang out and i noped away and blocked her number
2016-10-24 08:44:00	keveloper	then she liked and commented on some old insta stuff again so i blocked her instagram
2016-10-24 08:44:17	keveloper	and i was like "why the fuck did i text her dammit.. okay done talking to her that was stupid"
2016-10-24 08:44:28	keveloper	and i didnt tell emily becuase i figured it would just upset her right
2016-10-24 08:44:38	keveloper	and she would be better off not knowing
2016-10-24 08:44:44	keveloper	so then last night
2016-10-24 08:44:48	keveloper	when me and emily were in bed
2016-10-24 08:45:17	keveloper	some random person (one of lindsey's friends) message emily on instagram like "hey i dont know you but im friends with lindsey and he has been texting her the past few days"
2016-10-24 08:45:21	keveloper	and sends screenshots with that
2016-10-24 08:45:27	keveloper	and emily is like wtf

2016-10-24 08:47:24	keveloper	because lindsey and I hung out in dublin for like 3 years and now i live in dublin so its hard not to think about her and its dumb

2016-10-27 10:40:45	keveloper	it sounds like he wants a redirect with the param appended to it
2016-10-27 10:40:55	keveloper	i think he's talking about URL params

2016-10-27 10:41:20	keveloper	yeah you can redirect to something and just append whatever to the URL
2016-10-27 10:41:44	keveloper	sounds like he needs to restructure what he's doing
2016-10-27 10:41:54	keveloper	and save something in the session or something
2016-10-27 10:42:43	na_th_an	idk what he's trying to do but you can't append query params in a 302 redirect

2016-10-27 13:07:41	keveloper	Looks like you just need a large flat surface; adhere some sandpaper to it, place your case face down and go to town.
2016-10-27 13:07:48	keveloper	from the thread lol
2016-10-27 13:09:01	keveloper	yeah it looks like he literally just put the case face down on sand paper
2016-10-27 13:10:26	na_th_an	I'm sure that's one way to do it
2016-10-27 13:11:12	keveloper	my dad has a

2016-10-27 13:12:45	na_th_an	you'd probably have the most luck with a belt sander
2016-10-27 13:12:54	keveloper	idk man lol

2016-10-31 09:42:26	keveloper	i trust her to know what drugs do
2016-10-31 09:42:41	na_th_an	some doctors don't know much about using drugs recreationally
2016-10-31 09:42:47	na_th_an	but that's mostly older ones
2016-10-31 09:43:00	keveloper	yeah i did fine
2016-10-31 09:43:09	na_th_an	you should at least know what kind of drugs you're doing
2016-10-31 09:43:14	keveloper	i think it was anxiety medicine or something
2016-10-31 09:43:17	na_th_an	that's like drug safety tip #1
2016-10-31 09:43:20	na_th_an	was it xanax

2016-10-31 09:43:26	keveloper	and i was like dope
2016-10-31 09:43:27	na_th_an	because mixing xanax and alcohol is really bad
2016-10-31 09:43:28	keveloper	no it was not
2016-10-31 09:43:35	na_th_an	or any kind of benzo

2016-10-31 09:43:41	na_th_an	alproazilam

2016-10-31 09:43:57	keveloper	idk lol
2016-10-31 09:44:14	na_th_an	that's probably a benzo
2016-10-31 09:44:23	na_th_an	and mixing benzos with alcohol is p dangerous
2016-10-31 09:44:32	keveloper	i took a single small pill
2016-10-31 09:44:42	na_th_an	which is still p dangerous when mixed with alcohol
2016-10-31 09:44:49	na_th_an	they both hit GABA receptors
2016-10-31 09:44:59	na_th_an	it's really easy to black out when mixing even small amounts of benzos with alcohol
2016-10-31 09:45:12	keveloper	well i did fine
2016-10-31 09:45:29	na_th_an	watch out man
2016-10-31 09:45:36	keveloper	i do it so often so
2016-10-31 09:45:55	na_th_an	you only need to black out on benzos once to do something really stupid

2016-11-01 10:01:02	keveloper	lol
2016-11-01 10:01:15	na_th_an	i'm just gonna talk about my keyboard for an hour and a half
2016-11-01 10:01:23	keveloper	a bunch of disabled live integration tests because managers want the board to be green but dont give us time to fix it
2016-11-01 10:01:27	keveloper	lolol
2016-11-01 10:01:36	keveloper	its not gonna take an hour to talk about testing
2016-11-01 10:01:43	na_th_an	"do you know about ALPS and cherry mx stems?"
2016-11-01 10:01:54	na_th_an	"what about linear response curves and tactile bumps"
2016-11-01 10:01:55	keveloper	im also gonna be like "i havent coded here in like 2 or 3 months so i dont really remember"
2016-11-01 10:02:00	na_th_an	ya same
2016-11-01 10:02:37	keveloper	"i think we have like 2 javascript unit tests"
2016-11-01 10:02:54	keveloper	"canned/mock/live thats it k bye"
2016-11-01 10:03:06	keveloper	what is mock integration
2016-11-01 10:03:31	keveloper	wtf are these load tests in quickbuild
2016-11-01 10:03:32	keveloper	for DIU
2016-11-01 10:03:34	keveloper	DUI
2016-11-01 10:03:39	na_th_an	mock integration runs in a mock spring profile I think
2016-11-01 10:03:46	na_th_an	it like, sets up a spring application context
2016-11-01 10:03:58	na_th_an	and it runs tests against the code
2016-11-01 10:04:01	keveloper	why do we have all these different types of integration tests
2016-11-01 10:04:07	na_th_an	but it doesn't actually start an HTTP test or anything
2016-11-01 10:04:12	na_th_an	HTTP server
2016-11-01 10:04:19	na_th_an	because we're bad at testing
2016-11-01 10:04:21	keveloper	lol
2016-11-01 10:04:25	na_th_an	and QA kinda sucks here
2016-11-01 10:04:32	keveloper	whats a pro of canned testing
2016-11-01 10:04:59	na_th_an	you can do live integration testing and expect certain data and have it be consistent
2016-11-01 10:05:11	na_th_an	the real reason we did it was never actually implemented
2016-11-01 10:05:19	keveloper	lol
2016-11-01 10:05:19	na_th_an	the idea was, say you need a record with a certain attribute
2016-11-01 10:05:26	na_th_an	or you need to talk to the PRB and get some response back
2016-11-01 10:05:32	na_th_an	you'd use the canned server to mock this response
2016-11-01 10:05:45	na_th_an	like, you could go in and configure it to return a certain response when you make the request
2016-11-01 10:05:46	keveloper	ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
2016-11-01 10:05:49	keveloper	ahhhhh
2016-11-01 10:05:52	keveloper	OHHHH
2016-11-01 10:05:54	keveloper	everything just clicked
2016-11-01 10:05:56	na_th_an	so we wouldn't have to wait for records to be loaded and shit like that
2016-11-01 10:06:09	na_th_an	but then the project was dropped and never implemented 
2016-11-01 10:06:11	keveloper	you use canned external responses
2016-11-01 10:06:12	na_th_an	and the guy who wrote TRS left
2016-11-01 10:06:13	keveloper	OKAY
2016-11-01 10:06:18	na_th_an	yes jeez lol
2016-11-01 10:06:18	keveloper	that makes SO much more sense
2016-11-01 10:06:29	keveloper	i thought it was like canned responses of DUI
2016-11-01 10:06:31	na_th_an	I was wondering why you were having trouble with it yesterday
2016-11-01 10:06:34	na_th_an	no lol
2016-11-01 10:06:38	na_th_an	it sits between DUI and the outside world
2016-11-01 10:06:38	keveloper	and like live integration remember what DUI responded
2016-11-01 10:06:40	keveloper	i was like
2016-11-01 10:06:40	na_th_an	in a proxy

2016-11-01 15:54:17	keveloper	that means nothing to me
2016-11-01 15:54:45	na_th_an	he's saying that you can use a web proxy to mutate the response from the existing server
2016-11-01 15:54:49	keveloper	ohhhh
2016-11-01 15:54:58	keveloper	i thought he was responding to the image person
2016-11-01 15:54:59	na_th_an	or you can wrap the existing app in an iframe
2016-11-01 15:55:16	keveloper	yeah i get it now i thought he was talking about the image guy
2016-11-01 16:00:27	na_th_an	ok jeff, because I was supposed to get that "dev is secure and qa is not" means that they use different protocols to communicate
2016-11-01 16:00:36	na_th_an	you could not have made that clearer, it was entirely my bad
2016-11-01 16:03:58	na_th_an	yo sup

2016-11-01 16:15:33	na_th_an	I don't know but I'm embarrased at mark's ability to debug and explain problems is fucking awful for a senior development

2016-11-01 16:15:59	keveloper	what havent we changed
2016-11-01 16:16:00	na_th_an	he can't explain it
2016-11-01 16:16:12	na_th_an	he's like "I get different results when I use the CI properties and the DEV properties"
2016-11-01 16:16:18	na_th_an	like no shit, they're pointing at totally different things
2016-11-01 16:16:28	na_th_an	he says like "OWC is pointing at the DRConfig" 
2016-11-01 16:16:38	na_th_an	and I'm like "what owc? isn't drconfig a mysql database?"
2016-11-01 16:16:45	na_th_an	and then he actually meant discoverconfig
2016-11-01 16:16:46	keveloper	OWC is pointing at remediated stuff
2016-11-01 16:16:48	na_th_an	and I have no idea
2016-11-01 16:16:53	na_th_an	OV OWC?

2016-11-01 16:17:14	na_th_an	over the course of 3 days
2016-11-01 16:17:23	na_th_an	I have no idea what the fuck he's doing and he can't explain it to me
2016-11-01 16:17:29	keveloper	ov owc is pointing at dev DC and dev DR

2016-11-01 16:18:17	keveloper	probably because he doesnt know

2016-11-03 16:06:20	keveloper	fhjiosda;fjhdsoifjdsioa;fj
2016-11-03 16:06:29	na_th_an	"And didn't think it was neccessary to ask or tell them"
2016-11-03 16:06:41	keveloper	lol
2016-11-03 16:07:48	keveloper	You can assume at this point that we’ve made plenty of jokes at your expense regarding the mistake.
2016-11-03 16:08:01	keveloper	wow so funny i gave you the wrong port because the amp farms are misconfigured
2016-11-03 16:08:03	keveloper	fuck you mike
2016-11-03 16:08:36	na_th_an	whatever email you're talking about I don't have
2016-11-03 16:08:42	keveloper	i know lol
2016-11-03 16:08:49	keveloper	mike took you off of it
2016-11-03 16:08:53	keveloper	(why?)
2016-11-03 16:08:56	keveloper	(i dunno)
2016-11-03 16:09:09	keveloper	it was the "Lists has stopped" one
2016-11-03 16:09:29	na_th_an	no you just copied me on the email for no reason
2016-11-03 16:09:35	na_th_an	and mike fixed your mistake
2016-11-03 16:09:36	keveloper	lolol
2016-11-03 16:09:40	keveloper	fucking mike
2016-11-03 16:09:44	keveloper	i wanna leave
2016-11-03 16:09:48	keveloper	okay
2016-11-03 16:09:51	keveloper	things i can do before i leave
2016-11-03 16:10:00	keveloper	1) switch DR to use farms instead of hosts
2016-11-03 16:10:04	keveloper	2) put farm password files in NIT
2016-11-03 16:10:57	na_th_an	it's very possible that this DR NAT issue I've been working on is because there's an old version of DR in NAT
2016-11-03 16:11:06	na_th_an	and I was developing off of old DR shit and needed to pull
2016-11-03 16:11:19	na_th_an	and if we just installed the most recent version of DR into NAT then this would be fixed
2016-11-03 16:11:25	keveloper	wait what
2016-11-03 16:11:26	na_th_an	and I spent 3 days messing around in DR for nothing
2016-11-03 16:11:30	keveloper	i've installed DR to NAT a lot
2016-11-03 16:11:34	keveloper	so that doesnt sound correct
2016-11-03 16:11:35	na_th_an	the latest DR release in NAT is 1.7
2016-11-03 16:11:45	keveloper	wat
2016-11-03 16:12:02	keveloper	oh u right
2016-11-03 16:12:03	keveloper	huh
2016-11-03 16:12:55	na_th_an	so if we install DR into NAT I think this is going to be fixed... hopefully... maybe
2016-11-03 16:13:08	na_th_an	I ended up making the same changes to the firefly host from the old SRU properties that you did
2016-11-03 16:13:15	na_th_an	just like, totally duplicated work
2016-11-03 16:13:22	keveloper	oh
2016-11-03 16:13:23	na_th_an	idk what I've been doing this week

2016-11-04 08:43:52	keveloper	the pole lead type thing

2016-11-04 08:44:17	keveloper	it sounds like a pitch shifted pole lead
2016-11-04 08:44:18	keveloper	but idk
2016-11-04 08:44:55	na_th_an	you didn't? :O
2016-11-04 08:45:01	keveloper	what
2016-11-04 08:45:25	na_th_an	you didn't expect me to know?

2016-11-04 08:46:40	keveloper	:O
2016-11-04 09:14:48	keveloper	what is mock integration
2016-11-04 09:15:51	na_th_an	zach could tell you better
2016-11-04 09:16:04	na_th_an	but i think it stands up a spring profile
2016-11-04 09:16:09	na_th_an	and does testing
2016-11-04 09:16:13	na_th_an	but not through http
2016-11-04 09:16:35	na_th_an	you could look at some of the tests and see what exactly they do for setup
2016-11-04 09:16:38	na_th_an	idx
2016-11-04 09:16:40	na_th_an	idk *
2016-11-04 09:18:36	keveloper	do we even run mock integration
2016-11-04 09:18:39	keveloper	when does that happen
2016-11-04 09:18:45	keveloper	is that at build itme
2016-11-04 09:18:59	na_th_an	ya
2016-11-04 09:20:51	keveloper	so it just like mocks the domain objects and stuff?
2016-11-04 09:21:16	na_th_an	idk what it mocks
2016-11-04 09:21:25	na_th_an	mock http requests
2016-11-04 09:21:29	na_th_an	I think
2016-11-04 09:21:34	na_th_an	but like I've said i don't really know
2016-11-04 09:21:45	na_th_an	so I wouldn't go telling this to someone else as fact without verifying it
2016-11-04 09:21:50	na_th_an	I've never written a mock integration test
2016-11-04 09:23:22	keveloper	they mock the SALs
2016-11-04 09:23:29	keveloper	"usually"
2016-11-04 09:23:49	na_th_an	oh yeah that makes sense
2016-11-04 09:24:12	keveloper	thats the last layer before http requests righ
2016-11-04 09:25:49	na_th_an	SALs do the http request
2016-11-04 09:25:55	keveloper	ya
2016-11-04 09:26:01	keveloper	k coo
2016-11-04 09:26:09	keveloper	"it’s integration of all of our server side code. controller -> ESL/assembler/service -> SAL -> realish mock data"
2016-11-04 09:26:11	keveloper	said zach
2016-11-04 09:27:08	keveloper	what else about testing lol
2016-11-04 09:27:14	keveloper	we run live integration and canned from quickbuild
2016-11-04 09:27:21	na_th_an	ya
2016-11-04 09:27:35	keveloper	codenarc runs on unit tests too

2016-11-07 08:52:51	na_th_an	I need to figure out how to do database migrations in h2 and spring boot
2016-11-07 08:53:08	keveloper	huh
2016-11-07 08:53:09	na_th_an	that's one of the last technical things I need to figure out
2016-11-07 08:53:09	keveloper	why
2016-11-07 08:53:14	na_th_an	ascient
2016-11-07 08:53:19	na_th_an	production database
2016-11-07 08:53:22	keveloper	what are you migrating
2016-11-07 08:53:22	na_th_an	is persistent
2016-11-07 08:53:34	na_th_an	I think you're confused on what a database migration is
2016-11-07 08:53:44	na_th_an	"Migrations are a convenient way to alter your database schema over time in a consistent and easy way"
2016-11-07 08:54:23	keveloper	oh
2016-11-07 08:56:24	na_th_an	they're basically like "this is version one of the database" then you do alter tables to get version 2
2016-11-07 08:56:30	na_th_an	you can generally migrate up or down
2016-11-07 08:56:37	na_th_an	I think liquibase is what I want
2016-11-07 08:56:43	na_th_an	ruby on rails does it really well
2016-11-07 08:57:13	na_th_an	yo, is the status on the spreadsheet correct for DRConfig, placehold, and etc
2016-11-07 08:57:18	na_th_an	elink

2016-11-07 08:58:44	na_th_an	w/e
2016-11-07 08:58:56	na_th_an	we can blame stephen

2016-11-07 09:00:41	na_th_an	I mean we have those files to look at but not that much to do there
2016-11-07 09:00:49	na_th_an	firstsearch and owc are both priority
2016-11-07 09:00:50	keveloper	ok
2016-11-07 09:01:34	keveloper	like why isnt it doing the substitution
2016-11-07 09:01:34	keveloper	Sending:: GET http://#WCLID#.worldcat-m1.dev.oclc.org/oclc/1767509/openurl?ip=1

2016-11-07 09:08:42	na_th_an	idk
2016-11-07 09:09:06	keveloper	the /controller thing is what was failing until we got sybase working

2016-11-07 09:10:02	keveloper	91475
2016-11-07 09:10:06	keveloper	21274 was the broken one

2016-11-07 10:55:22	keveloper	HAS TO
2016-11-07 10:55:41	na_th_an	I bet they were secretly sacrificing lambs to trump
2016-11-07 10:55:46	na_th_an	and drinking the lamb blood
2016-11-07 10:55:49	na_th_an	while chanting "trump"
2016-11-07 10:55:54	na_th_an	and giving thanks to the trump statue
2016-11-07 10:56:08	keveloper	probably
2016-11-07 10:56:14	na_th_an	it's the most likely explanation
2016-11-07 10:56:32	keveloper	do you think they will ever date
2016-11-07 10:56:39	na_th_an	idk maybe
2016-11-07 10:56:46	na_th_an	they've both been single for as long as I've known them

2016-11-07 10:57:41	keveloper	i dated in college im fine
2016-11-07 10:57:49	na_th_an	I think she didn't have any luck freshman and sophomore year

2016-11-07 10:58:01	keveloper	yeah guess so

2016-11-22 09:59:28	na_th_an	is this two songs mashed together
2016-11-22 09:59:30	na_th_an	because I think it is
2016-11-22 09:59:39	keveloper	is this right http://circncip-m1.prt.oclc.org
2016-11-22 09:59:45	na_th_an	wait
2016-11-22 09:59:46	keveloper	no its just bad
2016-11-22 09:59:47	na_th_an	lol
2016-11-22 09:59:59	na_th_an	I accidentally started playing my music in the background
2016-11-22 10:00:05	keveloper	oh
2016-11-22 10:00:07	na_th_an	at the same time as I was playing the song you linked
2016-11-22 10:00:07	keveloper	its also bad tho
2016-11-22 10:00:19	keveloper	the non rapping parts arent that bad
2016-11-22 10:00:21	keveloper	but the rapping
2016-11-22 10:00:22	na_th_an	so how about kanye
2016-11-22 10:00:26	keveloper	huh
2016-11-22 10:00:33	na_th_an	have you not heard about kanye
2016-11-22 10:00:36	keveloper	i havent been in touch with the world since saturday
2016-11-22 10:00:53	na_th_an	well I tihnk it was saturday night he had a concert and went on a rant for 18 minutes
2016-11-22 10:01:04	na_th_an	about how hotling bling wasn't good and him and kid cudi are visionaries
2016-11-22 10:01:05	keveloper	this seems why thats happening lol
2016-11-22 10:01:05	keveloper	http://circncip-m1.prt.oclc.org/
2016-11-22 10:01:21	na_th_an	circncip?
2016-11-22 10:01:23	na_th_an	I've never seen that url
2016-11-22 10:01:35	na_th_an	but anyway he went on a huge rant and everyone was like "This guy is crazy"
2016-11-22 10:01:41	na_th_an	and he cancelled the rest of his north america tour
2016-11-22 10:01:49	na_th_an	yesterday he was admitted into the hospital
2016-11-22 10:01:57	na_th_an	he seems to be having a manic episode of some kind
2016-11-22 10:02:10	keveloper	kid cudi sucks
2016-11-22 10:02:21	na_th_an	I don't like him or kanye
2016-11-22 10:02:27	keveloper	i like some of kanye's music
2016-11-22 10:02:31	keveloper	but kid cudi is just trash
2016-11-22 10:02:32	na_th_an	some of it is okay
2016-11-22 10:02:35	keveloper	like none of his music is good
2016-11-22 10:02:41	na_th_an	I've never heard a whole song by kanye that I like
2016-11-22 10:02:45	na_th_an	but parts of songs ya
2016-11-22 10:02:49	keveloper	gold digger?
2016-11-22 10:02:58	na_th_an	I feel like there's maybe 1 or 2 kid cudi songs I think are ok
2016-11-22 10:03:04	na_th_an	uhh maybe I haven't heard that song in a long time
2016-11-22 10:03:10	keveloper	no they are trash and his voice is annoying
2016-11-22 10:03:18	na_th_an	I'm really not sure
2016-11-22 10:03:36	na_th_an	kid cudi and kanye are the two artists I always end up skipping on google play
2016-11-22 10:06:01	na_th_an	all the PRT Circulation things are marked verified on the status spreadsheet
2016-11-22 10:06:15	keveloper	um
2016-11-22 10:06:18	keveloper	guys
2016-11-22 10:06:23	na_th_an	email
2016-11-22 10:06:27	na_th_an	#thebestide
2016-11-22 10:09:52	keveloper	can confirm it is because that farm doesn't response
2016-11-22 10:09:55	keveloper	respond
2016-11-22 10:10:19	na_th_an	how do you know
2016-11-22 10:10:30	keveloper	because i looked through the code
2016-11-22 10:10:58	na_th_an	I looked through it and thought it was using a circ url from the drconfig so I changed that yesterday but it didn't fix it
2016-11-22 10:11:07	na_th_an	because its drconfig had circavl.prod.oclc.org
2016-11-22 10:11:13	keveloper	you looked through circulatinoservlet?
2016-11-22 10:11:15	na_th_an	so I changed that to NAT
2016-11-22 10:11:18	na_th_an	but no dice
2016-11-22 10:11:30	na_th_an	no circulationservlet
2016-11-22 10:11:48	na_th_an	customInst.getWmsCirculationUrl()
2016-11-22 10:11:55	keveloper	it does this 
2016-11-22 10:11:56	na_th_an	I was guessing that customInst was drConfig shit
2016-11-22 10:11:57	keveloper	CirculationService circulationService = AbstractCirculationService.getInstance(circulationDataCenterURL);
2016-11-22 10:12:06	keveloper	and circulationDataCenterURL is the thing that doesn't responde
2016-11-22 10:12:18	keveloper	then it uses that service to get stuff
2016-11-22 10:12:25	keveloper	then it obviously doesn't get anything
2016-11-22 10:12:42	keveloper	then it fails on a nullptr here
2016-11-22 10:12:42	keveloper	long totalRequestCount = requestSummary.getTotalRequestCount().longValue();
2016-11-22 10:13:04	na_th_an	ya I saw that
2016-11-22 10:13:29	keveloper	requestSummary comes from patronsummary
2016-11-22 10:13:36	na_th_an	ya I know
2016-11-22 10:13:39	keveloper	patronSummary comes from userCirculationItems
2016-11-22 10:13:40	na_th_an	I looked at all this yesterday
2016-11-22 10:13:48	keveloper	that comes from circulationService
2016-11-22 10:13:53	keveloper	right
2016-11-22 10:13:54	keveloper	so
2016-11-22 10:14:01	na_th_an	I'm not arguing
2016-11-22 10:14:17	keveloper	that is why i think it is caused by the circ farm thing
2016-11-22 10:14:44	na_th_an	come here tho
2016-11-22 10:14:50	keveloper	k
2016-11-22 10:17:06	na_th_an	http://circavl-m1.nat.oclc.org is in the drconfig for 91475
2016-11-22 10:18:05	keveloper	hm
2016-11-22 10:18:11	keveloper	is it pointing to the right drconfig
2016-11-22 10:18:16	na_th_an	it should be
2016-11-22 10:18:24	keveloper	its pointing to dr nat
2016-11-22 10:19:12	keveloper	yeah that other circfarm is the default
2016-11-22 10:19:20	na_th_an	either way we should probably email circ about that url that's failing
2016-11-22 10:19:25	keveloper	it appends this to it
2016-11-22 10:19:25	keveloper	/ncip-v2-bl-service/ncip/wcl
2016-11-22 10:19:31	keveloper	to whatever url you give
2016-11-22 10:19:36	keveloper	can you check that with the url you have
2016-11-22 10:19:52	na_th_an	404
2016-11-22 10:19:57	na_th_an	wait
2016-11-22 10:19:59	na_th_an	ya
2016-11-22 10:20:16	na_th_an	mark is dying
2016-11-22 10:20:22	keveloper	it also does this 
2016-11-22 10:20:23	keveloper	NCIPCirculationServiceBaseURL + "/chili/rest/patron/cancelRequestItem?circulationDataCenterURL=" + dataCenterURL;
2016-11-22 10:20:30	keveloper	so it uses the NCIP thing also
2016-11-22 10:20:41	keveloper	AVAILABILITY_SERVICE_BASE_URL=http://circncip-m1.prt.oclc.org
2016-11-22 10:20:41	na_th_an	I wouldn't be surprised if that circ url is why it's failing
2016-11-22 10:20:43	keveloper	that guy
2016-11-22 10:20:44	na_th_an	even though we don't know why
2016-11-22 10:20:46	na_th_an	by looking at the code
2016-11-22 10:21:09	keveloper	so it is using two URLs from circ that both dont work
2016-11-22 10:21:11	keveloper	AVAILABILITY_SERVICE_BASE_URL=http://circncip-m1.prt.oclc.org
2016-11-22 10:21:14	keveloper	http://circavl-m1.nat.oclc.org/ncip-v2-bl-service/ncip/wcl
2016-11-22 10:21:31	na_th_an	yes 404
2016-11-22 10:22:00	keveloper	line 72 of AbstractCirculationService
2016-11-22 10:22:17	keveloper	getInstance(String..) method
2016-11-22 10:22:24	keveloper	is where all of the URL stuff happens
2016-11-22 10:22:32	na_th_an	email circ and ask them wtf is up
2016-11-22 10:22:38	na_th_an	seriously that's probably it 
2016-11-22 10:22:50	na_th_an	"hey circ wtf is up <url here>"
2016-11-22 10:23:32	keveloper	circ dev?
2016-11-22 10:24:24	na_th_an	idk
2016-11-22 10:25:27	keveloper	wait it never actually hits http://circavl-m1.nat.oclc.org/ncip-v2-bl-service/ncip/wcl
2016-11-22 10:25:29	keveloper	i dont think
2016-11-22 10:25:36	keveloper	it uses that as a URL query param
2016-11-22 10:26:58	keveloper	so
2016-11-22 10:27:04	keveloper	the actual URL it hits issssssssssssss
2016-11-22 10:27:04	keveloper	this
2016-11-22 10:27:05	keveloper	http://circncip-m1.prt.oclc.org/chili/rest/patron/lookupUser?circulationDataCenterURL=http://circavl-m1.nat.oclc.org/ncip-v2-bl-service/ncip/wcl&patron=%USER%&relying_party_id=urn:oclc:wms:da&registry_id=91475

2016-11-22 13:28:14	keveloper	from social
2016-11-22 13:28:26	keveloper	i wonder

2016-11-22 13:28:55	na_th_an	yup there he goes
2016-11-22 13:29:28	keveloper	i wonder if mark would have seen that 400 from a post with data and would have replicated it using curl to get the response
2016-11-22 13:30:11	na_th_an	it'd take him an hour and a half for sure
2016-11-22 13:30:34	na_th_an	what really pisses me off about talking to rashmi about a promotion was there was no discussion of being a better programmer or having technical skills or anything like that
2016-11-22 13:32:04	keveloper	that XML is valid
2016-11-22 13:32:16	keveloper	uhhh

2016-11-22 13:39:27	keveloper	you can just give data on a post in curl right
2016-11-22 13:39:31	keveloper	like
2016-11-22 13:39:36	keveloper	curl --data "blah" url.com
2016-11-22 13:39:55	keveloper	why does mark say okay all the tim
2016-11-22 13:40:04	na_th_an	you're doing "-X POST" right
2016-11-22 13:40:12	keveloper	he's like the guidance councelor from sp
2016-11-22 13:40:13	keveloper	no
2016-11-22 13:40:15	keveloper	whats that
2016-11-22 13:40:23	na_th_an	and because it makes it sound like he just got done with a lot of deep investigation instead of sleeping
2016-11-22 13:40:31	na_th_an	you have to change the request from GET to POST
2016-11-22 13:40:35	na_th_an	-X POST
2016-11-22 13:40:41	keveloper	--data makes it post
2016-11-22 13:40:46	na_th_an	no u
2016-11-22 13:40:54	keveloper	adding -X POST gives the same thing anyway
2016-11-22 13:41:04	keveloper	idk if this is like multipart
2016-11-22 13:41:04	na_th_an	does your curl need to set a header for the content type
2016-11-22 13:41:05	keveloper	or what

2016-11-22 13:53:19	na_th_an	probably social using http codes incorrectly
2016-11-22 13:53:46	keveloper	but it specifically says bad syntax
2016-11-22 13:53:57	keveloper	but i guess thats not something an OCLC dev wrote
2016-11-22 13:53:57	keveloper	so
2016-11-22 13:54:07	keveloper	is that the default 400 message in tomcat
2016-11-22 13:54:11	na_th_an	yeah but that's probably coming from the web server
2016-11-22 13:54:13	na_th_an	ya
2016-11-22 13:54:18	na_th_an	that's a default message for a 400 error

2016-11-22 15:29:38	keveloper	oh i doubt it

2016-11-22 15:30:07	keveloper	 Most banks are open on Nov. 25, but some might hold limited holiday hours, so if you know you need to stop by your local branch, call first to see if standard operating hours are in place.\

2016-12-01 09:19:18	na_th_an	#paradox

2016-12-01 09:19:54	keveloper	"SP made dsa caps for alps stems"
2016-12-01 09:19:56	keveloper	that sentence
2016-12-01 10:21:01	na_th_an	:@p
2016-12-01 10:21:08	keveloper	lol ya
2016-12-01 10:21:10	keveloper	wat
2016-12-01 10:21:56	na_th_an	have you looked at ying's thing at all
2016-12-01 10:22:25	keveloper	no -_-
2016-12-01 10:22:25	keveloper	i can
2016-12-01 10:22:27	keveloper	hold on
2016-12-01 10:33:52	na_th_an	you wanna look at lists or ying's thing
2016-12-01 10:33:57	na_th_an	or are you doing something else
2016-12-01 10:34:07	keveloper	i was looking at lists for a second
2016-12-01 10:34:10	keveloper	idk whats wrong with it
2016-12-01 10:34:13	keveloper	logs maybe
2016-12-01 10:34:23	na_th_an	yeah that's what I'd be looking at
2016-12-01 10:34:27	na_th_an	I have no idea what's wrong with it
2016-12-01 10:35:57	na_th_an	I'm gonna go see if ed's back
2016-12-01 10:36:15	keveloper	ok
2016-12-01 10:43:33	na_th_an	sup
2016-12-01 10:44:12	na_th_an	I told Ed about lists and he said he'd look at it but I wouldn't hold your breath
2016-12-01 10:46:21	keveloper	i have no idea what this ying issue is
2016-12-01 10:48:56	na_th_an	isn't this because NIT and RV are different environments
2016-12-01 10:49:02	na_th_an	they said their stuff talks to our RV stuff
2016-12-01 10:49:08	na_th_an	but the NIT service config talks to our NIT stuff
2016-12-01 10:49:11	na_th_an	not our RV stuff
2016-12-01 10:49:31	keveloper	well the first issue might be that jimmy vu installed non snowflake DR to NIT
2016-12-01 10:49:32	keveloper	so
2016-12-01 10:49:37	na_th_an	idk how we can get service config for our current RV stuff
2016-12-01 10:49:45	na_th_an	well
2016-12-01 10:49:48	na_th_an	ugh
2016-12-01 10:50:19	keveloper	if this has anything to do with DR that might be way
2016-12-01 10:50:30	na_th_an	service config nit uses nit discovery config which is configured with nit DR and nit DS
2016-12-01 10:50:32	na_th_an	right
2016-12-01 10:50:35	na_th_an	it's all nit
2016-12-01 10:50:40	keveloper	ya
2016-12-01 10:50:43	na_th_an	service config nit won't affect RV at all
2016-12-01 10:50:51	keveloper	correct
2016-12-01 10:51:56	keveloper	okay so people have been installing non snowflake DR that probably doesnt fully work to DEV and NIT
2016-12-01 10:52:05	na_th_an	wtf why
2016-12-01 10:52:13	keveloper	DR changes I assume idk
2016-12-01 10:53:51	keveloper	k so DR in DEV and NIT is currently missing
2016-12-01 10:54:02	na_th_an	missing?
2016-12-01 10:54:18	keveloper	Sybase, Firefly, Open URL Resolver but I think thats NAT
2016-12-01 10:54:32	na_th_an	huh?
2016-12-01 10:54:42	keveloper	DEV and NIT are missing those changes
2016-12-01 10:54:59	keveloper	and CircAvl
2016-12-01 10:55:01	keveloper	and KBWC
2016-12-01 10:55:08	na_th_an	dev and nit are fucked right now
2016-12-01 10:55:15	na_th_an	idk what you're trying to figure out by looking at this
2016-12-01 10:56:18	keveloper	the only reason this is on a branch is because the firefly switch
2016-12-01 10:56:25	na_th_an	I know
2016-12-01 10:56:36	keveloper	should we talk to zach and bryan about merging it
2016-12-01 10:56:45	na_th_an	probably
2016-12-01 10:57:06	keveloper	are zach or bryan here
2016-12-01 10:57:14	na_th_an	zach is out

2016-12-01 13:38:14	na_th_an	the other issue with that openurl shit is that the ds dev farm isn't cut ove

2016-12-08 08:57:42	keveloper	middleware has to teach us how to do it
2016-12-08 08:57:53	na_th_an	true
2016-12-08 08:58:04	keveloper	and we probably need access to quality too
2016-12-08 08:58:10	keveloper	and middleware probably doesnt want us to have that
2016-12-08 08:58:15	na_th_an	dude idk
2016-12-08 08:58:30	na_th_an	I assume middleware will be involved in this conversation

2016-12-08 10:07:22	na_th_an	that's what I'm trying to figure out
2016-12-08 10:09:33	na_th_an	we are verified in PRT aside from worldcat.org and Firstsearch
2016-12-08 10:09:43	keveloper	\o/

2016-12-08 10:13:23	keveloper	which one
2016-12-08 10:13:34	keveloper	its kinda close to nat
2016-12-08 10:13:46	na_th_an	if you go to amp and put in the IP you can look at the definition
2016-12-08 10:15:03	na_th_an	we have 5 things left in snowflake
2016-12-08 10:15:22	keveloper	avlfulws10nxm1.nat.oclc.org:8080 avlfulws11nxm1.nat.oclc.org:8080 
2016-12-08 10:15:23	na_th_an	AvailabilityQuery, DeliveryResolver, DiscoveryServices, DiscoverySessionCache, and DiscoveryUI
2016-12-08 10:15:35	keveloper	huh
2016-12-08 10:15:37	keveloper	oh
2016-12-08 10:15:48	na_th_an	those don't pass the tool
2016-12-08 10:17:21	keveloper	this makes no sense to me LBFarmMembership{worldkat:80}    Value is missing at NIT
2016-12-08 10:17:49	na_th_an	yeah it's kinda hard to read
2016-12-08 10:17:51	na_th_an	I can sorta explain it 
2016-12-08 10:18:14	na_th_an	but I feel like it might be wrong idk
2016-12-08 10:18:22	na_th_an	I can't find any issue here
2016-12-08 10:18:26	keveloper	what value is missing
2016-12-08 10:18:28	keveloper	the whole thing?
2016-12-08 10:18:47	na_th_an	it means that it can't find a matching value for the NIT environment
2016-12-08 10:19:03	keveloper	of the worldkat farm?
2016-12-08 10:19:09	na_th_an	ya
2016-12-08 10:19:11	keveloper	well obv
2016-12-08 10:19:15	keveloper	the an old dev farm

2016-12-08 10:19:39	keveloper	K
2016-12-08 10:20:04	na_th_an	"the an old dev farm" does not mean anything
2016-12-08 10:20:07	na_th_an	what do you mean by that
2016-12-08 10:21:18	keveloper	Isn't the worldkat:80 thing there because the dev worldkat is pointing at the new DEV DR
2016-12-08 10:21:24	keveloper	but that farm only exists in dev
2016-12-08 10:21:30	keveloper	so there wont be one for nit or nat
2016-12-08 10:21:42	na_th_an	what do you mean new dev dr that only exists in dev
2016-12-08 10:21:59	keveloper	yeah
2016-12-08 10:22:07	keveloper	10.232.0.54:80 is the NAT worldcat-m1 farm
2016-12-08 10:22:15	keveloper	obviously that wont be in DEV or NIT?
2016-12-08 10:22:20	keveloper	same with .231.
2016-12-08 10:22:24	na_th_an	yeah it normalizes the values
2016-12-08 10:22:27	na_th_an	it's supposed to
2016-12-08 10:22:31	keveloper	am i missing something or does this make no sense at all
2016-12-08 10:22:33	keveloper	what?
2016-12-08 10:22:39	na_th_an	you're right that it makes no sense
2016-12-08 10:22:43	na_th_an	but like look at this one
2016-12-08 10:22:45	na_th_an	http://dashboard.dsdc.oclc.org/global/snowflakes.cgi?report=currentValues&systemsBy=system&system=DeliveryResolverPlacehold&location=Dev%2CNIT%2CNAT&format=summary&category=&attributeType=&gen=1&.cgifields=noIgnore&.cgifields=location&.cgifields=existingSystemsOnly&.cgifields=differencesOnly
2016-12-08 10:22:50	na_th_an	see the LBFarmMembership
2016-12-08 10:23:30	keveloper	idfk
2016-12-08 10:24:35	keveloper	how do we go about fixing these
2016-12-08 10:24:39	keveloper	i dont even know what its saying
2016-12-08 10:24:42	na_th_an	email SRT nad never get a response

2016-12-08 10:24:53	na_th_an	well
2016-12-08 10:24:57	na_th_an	every one but this DR one
2016-12-08 10:25:13	na_th_an	DUI is doing something similar and idk why
2016-12-08 10:25:23	keveloper	wat does this bottom line mean
2016-12-08 10:25:30	na_th_an	I think this isn't detecting the farms correctly
2016-12-08 10:25:32	keveloper	worldkat:80 [2]
2016-12-08 10:25:39	keveloper	missing in nit and nat
2016-12-08 10:25:51	na_th_an	come here and i'll explain things easier than typing it out 
2016-12-08 10:26:12	na_th_an	it means that it can't find a matching farm config in nit and nat
2016-12-08 10:26:24	na_th_an	I think we should go ask your dad about this
2016-12-08 10:26:27	na_th_an	but town hall is in 15 min

2016-12-08 10:26:46	na_th_an	I think this is a problem with the report and how the farms are named
2016-12-08 10:27:57	na_th_an	oh I think I figured it out
2016-12-08 10:27:59	na_th_an	kinda

2016-12-09 09:05:57	keveloper	on the octane?
2016-12-09 09:06:03	na_th_an	and others too
2016-12-09 09:06:06	na_th_an	All current issues are caused by not having WorldCatIdentities and PatronAuthentication in PRT. If it is decided that these services are not part of the PRT project, then WorldCat.org is verified from the perspective of the PRT project, as all other parts of the service are verified.
2016-12-09 09:06:14	keveloper	i've heard about it but hasn't really experienced it
2016-12-09 09:06:15	na_th_an	^ that's what I said for worldcat.org
2016-12-09 09:06:38	keveloper	yep
2016-12-09 09:06:41	keveloper	woo worldcat is done
2016-12-09 09:06:47	keveloper	right?
2016-12-09 09:07:04	na_th_an	p sure
2016-12-09 09:07:10	keveloper	\o/
2016-12-09 09:07:12	keveloper	i agree
2016-12-09 09:07:14	na_th_an	once they say those things aren't part of PRT
2016-12-09 09:07:17	na_th_an	which I think they are going to
2016-12-09 09:07:28	na_th_an	I just want it to be on the blocker list until that's official
2016-12-09 09:07:34	na_th_an	for visibility and such
2016-12-09 09:07:41	keveloper	i thought that already happened
2016-12-09 09:07:46	na_th_an	idk
2016-12-09 09:07:55	na_th_an	I think Tom and Rich both think that
2016-12-09 09:07:58	na_th_an	but Bill isn't aware of that
2016-12-09 09:08:03	na_th_an	once they are all on the same page about it
2016-12-09 09:08:48	keveloper	catfriend really seems to latch on to things for no reason
2016-12-09 09:13:42	keveloper	catfriend is delusional
2016-12-09 09:14:16	na_th_an	indeed
2016-12-09 09:14:57	keveloper	doesnt understand exchange rates either
2016-12-09 09:15:25	na_th_an	canadians usually do kinda get fucked with the exchange rates
2016-12-09 09:15:53	na_th_an	even though their dollar is worth slightly less than that, goods are usally way more expensive than a raw USD->CAD conversion would give
2016-12-09 09:16:00	na_th_an	and there's also import taxes
2016-12-09 09:18:45	na_th_an	I have no idea what to do rn
2016-12-09 09:29:07	keveloper	codepen

2016-12-09 09:42:42	na_th_an	and wireframes
2016-12-09 09:42:44	na_th_an	and shit like that
2016-12-09 09:43:04	na_th_an	if mark were as good as a grade 18 with decades of experience should be this should take about 3 weeks

2016-12-09 13:14:47	na_th_an	bouncing or elasticity or something

2016-12-09 13:47:44	keveloper	imma remote soon
2016-12-09 13:47:47	keveloper	probs 2
2016-12-09 13:48:24	keveloper	are we using cdn for angular
2016-12-09 13:51:16	na_th_an	no we aren't storing that in dui code
2016-12-09 13:51:22	na_th_an	if it was a js file in DUI it would go to akamai
2016-12-09 13:51:31	na_th_an	but it's just a <script> tag in the user's browser
2016-12-09 13:51:38	na_th_an	so the user's browser goes and accesses github.io
2016-12-09 13:51:46	na_th_an	so if the library has a domain whitelist it won't work
2016-12-09 13:52:15	keveloper	...
2016-12-09 13:52:18	keveloper	so we are using a cdn
2016-12-09 13:52:21	na_th_an	no
2016-12-09 13:52:23	na_th_an	well kinda
2016-12-09 13:52:35	keveloper	if we have a script tag  to github.io
2016-12-09 13:52:41	keveloper	then yes
2016-12-09 13:53:00	na_th_an	idk if github.io is a cdn
2016-12-09 13:53:03	na_th_an	but even it is
2016-12-09 13:53:10	na_th_an	it's not akami which is what we should be using for cdn
2016-12-09 13:53:16	keveloper	yes
2016-12-09 13:53:19	keveloper	im saying external cdn
2016-12-09 13:53:22	keveloper	is what i meant
2016-12-09 13:53:32	na_th_an	we should not be relying on github.io staying up and not changing their resource paths
2016-12-09 13:53:33	keveloper	you know who would have known that we can't do that
2016-12-09 13:53:40	keveloper	because outbound firewalls?
2016-12-09 13:53:40	na_th_an	us?
2016-12-09 13:53:41	keveloper	US
2016-12-09 13:53:44	na_th_an	well
2016-12-09 13:53:45	keveloper	lol
2016-12-09 13:53:53	na_th_an	you know this is the library's firewall right
2016-12-09 13:53:53	keveloper	im going to guess this was charles
2016-12-09 13:53:57	na_th_an	it was
2016-12-09 13:53:59	na_th_an	but
2016-12-09 13:54:11	na_th_an	this isn't the prod hosts not being able to hit github.io
2016-12-09 13:54:19	keveloper	oh ya
2016-12-09 13:54:22	na_th_an	this is a browser in a library being blocked by the library's firewall
2016-12-09 13:54:26	keveloper	yeah
2016-12-09 13:54:27	keveloper	got it
2016-12-09 13:54:28	keveloper	still
2016-12-09 13:54:40	keveloper	dont use an external CDN
2016-12-09 13:54:49	na_th_an	yeah all of our resources should be in DUI 
2016-12-09 13:54:55	na_th_an	not sure how that slipped by 
2016-12-09 13:55:01	keveloper	in a code review
2016-12-09 13:55:02	keveloper	like
2016-12-09 13:55:14	keveloper	a script tag with a URL in it should be pretty easy to find
2016-12-09 13:55:24	na_th_an	ya
2016-12-09 13:56:46	keveloper	ugh idk what to make
2016-12-09 14:03:06	na_th_an	I think charles has learned over the last month exactly how fucked up DUI's front end is
2016-12-09 14:05:54	keveloper	remote?
2016-12-09 14:06:02	keveloper	yeah really
2016-12-09 14:06:17	keveloper	i wonder if he asked zach or someone about using external cdn
2016-12-09 14:06:23	keveloper	wanna remote though
2016-12-09 14:06:48	na_th_an	eh there's a lot of shit going on rn

2016-12-09 14:07:45	na_th_an	and it isn't feature complete yet
2016-12-09 14:07:50	keveloper	ah

2016-12-09 15:58:11	na_th_an	I mean I personally wouldn't be sitting remotely not working on anything while every member of the team is engaged in a prodfix and two people from customer support are up here
2016-12-09 15:58:26	na_th_an	but you can make your own decisions
2016-12-09 15:58:57	keveloper	k
2016-12-09 15:59:59	na_th_an	I don't know if there's anything you can do to be helping but I'd rather be around and not needed than needed and not around

2016-12-09 16:00:37	keveloper	me*
2016-12-09 16:00:48	keveloper	also i dont know anything about wcilr
2016-12-09 16:01:02	na_th_an	you know that WCILR talks to DR
2016-12-09 16:01:09	na_th_an	and nobody else did
2016-12-09 16:01:18	na_th_an	and Brian just verified that the problem is with DR
2016-12-09 16:01:29	na_th_an	because I informed him that WCILR didn't work in any environment until we got DR working
2016-12-09 16:04:14	na_th_an	rashmi is asking mark if he can figure out all the changes that were made to DR since the last release
2016-12-09 16:06:41	keveloper	and
2016-12-09 16:07:08	na_th_an	I'm curious if he ca

2016-12-09 16:07:43	na_th_an	idk there was some button in the ILR pages that wasn't appearing
2016-12-09 16:07:45	keveloper	idk but he's off to a bad start scrollin gthrough jira

2016-12-09 16:08:26	na_th_an	but ya there was some fulfillment button in the ilr pages that wasn't coming back
2016-12-09 16:09:17	keveloper	Added index page entry to get to DUI Fulfillment call
2016-12-09 16:09:19	keveloper	on dec 01
2016-12-09 16:10:02	keveloper	more fullfilment stuff on 30 nov
2016-12-09 16:10:12	keveloper	ying did a bunch of fulfilment changes
2016-12-09 16:10:41	na_th_an	yeah
2016-12-09 16:10:44	na_th_an	idk what he's doing
2016-12-09 16:11:01	na_th_an	"can you see if we made any changes that might affect this"
2016-12-09 16:11:05	na_th_an	ten minutes later
2016-12-09 16:11:09	na_th_an	"it's gonna take as long as it takes"
2016-12-09 16:11:11	keveloper	there's like 14 fulfilment related commits
2016-12-09 16:11:19	keveloper	in the last 3 weeks
2016-12-09 16:11:22	keveloper	so probably one of those
2016-12-09 16:11:37	na_th_an	idk man better be sure before we roll back DR
2016-12-09 16:11:43	na_th_an	even though we tested a rollback in NIT and it fixed the issue
2016-12-09 16:11:57	keveloper	why are we waiting to roll back then
2016-12-09 16:12:05	na_th_an	idk rashmi was asking mark to be sure or something
2016-12-09 16:12:11	keveloper	that the issue is DR?
2016-12-09 16:12:16	na_th_an	I think she was basically giving mark an opportunity for empowerment
2016-12-09 16:12:22	na_th_an	to say "yes this is the problem"
2016-12-09 16:12:29	keveloper	an opportunity to waste time probably
2016-12-09 16:12:32	na_th_an	yes
2016-12-09 16:12:39	na_th_an	an opportunity to say "you failed at this" 
2016-12-09 16:12:56	na_th_an	hey guys have you ever heard of 'git log'
2016-12-09 16:12:59	na_th_an	maybe even 'git log -p'
2016-12-09 16:13:14	na_th_an	also if you have a decent terminal and up to date software you can have color git log output
2016-12-09 16:13:17	keveloper	is this an openurl thing
2016-12-09 16:13:22	keveloper	openurl fullfilment thing
2016-12-09 16:13:23	na_th_an	but that's really complicated
2016-12-09 16:13:26	na_th_an	uhhhh maybe
2016-12-09 16:13:28	na_th_an	idk
2016-12-09 16:13:29	keveloper	http://git.ent.oclc.org/projects/DISC/repos/deliveryresolver/commits/ef215ccdfec878340d2af9da60678d091c6fa47b
2016-12-09 16:13:51	na_th_an	yeah I think that's likely what caused the issue
2016-12-09 16:14:00	keveloper	that exact commit?
2016-12-09 16:14:02	na_th_an	probably
2016-12-09 16:14:05	keveloper	why
2016-12-09 16:14:05	na_th_an	idk tho
2016-12-09 16:14:17	na_th_an	idk this has something to do with openurls, fulfillment, and delivery resolver
2016-12-09 16:14:19	na_th_an	as I understand it
2016-12-09 16:14:25	na_th_an	so... I'd guess it was this commit
2016-12-09 16:14:30	na_th_an	I'd put $10 on that
2016-12-09 16:15:12	keveloper	i just heard product say something about locale
2016-12-09 16:15:39	keveloper	http://git.ent.oclc.org/projects/DISC/repos/deliveryresolver/commits/ef215ccdfec878340d2af9da60678d091c6fa47b#delivery-resolver-client/src/main/java/org/oclc/nutmeg/Fulfillment/FulfillmentLinkBuilderTemplate.java

2016-12-09 16:16:52	na_th_an	who the fuck reviewed this
2016-12-09 16:16:54	keveloper	If there are no links present from the KB AND the lib is using an OURL request button (such as ILLiad), the request button should appear on the link resolver, if it is configured to appear.
2016-12-09 16:18:10	na_th_an	this is embarassing

2016-12-09 16:18:48	na_th_an	"I hope it didn't get into the release" not sure why she said that

2016-12-13 14:05:15	na_th_an	I wonder what Harika is doing

2016-12-13 14:09:03	na_th_an	he's like "What did you do to make someone mad to get you this task"
2016-12-13 14:09:13	na_th_an	and I'm just thinking "you have no idea"

2016-12-13 16:48:52	keveloper	yeah first of all that

2016-12-13 16:51:24	na_th_an	 if you're selling to a friend, your case isn't good, and you are only giving a 1TB HDD then it's not that bad
2016-12-13 16:51:31	na_th_an	also depending on how good the PSU is
2016-12-13 16:51:32	keveloper	he has an ssd
2016-12-13 16:51:44	na_th_an	any idea on the size/what kind?

2016-12-13 16:52:16	na_th_an	you can price his CPU, MB, and graphics card at like $300 minimum
2016-12-13 16:52:56	na_th_an	it kinda depends on how much you like the guy tho
2016-12-13 16:53:17	keveloper	eh $400 sounds right
2016-12-13 16:54:17	keveloper	when you leavin
2016-12-13 16:54:20	na_th_an	if it's an average SSD, case and PSU then that's not too bad

2016-12-14 14:47:07	na_th_an	when they do that, will our current DR be broken?
2016-12-14 14:47:15	na_th_an	and then only snowflake DR will work?
2016-12-14 14:47:46	na_th_an	so we need to have that DR tested and merged into master and ready to install into production, ya?

2016-12-15 09:35:46	na_th_an	yesterday in grooming they were like "we don't have time to get rid of the old way we do citations, the political climate right now is to get things done fater"
2016-12-15 09:35:48	na_th_an	faster*
2016-12-15 09:35:57	na_th_an	and angela was like "no, you have to get rid of old shit"
2016-12-15 09:36:09	na_th_an	it was very depressing
2016-12-15 09:36:15	keveloper	and you were like
2016-12-15 09:36:19	keveloper	"angela, you will learn"
2016-12-15 09:36:21	na_th_an	bryan was like "that's always what the political climate is"

2016-12-15 09:36:43	na_th_an	and then zach and bryan came back and talked about how this always happens
2016-12-15 09:36:49	na_th_an	and how everything is shit
2016-12-15 09:37:00	na_th_an	mela was like "I thought it'd be nice to have a help link here"
2016-12-15 09:37:06	na_th_an	and then we spent 20 minutes talking about how we could do that
2016-12-15 09:37:12	na_th_an	when it was COMPLETELY out of scope
2016-12-15 09:37:27	na_th_an	until finally we were like "oh I guess it'd cost a lot of money to translate so we'll have to get budget approval first"
2016-12-15 09:37:38	na_th_an	"I'll bring this up to cathy"
2016-12-15 09:37:58	na_th_an	it was all just very depressing
2016-12-15 09:39:17	na_th_an	also I don't really know anything but there's some questionable shit that happened to get rashmi hired too

2016-12-15 09:39:55	na_th_an	i guess cathy was trying to make a deal to get liz into jay's position but andy didn't want to because she wasn't qualified? idk why cathy wanted liz
2016-12-15 09:40:15	na_th_an	but apparently as a part of hiring rashmi, liz was supposed to get jay's spot or something?
2016-12-15 09:40:17	keveloper	yeah
2016-12-15 09:40:26	keveloper	i've heard bridget talk about that
2016-12-15 09:40:31	na_th_an	zach was like "I know I didn't vote for her"
2016-12-15 09:40:54	na_th_an	"why do you want to leave" "backroom deals that gave me a shitty manager"
2016-12-15 09:40:59	na_th_an	as liz gives me my exit interview

2016-12-15 15:10:46	keveloper	i think brushed aluminum looks way better
2016-12-15 15:10:55	keveloper	than that like reflective circle thing
2016-12-15 15:11:01	na_th_an	you can always get a shell
2016-12-15 15:11:06	keveloper	tru
2016-12-15 15:11:16	keveloper	i dont need a new laptop lol what am i oin
2016-12-15 15:11:20	keveloper	doin*
2016-12-15 15:11:27	na_th_an	you've mentioned it before :)
2016-12-15 15:11:31	keveloper	lol
2016-12-15 15:11:37	keveloper	then i bought a $1600 desktop
2016-12-15 15:11:52	na_th_an	lol rashmi being like "I have a mac" when I was talking about needing a good gaming computer
2016-12-15 15:11:54	keveloper	$1920 now after that monitor
2016-12-15 15:11:56	keveloper	lolol
2016-12-15 15:12:00	keveloper	rip
2016-12-15 15:13:39	keveloper	damn i would love to get a new laptop and put arch and a pretty looking kde theme
2016-12-15 15:13:41	keveloper	on it
2016-12-15 15:13:52	keveloper	was it hard to do on the zenbook
2016-12-15 15:13:55	na_th_an	no
2016-12-15 15:13:58	keveloper	any annoying things to do
2016-12-15 15:14:01	keveloper	or did it just work
2016-12-15 15:15:30	na_th_an	it pretty much just worked
2016-12-15 15:15:46	na_th_an	there's a tool in windows to shrink the partition it uses
2016-12-15 15:15:47	keveloper	coo
2016-12-15 15:15:54	na_th_an	it's actually pretty cool
2016-12-15 15:16:11	na_th_an	I shrunk the windows partition down to like 1/2 the drive (which was the most I could shrink it by)
2016-12-15 15:16:23	na_th_an	then I just installed onto the empty partition
2016-12-15 15:16:35	na_th_an	the only hard part was the UHD screen 
2016-12-15 15:16:42	keveloper	aw
2016-12-15 15:16:45	keveloper	i dont want any hard parts
2016-12-15 15:16:59	na_th_an	the terminal still uses 8 point fonts (I think) so when you start the arch install the text is like, super super tiny
2016-12-15 15:17:10	na_th_an	you can just set a font tho
2016-12-15 15:17:12	na_th_an	it's not 'hard'
2016-12-15 15:17:15	na_th_an	just an extra step
2016-12-15 15:17:15	keveloper	wait
2016-12-15 15:17:27	keveloper	so the hard part is font being too small
2016-12-15 15:17:32	na_th_an	there's a little extra config for UHD
2016-12-15 15:17:34	na_th_an	ya
2016-12-15 15:17:39	keveloper	i think i can deal
2016-12-15 15:17:45	na_th_an	dual booting is p easy tho
2016-12-15 15:17:47	keveloper	can i just get close to the screen
2016-12-15 15:17:56	keveloper	i'll have to dual boot for RL lol
2016-12-15 15:17:56	na_th_an	grup can automatically detect and configure dual booting
2016-12-15 15:18:08	keveloper	would emily be mad if i took my laptop on the plain to play RL lol

2016-12-19 13:52:16	na_th_an	I'm finding where they come from
2016-12-19 13:52:20	keveloper	i do
2016-12-19 13:52:22	keveloper	i know
2016-12-19 13:52:26	keveloper	the ini file
2016-12-19 13:52:27	na_th_an	in the script?
2016-12-19 13:52:32	na_th_an	I know that
2016-12-19 13:52:34	keveloper	Cayenne.ini
2016-12-19 13:52:35	na_th_an	I'm looking through the script
2016-12-19 13:52:37	na_th_an	I know
2016-12-19 13:52:41	na_th_an	and this is the script that reads that
2016-12-19 13:52:41	keveloper	Type=Prod is thre
2016-12-19 13:52:49	keveloper	so it should not do that
2016-12-19 13:52:56	na_th_an	this is a prod type install tho
2016-12-19 13:53:03	keveloper	correct
2016-12-19 13:53:06	na_th_an	it'd probably just die on something else
2016-12-19 13:53:15	na_th_an	oh you're not saying we should change that
2016-12-19 13:53:20	keveloper	no
2016-12-19 13:53:31	keveloper	wait
2016-12-19 13:53:36	keveloper	ok
2016-12-19 13:53:41	keveloper	i think we should add start and stop
2016-12-19 13:53:55	na_th_an	no other env hsa that
2016-12-19 13:53:56	keveloper	wait but prod doesnt have those

2016-12-19 13:55:23	na_th_an	I'm skeptical that a prod install will work rn
2016-12-19 13:55:38	na_th_an	based on the properties in that ini file and this script's contents
2016-12-19 13:56:24	na_th_an	unless they provide a command line parameter to set the iSoftHosts to 'NA'
2016-12-19 14:11:21	keveloper	uh

2016-12-19 15:18:55	na_th_an	like, they never had any opportunities or whatever
2016-12-19 15:18:59	na_th_an	but your fam isn't poor
2016-12-19 15:19:08	na_th_an	I would have thought you'd have gone somewhere out of country 
2016-12-19 15:19:12	na_th_an	at least to canada or some shit
2016-12-19 15:19:20	keveloper	my parents have been paying high taxes in hilliard

2016-12-19 15:19:44	keveloper	to SC or FL
2016-12-19 15:19:50	keveloper	4 or 5 days
2016-12-19 15:19:59	keveloper	mom is a professor/advisor

2016-12-19 15:20:26	na_th_an	it's not THAT much more money to go to like, niagra falls or mexico over a FL/SC vacation
2016-12-19 15:20:28	keveloper	but yeah i dont think they had *that*much money
2016-12-19 15:20:34	keveloper	i guess so yeah
2016-12-19 15:20:39	keveloper	i guess they just had other priorities
2016-12-19 15:20:46	na_th_an	I'm not picturing you as like rich or anything
2016-12-19 15:20:50	keveloper	like saving or investing in kids' colelge
2016-12-19 15:21:04	keveloper	they've invested a lot in their house and property

2016-12-19 15:21:13	na_th_an	ya
2016-12-19 15:21:21	keveloper	i think they are just serious about saving
2016-12-19 15:21:24	keveloper	and not touching it
2016-12-19 15:21:30	na_th_an	ya I mean that's good
2016-12-19 15:21:43	na_th_an	I would have just guessed that you'd at least have gone to canada or some shit
2016-12-19 15:21:58	keveloper	caleb and katie tried to work out how much money they make and what it goes to and make a little budget and what they found was that they probably have way more money than they make it out to be
2016-12-19 15:22:04	keveloper	no

2016-12-19 15:23:06	na_th_an	one time after christmas my mom was talking to me and was like "if you ever make over $100k a year then you should be spending more than $1k on your wife's christmas present"

2016-12-19 15:25:15	na_th_an	I was making significantly more as an intern here than my mom was at her job
2016-12-19 15:25:26	na_th_an	which is sad
2016-12-19 15:25:41	keveloper	:/
2016-12-19 15:26:02	keveloper	we're p lucky that we love programming/software
2016-12-19 15:26:04	keveloper	web dev
2016-12-19 15:26:06	na_th_an	ya
2016-12-19 15:26:12	keveloper	it's a good thing to like
2016-12-19 15:26:23	keveloper	switching majors to CS was the best decision I will ever make in my life
2016-12-19 15:26:24	keveloper	lol
2016-12-19 15:26:25	keveloper	maybe
2016-12-19 15:26:27	na_th_an	haley's like "you worked hard you deserve what you have"
2016-12-19 15:26:34	keveloper	so has she right lol
2016-12-19 15:26:40	na_th_an	and I'm like "I'm also really really lucky that what I'm passionate about also happens to be what's in demand"
2016-12-19 15:26:44	keveloper	yeah
2016-12-19 15:26:47	keveloper	that * 100
2016-12-19 15:26:52	na_th_an	I started programming because it was fun
2016-12-19 15:26:55	keveloper	yeah same
2016-12-19 15:27:16	keveloper	did you know: the only reason i was ever a minor in cs at school was because my dad pretty much made me
2016-12-19 15:27:21	keveloper	they were like "you ened a minor"
2016-12-19 15:27:26	keveloper	and i was like "i guess cs idc"
2016-12-19 15:27:29	keveloper	then i took my first class
2016-12-19 15:27:35	keveloper	and was like "this is amazing"
2016-12-19 15:27:41	keveloper	i did some java and front end html/css stuff before that
2016-12-19 15:27:46	keveloper	but i never really like got into it
2016-12-19 15:27:49	keveloper	then i learned python
2016-12-19 15:27:59	keveloper	and our prof picked some good projects to interested newbs
2016-12-19 15:28:08	keveloper	then after a nother class i switched \o/
2016-12-19 15:28:08	na_th_an	that's interesting
2016-12-19 15:28:14	keveloper	because music tech was easy
2016-12-19 15:28:18	keveloper	and CS was hard and interesting
2016-12-19 15:28:22	na_th_an	because if you were at OSU you would have had the interest in CS beaten right out of you
2016-12-19 15:28:29	keveloper	thats dumb
2016-12-19 15:28:36	keveloper	yeah our CS 160 intro to CS class is all python
2016-12-19 15:28:45	keveloper	you make like little games with the graphics module in python
2016-12-19 15:28:50	keveloper	like black jack
2016-12-19 15:28:55	na_th_an	our software I class is all java and it's super dumb
2016-12-19 15:28:56	keveloper	he gives you some card gifs
2016-12-19 15:29:06	keveloper	and you use a really easy python graphics thing to draw everything
2016-12-19 15:29:14	keveloper	and it basically like got me hooked
2016-12-19 15:29:18	keveloper	because i was making something real
2016-12-19 15:29:21	na_th_an	they make you do every method with an expects: and requires: clause in the javadoc, then use math notation to describe what the function does
2016-12-19 15:29:26	keveloper	it wasnt just like random stupid shit
2016-12-19 15:29:34	keveloper	well yeah we had to do pre and post conditions
2016-12-19 15:29:39	keveloper	well commented
2016-12-19 15:29:43	keveloper	doc for every method
2016-12-19 15:29:51	keveloper	pre and post conditions for every param i think
2016-12-19 15:29:53	na_th_an	ours was all about "provably correct programs" and "design by contract"
2016-12-19 15:30:16	keveloper	our intro is literally to interest people or show people they dont like it
2016-12-19 15:30:18	keveloper	it was great
2016-12-19 15:30:28	keveloper	161 is where you get into harder data structures and stuff
2016-12-19 15:30:32	na_th_an	"OSU doesn't have weedout classes" is bullshit
2016-12-19 15:30:34	keveloper	thats like the weed out class
2016-12-19 15:30:37	na_th_an	they don't have weedout classes by design
2016-12-19 15:30:41	na_th_an	but they do in practice
2016-12-19 15:30:49	keveloper	data structure and algorithms I and II are the weed out classes where you start doing like *real* CS
2016-12-19 15:30:59	keveloper	well i mean they arent by design
2016-12-19 15:31:05	na_th_an	mark does this thing as soon as he wakes up where he mumbles to himself like he's been working on a hard problem
2016-12-19 15:31:19	keveloper	thats just when it gets hard and more abstract (less rewarding for disinterested people) so people quit
2016-12-19 15:31:23	keveloper	or fail lol
2016-12-19 15:31:48	na_th_an	a LOT of people quit in software I and II
2016-12-19 15:31:57	keveloper	yeah
2016-12-19 15:32:06	na_th_an	because it's boring and explained poorly
2016-12-19 15:32:16	na_th_an	and you come out of it with no applicable skills 
2016-12-19 15:32:21	keveloper	there are always a bunch of sections of 160 and 161 then by the time 361 rolls around theres like a third of the people
2016-12-19 15:32:24	na_th_an	they teach you with OSU standard library
2016-12-19 15:32:27	keveloper	then those third are the grads in 3 years
2016-12-19 15:32:28	na_th_an	you don't use java libraries at all
2016-12-19 15:32:30	na_th_an	no List or Map
2016-12-19 15:32:32	keveloper	yeah ive heard
2016-12-19 15:32:34	keveloper	stupid shit
2016-12-19 15:32:35	na_th_an	it's OSU implementations of it
2016-12-19 15:32:56	na_th_an	so you can come out of there with no way at all to write software and share it with a friend
2016-12-19 15:33:05	na_th_an	thanks to the magic of java and osu libraries
2016-12-19 15:34:16	na_th_an	"don't use alert() for debugging, it blocks the code and can cause different behavior. use console.log()"
2016-12-19 15:34:28	na_th_an	"console.log() is synchronous. Use an async logging module."
2016-12-19 15:34:31	na_th_an	#javascript
2016-12-19 15:35:49	na_th_an	omg he's asleep again
2016-12-19 15:38:41	keveloper	you didnt come out of cap with a lot of knowledge on how to make a project and collab with people or share
2016-12-19 15:38:50	keveloper	i guess you learned git/github
2016-12-19 15:38:55	na_th_an	eh... kinda
2016-12-19 15:38:59	keveloper	i mean really its up to the student
2016-12-19 15:39:03	keveloper	capital
2016-12-19 15:39:07	na_th_an	they used svn in software i/ii
2016-12-19 15:39:09	keveloper	what do you mean eh kinda
2016-12-19 15:39:16	keveloper	i meant
2016-12-19 15:39:24	na_th_an	we used git in my web project class but it was super super basic
2016-12-19 15:39:25	keveloper	one doesnt come out of capital university with ....
2016-12-19 15:39:30	na_th_an	you didn't actually learn it
2016-12-19 15:39:35	keveloper	yeah
2016-12-19 15:39:37	keveloper	thats kinda how git was
2016-12-19 15:39:40	keveloper	at capital
2016-12-19 15:39:51	keveloper	the only reason i know it well is myself
2016-12-19 15:39:58	na_th_an	IF you took one class (there are 3 or 4 options) you learn the very very basics
2016-12-19 15:40:00	keveloper	its really the students job to become exceptional if they want to
2016-12-19 15:40:02	na_th_an	and even then it's optional
2016-12-19 15:40:04	keveloper	yeah
2016-12-19 15:40:43	na_th_an	you work in groups enough at OSU to put it on your resume but not enough to get any useful experience
2016-12-19 15:40:58	keveloper	i wanna take a vacation hour and just leave
2016-12-19 15:41:00	keveloper	at 4
2016-12-19 15:41:03	na_th_an	like the web dev project course, you only have 3 or 4 weeks out of the semester
2016-12-19 15:41:11	na_th_an	to work on the actual project
2016-12-19 15:41:24	na_th_an	the rest is background shit like "Here are the parts of the URL"
2016-12-19 15:41:27	keveloper	i wanna get look running
2016-12-19 15:41:33	keveloper	that was the project i asked if you wanted to work on
2016-12-19 15:41:35	keveloper	and you were like
2016-12-19 15:41:36	keveloper	lol
2016-12-19 15:41:40	na_th_an	look?
2016-12-19 15:41:51	keveloper	it was my image sharing app i wrote
2016-12-19 15:42:06	keveloper	https://github.com/Look-Web/Look
2016-12-19 15:42:46	na_th_an	I wonder if Eric ever learned any rust
2016-12-19 15:42:53	na_th_an	really wanna know if he graduated
2016-12-19 15:43:09	na_th_an	holy shit I know Trey McDeane
2016-12-19 15:43:12	keveloper	i need to remake my personal site
2016-12-19 15:43:14	keveloper	no you do not
2016-12-19 15:43:16	keveloper	no way
2016-12-19 15:43:17	na_th_an	true
2016-12-19 15:43:19	na_th_an	I am lying
2016-12-19 15:43:20	keveloper	lol
2016-12-19 15:43:25	keveloper	i was like he's a little piece of shit
2016-12-19 15:43:29	na_th_an	lolololol
2016-12-19 15:43:34	keveloper	he was supposed to finish the front end and fell asleep
2016-12-19 15:43:37	na_th_an	I was gonna be like "I met him in boyscouts"
2016-12-19 15:43:39	keveloper	at 11:30pm
2016-12-19 15:43:47	keveloper	i stayed up till 5am finishing the front end
2016-12-19 15:43:54	keveloper	i did 95% of the project
2016-12-19 15:44:14	keveloper	yeah i really need to rewrite my portfolio this i abd
2016-12-19 15:45:16	na_th_an	i don't want to email marcus and be like "are you gonna do this" because he should be able to read my whole email
2016-12-19 15:45:24	na_th_an	and I don't wanna be like "you're too slow"
2016-12-19 15:45:29	na_th_an	but idk if he read my whole email
2016-12-19 15:45:31	keveloper	lol
2016-12-19 15:45:35	keveloper	idk just email him
2016-12-19 15:46:11	keveloper	if tom had to say "the prt project is delayed because nathan kessler wanted to be polite to middleware about their slow work rate" to jeff jacobs he'd be like
2016-12-19 15:46:16	keveloper	fired
2016-12-19 15:46:25	na_th_an	well prt project is already delayed
2016-12-19 15:46:41	na_th_an	and it'd be "prt project is delayed because nathan kessler assumed that middleware read his whole 4 sentence email"
2016-12-19 15:47:40	keveloper	dude
2016-12-19 15:47:49	keveloper	i had this fucking boost addicted asshole teammate yesterday
2016-12-19 15:48:04	na_th_an	I was thinking "boost mobile"
2016-12-19 15:48:11	na_th_an	and it took me a sec to realize you were talking about RL
2016-12-19 15:48:52	keveloper	"defending" on a kickoff, other teammate loses the kickoff (whatever it happens), i dont rush to hit it because from my angle i would probably center it for the other team and i know the guy said "defending" so he should be ready to clear/shoot
2016-12-19 15:49:00	keveloper	he's off getting boost and it rolls in
2016-12-19 15:49:06	na_th_an	I've truly learned in this project that only one action item can be included in an email chain at a time
2016-12-19 15:49:08	keveloper	then gets mad at the guy for missing the kick off
2016-12-19 15:49:28	na_th_an	lol
2016-12-19 15:49:40	na_th_an	going for boost at kickoff is a bit of a risk ya
2016-12-19 15:49:40	keveloper	then was in goal, other team was slowly attacking, he left to get boost, they scored
2016-12-19 15:49:47	na_th_an	can't get amad at the guy for missing kickoff when you do that tho
2016-12-19 15:50:01	keveloper	i wasnt mad at the guy for missing kick off lol
2016-12-19 15:50:08	keveloper	ohh you meant the boost guy
2016-12-19 15:50:12	keveloper	yeah
2016-12-19 15:50:25	keveloper	imo in standard on a kick off there should always be someone in goal
2016-12-19 15:50:28	keveloper	its just a stupid goal to let in
2016-12-19 15:50:33	keveloper	just fucking sit there for 4 seconds
2016-12-19 15:50:40	keveloper	defense > offense
2016-12-19 15:50:50	keveloper	sorry if it bores you to sit in one spot for 4 seconds
2016-12-19 15:50:54	na_th_an	ya if you have 3 ppl then 1 should be in goal
2016-12-19 15:50:59	na_th_an	it's diff for doubles
2016-12-19 15:51:02	keveloper	doubles i understand getting boost
2016-12-19 15:51:11	keveloper	but the guy going for kickoff cannot lose
2016-12-19 15:51:30	keveloper	if you can quickly get boost as fast as possible and return its not that big of a deal
2016-12-19 15:51:34	keveloper	i still dont get boost in doubles tho
2016-12-19 15:51:37	keveloper	i just sit in the goal
2016-12-19 15:51:59	keveloper	then as soon as i know they dont have an attack i get the boost
2016-12-19 15:52:07	keveloper	i've saved a lot of goals that way
2016-12-19 15:52:21	keveloper	https://rocketleaguestats.com/profile/steam/76561198085132939
2016-12-19 15:52:32	keveloper	just look at my saves in the pie chart bro
2016-12-19 15:52:33	keveloper	lol
2016-12-19 15:53:37	keveloper	i have 219 hours in RL now what do you have
2016-12-19 15:53:42	na_th_an	idk

2016-12-19 15:54:40	keveloper	no thats you
2016-12-19 15:54:42	na_th_an	ya

2016-12-19 15:56:17	na_th_an	if you're going to ask me what the syntax is for adding a flag then just give me your keyboard
2016-12-19 15:56:35	keveloper	jfc
2016-12-19 15:56:39	keveloper	shoudlve said on the end
2016-12-19 15:56:41	keveloper	always safest imo
2016-12-19 15:57:27	keveloper	omg this guy in css uses js to load a background image
2016-12-19 15:57:32	keveloper	when confronted about it he said
2016-12-19 15:57:36	keveloper	"i use js for everything"
2016-12-19 15:57:53	na_th_an	apparently the stage didn't work but marcus said it did? or maybe he just didn't run it but said he did
2016-12-19 15:57:56	keveloper	holy shit its so slow
2016-12-19 15:57:57	na_th_an	(for firstsearch)

2016-12-19 16:01:34	keveloper	yeah it sucks
2016-12-19 16:01:37	na_th_an	the dev has no direction
2016-12-19 16:01:43	na_th_an	no vision for what the game is going to be
2016-12-19 16:01:50	na_th_an	it's just a bunch of "oh this might be cool"
2016-12-19 16:02:01	na_th_an	so there's some fun things but the player base is way too fractured
2016-12-19 16:02:11	na_th_an	nobody ever really plays it
2016-12-19 16:02:24	keveloper	i wanna leavve

2016-12-19 16:02:56	na_th_an	apparently
2016-12-19 16:03:00	keveloper	isn't there a verbnose name
2016-12-19 16:03:02	keveloper	he should try that
2016-12-19 16:03:07	keveloper	--suppress
2016-12-19 16:03:07	na_th_an	no there isn't
2016-12-19 16:03:08	keveloper	or something
2016-12-19 16:03:13	keveloper	are you sure i thought i saw that
2016-12-19 16:03:44	na_th_an	no they did not program these perl scripts to be that smart
2016-12-19 16:03:59	na_th_an	I don't think it picked up the supress option
2016-12-19 16:04:30	keveloper	i think we should add a start and stop
2016-12-19 16:04:32	keveloper	oh
2016-12-19 16:04:40	keveloper	ok
2016-12-19 16:04:51	keveloper	he added it to the end
2016-12-19 16:05:07	keveloper	he should add it to the beginning
2016-12-19 16:05:11	na_th_an	idk the firstsearch script didn't always pick up options 
2016-12-19 16:05:39	keveloper	i told him to do it in the beginning
2016-12-19 16:05:40	keveloper	idfk
2016-12-19 16:05:41	keveloper	why not
2016-12-19 16:05:50	na_th_an	that might work
2016-12-19 16:05:57	na_th_an	it's less stupid than you think
2016-12-19 16:06:05	keveloper	lol i didnt think it was that stupid
2016-12-19 16:06:40	keveloper	i assume it stops parsing the command at some point when you put actual text is has to read so
2016-12-19 16:06:53	na_th_an	no it's smarter than that
2016-12-19 16:07:02	na_th_an	it has to take a version and environment param
2016-12-19 16:07:06	na_th_an	both with text values
2016-12-19 16:07:19	na_th_an	so idk why it doesn't work but 
2016-12-19 16:07:38	keveloper	i assumed it would ignore everything after prt-paws
2016-12-19 16:08:12	keveloper	https://gfycat.com/EminentColossalKid
2016-12-19 16:08:15	keveloper	dude fucking people

2016-12-20 10:44:18	keveloper	its another cayenne thing that uses sybase

2017-01-03 10:20:54	keveloper	oh
2017-01-03 10:26:53	keveloper	it does the normal POST to acs
2017-01-03 10:26:54	keveloper	then a get?
2017-01-03 10:28:36	keveloper	Oh I think its because its an http post first
2017-01-03 10:28:47	keveloper	then the browser tries to convert to https or something when it gets the response
2017-01-03 10:28:50	keveloper	uhhh
2017-01-03 10:30:25	na_th_an	yes
2017-01-03 10:30:33	na_th_an	it was POSTing to HTTP
2017-01-03 10:30:36	keveloper	why is it doing http instead of https
2017-01-03 10:30:37	na_th_an	getting a redirect to HTTPS
2017-01-03 10:30:42	na_th_an	before it was getting a 301 response
2017-01-03 10:30:43	keveloper	its supposed to be posting
2017-01-03 10:30:47	keveloper	no
2017-01-03 10:30:47	na_th_an	which was converting it to a GET
2017-01-03 10:30:55	na_th_an	the other farms used a 302
2017-01-03 10:30:55	keveloper	im looking at it in CI
2017-01-03 10:31:02	na_th_an	so we asked them to change it to a 302

2017-01-03 13:32:34	keveloper	so why are load testing this
2017-01-03 13:32:43	keveloper	"Load test discovery"
2017-01-03 13:32:45	keveloper	the whole app?
2017-01-03 13:32:49	keveloper	because we changed permalinks?

2017-01-03 13:33:01	na_th_an	yeah we have load testing in the citations shit too
2017-01-03 13:33:05	na_th_an	like.... okay
2017-01-03 13:33:08	na_th_an	I guess
2017-01-03 13:33:09	keveloper	I don't think this is a use ccase for load testing...
2017-01-03 13:33:25	keveloper	like we will get more traffic when we get more users
2017-01-03 13:33:28	keveloper	what are we testing
2017-01-03 13:33:49	keveloper	like if DUI can't handle a big load that has nothing to do with and will not be fixed by permalink or citations
2017-01-03 13:33:52	na_th_an	I don't think anyone could answer that
2017-01-03 13:34:12	keveloper	and permalink or citations did not make it worse
2017-01-03 13:34:23	keveloper	i'm assuming this was rashmi
2017-01-03 13:34:44	keveloper	do we even have a load testing tool
2017-01-03 13:35:31	na_th_an	oh I just found a 3rd perl script that can change fsdatamanager.ini

2017-01-04 10:00:58	keveloper	i think that would be worth while
2017-01-04 10:00:58	na_th_an	I tried to figure that out and never got an answer on why we had to do a prodfix build
2017-01-04 10:01:01	na_th_an	I do too
2017-01-04 10:01:03	keveloper	considering it wont be going anywhere for 10 years
2017-01-04 10:01:11	na_th_an	it would have paid off already 
2017-01-04 10:01:11	keveloper	10+

2017-01-04 10:04:24	na_th_an	I think one of the issues is that it uses shit from /sq

2017-01-04 10:04:34	keveloper	oracle has something called Juniper Networks

2017-01-04 11:07:27	na_th_an	the way he's talking about shit is so bad
2017-01-04 11:07:35	na_th_an	he's not approaching this from "how do I design a service"
2017-01-04 11:07:35	keveloper	-_-
2017-01-04 11:07:40	na_th_an	he's not thinking "how do I make this work"
2017-01-04 11:07:44	na_th_an	he's thinking "what does rashmi want'
2017-01-04 11:07:49	na_th_an	"how do I make rashmi happy"
2017-01-04 11:07:58	na_th_an	instead of asking, "do these design documents make sense" or doing anything
2017-01-04 11:08:00	na_th_an	it's just like 
2017-01-04 11:08:03	na_th_an	whatever rashmi wants

2017-01-04 11:08:16	na_th_an	"she wants a design document for it all"
2017-01-04 11:08:24	na_th_an	"like, when you do the ui, you need a design document"
2017-01-04 11:10:38	na_th_an	it took him 10 minutes to project
2017-01-04 11:10:41	na_th_an	still isn't on wifi
2017-01-04 11:11:08	na_th_an	the design documents he's produced don't follow the application architecture that's been standard for over a year
2017-01-04 11:11:23	na_th_an	he's twice said he'd schedule a meeting then "Never got around to it"
2017-01-04 11:13:27	na_th_an	also ed can stop saying "we don't own the scripts"

2017-01-04 13:57:43	na_th_an	this literally doesn't make sense
2017-01-04 13:57:56	keveloper	what is that json for
2017-01-04 13:58:00	na_th_an	why the fuck would you have multiple items per request
2017-01-04 13:58:03	keveloper	the response?
2017-01-04 13:58:04	na_th_an	that makes 0 sense at all
2017-01-04 13:58:05	na_th_an	idk
2017-01-04 13:58:15	keveloper	why is it returning anything more than the citation
2017-01-04 13:58:16	na_th_an	we said we were not going to send the oclc number to the citation service
2017-01-04 13:58:18	na_th_an	but here it says we are
2017-01-04 13:58:23	na_th_an	so I just have no idea what I'm looking at
2017-01-04 13:58:27	keveloper	thats what its returning
2017-01-04 13:58:34	keveloper	citation thing returns that
2017-01-04 13:58:39	keveloper	if it says "content from easybib"
2017-01-04 13:58:42	keveloper	gtg
2017-01-04 14:08:46	na_th_an	I'm using words here like "HTTP header" and "response body"
2017-01-04 14:55:41	na_th_an	almost every piece of design that mark came up with violates the application architecture
2017-01-04 15:01:30	keveloper	lol
2017-01-04 15:02:07	na_th_an	this design is so awful
2017-01-04 15:02:10	keveloper	we had 2-3 minute discussion in that meeting about if we should use 301 or 302 for WCL->WCD redirects lol
2017-01-04 15:02:22	keveloper	hows mark lol
2017-01-04 15:02:43	keveloper	that was a very good meeting

2017-01-04 15:05:50	na_th_an	"I think it'd be helpful to have either you or bryan in a meeting with me and mark to walk through our design and make sure it's following the recommended architecture, because I don't think mark really gets it"
2017-01-04 15:06:05	na_th_an	having a lead who knows nothing is not working out so far
2017-01-04 15:10:20	keveloper	Apricot

2017-01-04 15:28:23	na_th_an	rashmi sent an email to the network team asking for clarification on how proxies work because mark doesn't understand network
2017-01-04 15:28:27	na_th_an	omg I forgot to tell you
2017-01-04 15:28:28	na_th_an	he was like
2017-01-04 15:28:49	keveloper	wait what
2017-01-04 15:28:54	keveloper	how proxies work
2017-01-04 15:28:57	keveloper	like
2017-01-04 15:29:07	keveloper	what they do
2017-01-04 15:29:19	keveloper	why was mark confused about that
2017-01-04 15:29:26	na_th_an	"I've noticed that when I hit a dev server I have one IP but then when I hit an external server the IP is different. I don't know what IP will be making a request to easybib and we need that for our easbib api accounts"" 
2017-01-04 15:29:35	na_th_an	what me meant was
2017-01-04 15:30:13	na_th_an	"We need to know the IP that's going to generate the requests for easybib. I don't know if they're coming from the host, the load balancer, or from a seperate proxy"
2017-01-04 15:30:30	na_th_an	but when I mentioned that dui uses squid proxy for external connections and they don't just let you have firewall holes anymore
2017-01-04 15:30:35	na_th_an	he was like "Wtf" and acted very confused
2017-01-04 15:30:43	na_th_an	rashmi asked him to email the network team and ask about it
2017-01-04 15:30:47	na_th_an	and he basically said no
2017-01-04 15:30:51	na_th_an	because he didn't understand the question
2017-01-04 15:30:55	na_th_an	and rashmi asked it for him
2017-01-04 15:31:07	keveloper	ugh
2017-01-04 15:31:38	keveloper	did you say "yes it will use a proxy"
2017-01-04 15:31:42	keveloper	"probably squid proxy"
2017-01-04 15:31:50	keveloper	"the ip will be squid proxies external ip"
2017-01-04 15:38:28	na_th_an	yeah I was telling him it would use a proxy and he was very surprised
2017-01-04 15:41:04	keveloper	peoplesoft is so terrible

2017-01-04 16:00:04	na_th_an	and never heard that agreement between tom, bill and rich
2017-01-04 16:00:15	keveloper	oh

2017-01-04 16:30:55	na_th_an	I can't look at mark's shitty documents any more today

2017-01-04 16:31:19	keveloper	all thats left is duel
2017-01-04 16:31:23	na_th_an	ya
2017-01-04 16:31:25	na_th_an	v proud
2017-01-04 16:31:41	keveloper	feels great
2017-01-04 16:31:44	keveloper	only took 134 matches wow
2017-01-04 16:31:50	keveloper	standard took 247
2017-01-04 16:31:53	keveloper	doubles took 509
2017-01-04 16:32:00	keveloper	only played 71 in duel
2017-01-04 16:32:03	keveloper	at challenger elite
2017-01-04 16:32:09	keveloper	CE D1
2017-01-04 16:32:19	keveloper	hopefully it doesn't take to long to get to rising star there
2017-01-04 16:32:25	keveloper	duel makes too mad
2017-01-04 16:32:51	na_th_an	so you're a teammate blamer
2017-01-04 16:32:52	na_th_an	I see
2017-01-04 16:33:14	keveloper	how does that work
2017-01-04 16:33:21	keveloper	if i get mad at myself in duel
2017-01-04 16:33:40	na_th_an	because you probably get equally mad when you lose in doubles and triples
2017-01-04 16:33:46	na_th_an	but get mad at teammate instead of self
2017-01-04 16:33:51	keveloper	uh no
2017-01-04 16:33:54	keveloper	lol
2017-01-04 16:33:57	na_th_an	idk man
2017-01-04 16:34:00	na_th_an	i think that's how it works
2017-01-04 16:34:26	keveloper	i think duel is the hardest game mode
2017-01-04 16:34:37	keveloper	you cant make mistakes
2017-01-04 16:34:48	keveloper	but not its because mistakes i make are normally cleaned up by my teammate
2017-01-04 16:34:52	keveloper	and dont result in a goal
2017-01-04 16:34:59	keveloper	so i dont get as mad at myself for making mistakes
2017-01-04 16:36:04	keveloper	lol
2017-01-04 16:36:13	keveloper	did you see catfriends wow character

2017-01-04 16:48:10	keveloper	i've had sex with 9 girls

2017-01-04 16:48:28	na_th_an	i've had 2

2017-01-04 16:49:09	keveloper	weird
2017-01-04 16:49:12	keveloper	not as comfrotable
2017-01-04 16:49:24	na_th_an	cuz like, I had sex with my gf in high school but that's hs sex so we didn't know anything

2017-01-04 16:49:36	keveloper	hs sex was all bad lol
2017-01-04 16:49:45	na_th_an	if you say so 
2017-01-04 16:49:49	keveloper	i mean
2017-01-04 16:49:52	keveloper	relatively
2017-01-04 16:50:48	keveloper	now i just have the default mindset that no relationship is permanent
2017-01-04 16:51:02	keveloper	like i expect me and emily to break up
2017-01-04 16:51:05	keveloper	i dont want to
2017-01-04 16:51:09	keveloper	but i just feel like it will happen
2017-01-04 16:51:18	na_th_an	probably a pretty normal feeling
2017-01-04 16:51:21	keveloper	i guess
2017-01-04 16:51:24	na_th_an	I felt like that about haley
2017-01-04 16:51:28	na_th_an	for awhile
2017-01-04 16:51:29	keveloper	what about now
2017-01-04 16:51:40	na_th_an	just like, "this isn't permanent"
2017-01-04 16:51:56	na_th_an	when I was getting close to graduating I kept thinking about how we started dating as high school juniors
2017-01-04 16:52:08	keveloper	the one thing that gets me thinking about emily is like long term issues stemming from religious views
2017-01-04 16:52:15	keveloper	which i mean shouldnt even be an issue
2017-01-04 16:52:19	na_th_an	and I'd think "I wasn't planning on dating haley for 6 years and graduating still together" and kept getting freaked out
2017-01-04 16:52:19	keveloper	she's like hardly catholic
2017-01-04 16:52:39	keveloper	i mean
2017-01-04 16:52:43	na_th_an	idk catholics can be weird about that kind of stuff
2017-01-04 16:52:46	keveloper	i wasn't planning on whoring around all college
2017-01-04 16:52:53	keveloper	about what kind of stuff
2017-01-04 16:53:00	na_th_an	religious things
2017-01-04 16:53:06	na_th_an	like, not being a practicing catholic 
2017-01-04 16:53:10	na_th_an	but then having kids and going to church

2017-01-04 16:58:16	keveloper	she says not until marriage

2017-01-04 16:58:26	na_th_an	that's the dumbest shit
2017-01-04 16:58:28	keveloper	about it*
2017-01-04 16:58:46	na_th_an	when i was really young my mom told me about how my pastor wouldn't let this dude get married in our church
2017-01-04 16:58:47	keveloper	but then she'll be thinking about how she's moving away from that and then try to reinforce
2017-01-04 16:58:53	na_th_an	because he was living with his fiance already
2017-01-04 16:59:04	na_th_an	and my pastor said they had to move out before he'd wed them in our church
2017-01-04 16:59:10	na_th_an	my mom was like "it's a sin"
2017-01-04 16:59:18	keveloper	it

2017-01-04 16:59:21	keveloper	omg
2017-01-04 16:59:24	na_th_an	and I was just thinking like "this seems really dumb and antiquated"
2017-01-04 16:59:25	keveloper	emily doesnt think its a sin
2017-01-04 16:59:37	na_th_an	the people left the church because of it
2017-01-04 16:59:39	na_th_an	like
2017-01-04 16:59:43	na_th_an	are we here to enforce arbitrary rules
2017-01-04 16:59:46	keveloper	she just thinks moving in together should be more speical of a moment
2017-01-04 16:59:47	na_th_an	or love eachother like you guys say
2017-01-04 16:59:50	keveloper	because how she was raised etc.
2017-01-04 17:00:04	na_th_an	my church experience was so bad
2017-01-04 17:00:07	keveloper	but she doesn't think its a sin to move in together
2017-01-04 17:00:10	na_th_an	6,000 year old earch
2017-01-04 17:00:19	keveloper	i've never heard her say anything is a sin lol
2017-01-04 17:00:27	keveloper	she doesn't think that
2017-01-04 17:00:36	na_th_an	"if we can't predict next week's weather, how do we know what the world was like 10,000 years ago? A million? Hundreds of millions?"
2017-01-04 17:00:37	keveloper	we were talkinga bout the special earth theory or whatever that is
2017-01-04 17:00:40	keveloper	she thinks thats stupid
2017-01-04 17:00:47	keveloper	she agrees with evolution
2017-01-04 17:00:51	keveloper	thinks people that dont are dumb
2017-01-04 17:01:15	keveloper	agrees with all science on origins of earth/universe
2017-01-04 17:01:20	keveloper	she is not catholic

2017-01-04 17:01:34	keveloper	but she is in no way catholic
2017-01-04 17:01:34	na_th_an	that kinda goes back to catholics being weird
2017-01-04 17:01:43	na_th_an	the catholic church officially endorses evolution as fact
2017-01-04 17:01:54	na_th_an	the big bang was a theory orginally created by a catholic priest
2017-01-04 17:02:01	keveloper	oh really

2017-01-04 17:02:22	keveloper	she's like "i believe there is something out there"
2017-01-04 17:02:49	na_th_an	dude omg I just thought about this
2017-01-04 17:02:55	keveloper	i think she's more afraid to go against what she thinks her parents want her to do

2017-01-06 12:55:31	keveloper	if
2017-01-06 12:55:40	na_th_an	yes because mark doesn't know how our architecture is supposed to work
2017-01-06 12:55:48	na_th_an	and rashmi wants to talk about the work breakdown and order
2017-01-06 12:55:50	na_th_an	and assign tickets
2017-01-06 12:55:53	na_th_an	and blah blah bullshit

2017-01-06 12:57:37	na_th_an	literally just so she can read our conversations
2017-01-06 12:57:39	na_th_an	and spy on us
2017-01-06 13:41:31	keveloper	i farted its not good

2017-01-06 13:51:36	na_th_an	based on my extended conversations with her
2017-01-06 13:51:43	keveloper	the job market is bad
2017-01-06 13:52:01	na_th_an	the amount that she's unable to read my body language and the way she responds to me legit makes me feel like she's sociopathic
2017-01-06 13:52:06	keveloper	this article's genre is "gay & lesbians"
2017-01-06 13:52:28	keveloper	whats it called

2017-01-06 14:07:36	na_th_an	yeah I know I need to do that
2017-01-06 14:07:56	na_th_an	I should PR with middleware for that since that's standard for remediated applications and this is the remediated template
2017-01-06 14:08:09	keveloper	is that true?
2017-01-06 14:08:14	keveloper	i didnt know if that was an us thing
2017-01-06 14:08:25	na_th_an	no that's part of the standard snowflake compliance
2017-01-06 14:08:29	na_th_an	that OCC is at 8007
2017-01-06 14:08:35	na_th_an	I had to change it for an app or two

2017-01-09 15:03:40	na_th_an	"I don't understand what you're trying to gain from this. It's extra effort and complexity. There's something in software development called YAGNI"

2017-01-09 18:33:30	keveloper	i bet
2017-01-09 18:33:33	na_th_an	12gb might be worth it
2017-01-09 18:33:34	keveloper	what size ram is it

2017-01-09 18:33:49	na_th_an	it's 204 pin ddr3
2017-01-09 18:33:54	na_th_an	it's the only laptop ddr3 memory size

2017-01-09 18:34:38	na_th_an	1333mhz is fine
2017-01-09 18:35:08	na_th_an	you might need some kind of mac specific thing idk
2017-01-09 18:35:09	keveloper	250GB evo is $90
2017-01-09 18:35:23	na_th_an	there are 3 evos

2017-01-09 18:36:12	keveloper	I'm seeing $120 for 2x 8gb
2017-01-09 18:36:22	na_th_an	crucial has a 16gb kit for $80 on prime
2017-01-09 18:36:25	na_th_an	that's not too bad
2017-01-09 18:36:29	keveloper	oh yeah not bad

2017-01-09 18:36:37	keveloper	i have 2 4gb slots
2017-01-09 18:36:41	keveloper	currently
2017-01-09 18:36:42	na_th_an	depends on what you're doing
2017-01-09 18:36:49	keveloper	dev
2017-01-09 18:36:55	keveloper	nothin much else
2017-01-09 18:37:00	na_th_an	i run intellij, backend, webstorm, frontend, db, all at once when I'm devin'
2017-01-09 18:37:00	keveloper	typical internet stuff
2017-01-09 18:37:01	keveloper	streaming
2017-01-09 18:37:09	na_th_an	so 8gb would probably not be enough for that
2017-01-09 18:37:24	keveloper	i dont split up front end and back end
2017-01-09 18:37:27	keveloper	only run intellij

2017-01-09 18:40:09	na_th_an	you could get a laptop that uses standard boot protocols 
2017-01-09 18:40:13	keveloper	-_-

2017-01-09 18:41:40	na_th_an	idk if I were you I'd look at this as a good time to be looking at getting a new laptop with a higher res screen and a normal boot procedure
2017-01-09 18:41:47	na_th_an	but both of those things really matter to me
2017-01-09 18:41:47	keveloper	i asked linux lol

2017-01-09 18:45:01	na_th_an	https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202796
2017-01-09 18:45:04	keveloper	for you

2017-01-09 18:45:38	keveloper	i remembernow
2017-01-09 18:46:12	keveloper	is that not how you install arch
2017-01-09 18:46:39	na_th_an	you might be better off trying to do a clean osx install on it instead of arch
2017-01-09 18:46:50	na_th_an	just because of it being a mac
2017-01-09 18:46:56	keveloper	yeah thats what im thinking
2017-01-09 18:47:00	na_th_an	i really wanna do that to haley's computer
2017-01-09 18:47:06	na_th_an	because her computer is fucked
2017-01-09 18:47:17	keveloper	idk how i'd reinstall onto a diff hard drive

2017-01-09 18:49:47	na_th_an	when you said to get on irc i was hoping it was something more interesting than this

2017-01-10 09:04:16	na_th_an	possible
2017-01-10 09:05:08	na_th_an	if you could hear this wheezing
2017-01-10 09:05:19	keveloper	i think that guy is making a decent proposal in #css and massdebates its just being a douche about it
2017-01-10 09:05:38	na_th_an	i just joined
2017-01-10 09:10:44	keveloper	hey
2017-01-10 09:10:45	keveloper	groovy me
2017-01-10 09:11:10	keveloper	i want to go through a Set of DBs
2017-01-10 09:11:38	keveloper	and only save the ones that have it.openAccess == true
2017-01-10 09:11:42	keveloper	can you do that in a closure
2017-01-10 09:11:54	na_th_an	list.find {}
2017-01-10 09:11:58	keveloper	ahh
2017-01-10 09:12:01	keveloper	will that modify list
2017-01-10 09:12:12	na_th_an	p sure no
2017-01-10 09:12:14	na_th_an	look at docu
2017-01-10 09:12:16	na_th_an	i am not google
2017-01-10 09:12:19	keveloper	yes you are
2017-01-10 09:12:44	na_th_an	my sinuses need to stop this
2017-01-10 09:12:47	na_th_an	this hurts
2017-01-10 09:13:45	keveloper	databaseIDs or databaseIds
2017-01-10 09:13:59	keveloper	because everything in DUI has databaseIds but databaseIDs is more correct
2017-01-10 09:14:27	na_th_an	databaseIds is correct camel case I think
2017-01-10 09:14:35	keveloper	mehhh
2017-01-10 09:14:43	keveloper	blahblahUrl?
2017-01-10 09:14:49	na_th_an	ya
2017-01-10 09:14:53	keveloper	eh
2017-01-10 09:14:53	keveloper	okay
2017-01-10 09:14:54	na_th_an	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15526107/acronyms-in-camelcase
2017-01-10 09:14:55	keveloper	that irks me
2017-01-10 09:15:06	keveloper	Microsoft wrote those guidelines
2017-01-10 09:15:13	na_th_an	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1176950/acronyms-in-camel-back
2017-01-10 09:15:28	na_th_an	most old java uses all caps while newer java (like spring) use camel case
2017-01-10 09:16:49	na_th_an	when mark is at his computer he leans really far forward onto his elbows and it's really weird
2017-01-10 09:17:29	keveloper	is there a way to only do the true half of a ternary exp
2017-01-10 09:17:40	keveloper	like
2017-01-10 09:17:42	na_th_an	idk what you maen
2017-01-10 09:17:42	keveloper	it.openAccess ? databaseIds.add(it)
2017-01-10 09:17:48	keveloper	if false do nothing
2017-01-10 09:17:58	na_th_an	that's when you use an if statement
2017-01-10 09:18:13	keveloper	i know but i just thought this could be short and clean
2017-01-10 09:18:18	keveloper	like thats not a bad use case for that right
2017-01-10 09:18:35	na_th_an	i need more context to be able to help you
2017-01-10 09:18:42	na_th_an	and i don't think you need help with this
2017-01-10 09:19:12	keveloper	lol i don't think it's possible I just thought that'd be a nice short way to write an if with no else
2017-01-10 09:19:29	na_th_an	this isn't c 
2017-01-10 09:19:39	keveloper	you can just do a one line if
2017-01-10 09:19:44	na_th_an	codenarc
2017-01-10 09:19:46	keveloper	if (it.openAccess) databaseIds.add(it.dbId)
2017-01-10 09:19:50	keveloper	yeah i figured codenarc
2017-01-10 09:20:01	keveloper	im just gonna do it the normal boring way
2017-01-10 09:21:05	keveloper	k now i jsut have to remember how to use OWCCUstomQueryFactory
2017-01-10 09:21:31	na_th_an	check out this build.gradle

2017-01-10 13:18:30	na_th_an	and i was like "Honestly I have no idea"
2017-01-10 13:18:39	na_th_an	i told her he made tickets that are very bare and the design docs that aren't done
2017-01-10 13:18:49	keveloper	-_-
2017-01-10 13:19:03	na_th_an	and she went back to our slack channel and is like "Could you both please tell me what you're accomplishing today"
2017-01-10 13:19:06	na_th_an	which is just me, mark and her
2017-01-10 13:19:23	na_th_an	he won't say anything because he never looks at slack
2017-01-10 13:20:25	keveloper	i would be annoyed at the could you both please tell me what youre accomplishing today thing but its clearly to ask mark without offending him
2017-01-10 13:20:48	na_th_an	yeah she told me in that meeting that i was being very direct
2017-01-10 13:20:51	na_th_an	and i'm like 
2017-01-10 13:20:57	keveloper	i dont think she should be afraid of offending him
2017-01-10 13:21:00	na_th_an	how about you fucking be direct for once instead of coating everything in manager speak
2017-01-10 13:21:12	keveloper	she should be able tot alk to him
2017-01-10 13:21:27	na_th_an	"Mark, what are you working on? Please keep me informed on this, either directly or through JIRA."
2017-01-10 13:21:33	na_th_an	but that's too hard
2017-01-10 13:21:42	na_th_an	"Mark, you never look at slack. Please be more involved in team communication"
2017-01-10 13:21:44	na_th_an	nope
2017-01-10 13:21:51	na_th_an	sigh

2017-01-10 13:24:26	na_th_an	"I tried to get them to do it and middleware doesn't know how, and they aren't doing anything about it"
2017-01-10 13:24:30	na_th_an	and asking him
2017-01-10 13:24:33	na_th_an	how do we get it installed

2017-01-10 13:24:56	na_th_an	i told this to ed
2017-01-10 13:24:59	na_th_an	at least twice
2017-01-10 13:25:06	na_th_an	he emails tom this afternoon
2017-01-10 13:25:15	na_th_an	that we're waiting on isoft to install to the PRT machines
2017-01-10 13:25:26	na_th_an	and that "Nathan/Kevin have also pinged them"
2017-01-10 13:25:28	na_th_an	yes we did
2017-01-10 13:25:30	na_th_an	weeks ago
2017-01-10 13:25:34	na_th_an	and I told you that they aren't working on it
2017-01-10 13:25:37	na_th_an	because they don't know what to do
2017-01-10 13:25:43	na_th_an	and I don't know what to tell them
2017-01-10 13:26:05	keveloper	-_-
2017-01-10 13:26:06	keveloper	idk man
2017-01-10 13:26:14	na_th_an	I also have no idea how to open this file he put on the jira ticket

2017-01-10 13:26:36	keveloper	what is it
2017-01-10 13:26:39	na_th_an	no ed
2017-01-10 13:26:42	na_th_an	he attached an email chain
2017-01-10 13:26:42	keveloper	oh

2017-01-10 13:29:55	keveloper	everytime rashmi walks by im like *dont talk to me dont talk to me dont talk to... phew*
2017-01-10 13:38:03	na_th_an	I'm emailing bill, tom and you about the isoft install
2017-01-10 13:38:15	na_th_an	telling them that we asked middleware to do it and they said they don't know how
2017-01-10 13:38:19	na_th_an	and ed doesn't know how
2017-01-10 13:38:22	na_th_an	and i don't know how
2017-01-10 13:38:26	na_th_an	and I don't know how I should be helping them
2017-01-10 13:38:52	na_th_an	mark is so asleep
2017-01-10 13:39:03	na_th_an	just like
2017-01-10 13:39:05	na_th_an	are you kidding me
2017-01-10 13:41:04	keveloper	-_-
2017-01-10 13:42:13	na_th_an	the isoft install situation is basically middleware pointing at us saying "this is your application" and us pointing at middleware saying "these are your scripts and your environment and your deploy software and your filesystems and your username and your tools"
2017-01-10 13:45:30	na_th_an	yo
2017-01-10 13:45:35	na_th_an	https://0bin.net/paste/wst-hbXBUALBF+Zz#0lyGGOcL-Qjc3HUWXxE1P59TIfWpxuywtJfhxJ5b8rW

2017-01-10 13:49:03	keveloper	1 time access
2017-01-10 13:49:06	na_th_an	so now I'm editing it again
2017-01-10 13:49:41	keveloper	you should just do what mark does in these situations
2017-01-10 13:50:37	na_th_an	sleep?
2017-01-10 13:53:35	keveloper	ep
2017-01-10 13:53:36	keveloper	yep

2017-01-10 13:54:06	keveloper	but still be in them
2017-01-10 13:54:14	na_th_an	Middleware responded saying they think we'll need help from AppSupport and added Kevin Agullana. I don't know if Kevin Agullana can provide assistance here or not.
2017-01-10 13:54:16	na_th_an	From what I can gather, the current situation is that we don't know how to install iSoft and can't find anyone who does.
2017-01-10 13:54:25	na_th_an	like mute them on your status line? probably
2017-01-10 13:54:25	keveloper	yep

2017-01-10 13:59:25	na_th_an	i don't know anything about --no-rebuild besides its existance

2017-01-10 14:02:53	keveloper	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-01-10 14:03:27	na_th_an	you are dumb
2017-01-10 14:03:30	na_th_an	I wanted to let you know
2017-01-10 14:04:31	keveloper	:'(
2017-01-10 14:04:31	keveloper	rood
2017-01-10 14:04:52	na_th_an	how long until mark has an issue and i say
2017-01-10 14:04:54	na_th_an	"Did you pull?"
2017-01-10 14:05:05	na_th_an	and then he has tons of merge conflicts because he hasn't done a pull in 2 weeks
2017-01-10 14:05:22	keveloper	2 weeks from now
2017-01-10 14:17:01	na_th_an	harika is talking about virtualbox with bryan
2017-01-10 14:17:07	keveloper	no kevin no
2017-01-10 14:17:08	keveloper	2 hosts
2017-01-10 14:17:09	na_th_an	that's worries me
2017-01-10 14:17:09	keveloper	not 8
2017-01-10 14:17:16	na_th_an	no it goes on them all
2017-01-10 14:17:19	keveloper	OH
2017-01-10 14:17:19	keveloper	ok
2017-01-10 14:17:20	keveloper	jk
2017-01-10 14:17:23	na_th_an	yeah idk
2017-01-10 14:17:25	na_th_an	that's what ed said
2017-01-10 14:17:33	na_th_an	and what the Firstsearch.ini file says
2017-01-10 15:11:13	na_th_an	I don't think these feature teams are going to go that well in the long run
2017-01-10 15:45:47	keveloper	why not
2017-01-10 15:47:08	na_th_an	increased amount of "idk what's going on"
2017-01-10 15:47:20	na_th_an	limited tech lead resources are now spread across multiple projects
2017-01-10 15:47:42	na_th_an	fewer people are able to effectively review code (I have no idea what's on this feature branch.... approved I guess)
2017-01-10 15:48:07	na_th_an	huge changes going into dui without other people knowing about how it was designed and implemented (I have no idea how temp items work)
2017-01-10 15:48:25	na_th_an	more projects happening at once => more tech lead design and estimation that has to be done
2017-01-10 15:48:30	na_th_an	especially with rashmi's style of management
2017-01-10 15:48:50	na_th_an	more confusion around installs and releases (idk whose code is in here, I've been on team _______)
2017-01-10 15:49:04	na_th_an	vacations and sick time affecting teams more (if I get sick, mark can't pick up my work)
2017-01-10 15:49:35	na_th_an	but I know if I bring up any of these to rashmi the only response will be 20 minutes of manager speak where I can't even talk and my concerns aren't even addressed
2017-01-10 16:58:05	keveloper	i dint get a stand up
2017-01-10 16:58:07	keveloper	dont
2017-01-10 16:58:11	na_th_an	hi
2017-01-10 16:58:30	na_th_an	rashmi came over and talked to me and mark about rich helping with citations
2017-01-10 16:58:46	keveloper	why dont me and charles get a standup
2017-01-10 16:58:52	keveloper	or prt snowflake
2017-01-10 16:58:55	na_th_an	she's like "rich can start working on some components"
2017-01-10 16:58:57	na_th_an	and mark was like "there's only two components, the UI and the backend"
2017-01-10 16:59:13	na_th_an	and rashmi looks at me and maintains eye contact until I confirm or deny mark's technical assertion
2017-01-10 16:59:18	na_th_an	because she doesn't trust anything he says 
2017-01-10 16:59:22	na_th_an	so she looks at me to confirm it
2017-01-10 16:59:28	na_th_an	and it really bothers me
2017-01-10 16:59:34	keveloper	and you were like
2017-01-10 16:59:38	keveloper	ya tru
2017-01-10 16:59:42	na_th_an	if you don't trust this person's answers he shouldn't be fucking in charge
2017-01-10 16:59:46	keveloper	lol
2017-01-10 17:00:01	na_th_an	some of the things mark was saying just now
2017-01-10 17:00:04	na_th_an	he's like
2017-01-10 17:00:11	na_th_an	"I'm looking at DUI and the directory structure it uses"
2017-01-10 17:00:24	na_th_an	hes' like "I'm wondering if we should copy over these Json classes"
2017-01-10 17:00:29	na_th_an	"or if we'll even need those"
2017-01-10 17:00:29	keveloper	lol
2017-01-10 17:00:35	na_th_an	and I'm like "wtf why would you do that"
2017-01-10 17:00:53	na_th_an	he's like "I'm looking through and there's all these annotations and configuration, I'm not sure if they do anything"
2017-01-10 17:00:55	na_th_an	meaning
2017-01-10 17:00:58	na_th_an	he has no idea how to use spring
2017-01-10 17:01:16	na_th_an	I'm going to come back to a completely fucked up project
2017-01-10 17:01:27	na_th_an	I wanted to say "make a separate module for the controller"
2017-01-10 17:01:31	na_th_an	but I know he couldn't figure that out
2017-01-10 17:01:44	na_th_an	sorry a lot of shit happened since you left that's worth ranting about
2017-01-10 19:39:16	keveloper	he's ridiculous

2017-01-11 08:53:28	keveloper	and we dont have to provide proof or anything for most sick time

2017-01-11 09:41:10	na_th_an	but ya if you don't understand networking at all then that stuff can be kinda hard
2017-01-11 09:41:14	na_th_an	like if you don't know what dns is
2017-01-11 09:41:38	keveloper	and i was like something with windows can use your hostname to hit your local

2017-01-11 11:03:55	keveloper	did you know we only use 10% of our brain at a time :O
2017-01-11 11:03:56	keveloper	lol

2017-01-11 11:04:40	keveloper	emily said something about why deja vu happens and it was like wrong
2017-01-11 11:04:43	keveloper	i forget what it was
2017-01-11 11:05:27	keveloper	and i was like "no it has to do something with the memory being pushed to long term memory while you are experiencing it so you are both recalling it from long term memory and experiencing it at the same time so it feels like a memory"
2017-01-11 11:05:31	keveloper	is how i understand it
2017-01-11 11:05:33	keveloper	and she got mad
2017-01-11 11:05:44	keveloper	because i was like "no actually"
2017-01-11 11:05:52	keveloper	and i was like well im not gonna just let you believe the incorrect thing lol
2017-01-11 11:06:00	keveloper	i'm not like HEY YOURE WRONG
2017-01-11 11:06:03	keveloper	im wrong about a lot of shit
2017-01-11 11:06:11	keveloper	and if i am plz tell me liek
2017-01-11 11:06:13	keveloper	thats ok
2017-01-11 11:07:07	na_th_an	we don't really know anything about deja vu afaik
2017-01-11 11:07:16	keveloper	i think that is the leading theory
2017-01-11 11:07:22	na_th_an	haley gets mad whenever I "no actually" her
2017-01-11 11:07:32	na_th_an	i've never heard that before
2017-01-11 11:07:35	keveloper	oh really
2017-01-11 11:07:37	na_th_an	but i also don't research dejavu ever
2017-01-11 11:07:44	na_th_an	i have no reason to believe you are right or wrong
2017-01-11 11:07:59	keveloper	that's what i have heard
2017-01-11 11:07:59	keveloper	but
2017-01-11 11:08:00	keveloper	maybe not
2017-01-11 11:08:04	keveloper	i mean im probably wrong lol
2017-01-11 11:08:14	na_th_an	i heard that while you're sleeping you eat 8 spiders a year
2017-01-11 11:08:16	na_th_an	9 if you're gay
2017-01-11 11:08:35	na_th_an	shit I should have watered my spider plant before I left
2017-01-11 11:08:38	keveloper	emily is very bad at admitting wrongness
2017-01-11 11:08:50	keveloper	i like to think i'm pretty good at it
2017-01-11 11:08:58	keveloper	probably b ecause of CS lol
2017-01-11 11:09:01	keveloper	i'm wrong literally everyday
2017-01-11 11:09:14	keveloper	'i think this is the issue' 'wow no that was not the issue at all'
2017-01-11 11:10:43	keveloper	the theory im talking about is called Dual Processing
2017-01-11 11:10:57	keveloper	another common one is divided attention theory
2017-01-11 11:11:37	keveloper	http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/deja-vu4.htm
2017-01-11 11:12:42	keveloper	the thing emily said i think is that you experienced it in a dream before so it seems real
2017-01-11 11:12:45	keveloper	and im like no that is not right
2017-01-11 11:13:06	keveloper	also that's called a precognitive dream
2017-01-11 11:13:12	keveloper	if that has actually ever happened
2017-01-11 11:13:24	na_th_an	did you ever see the movie preminition
2017-01-11 11:14:59	na_th_an	mark just asked me if he's supposed to use extends or implements
2017-01-11 11:15:50	keveloper	no
2017-01-11 11:15:56	keveloper	did he really
2017-01-11 11:15:57	keveloper	for what
2017-01-11 11:16:07	keveloper	k he is literally a sophomore in college
2017-01-11 11:16:15	na_th_an	yes
2017-01-11 11:16:18	na_th_an	he actually asked me that
2017-01-11 11:16:29	keveloper	how did he get to this point
2017-01-11 11:16:30	na_th_an	I said that you extend a class and implement an interface
2017-01-11 11:16:40	na_th_an	he just stopped and looked kinda confused
2017-01-11 11:16:41	keveloper	like how was nobody like "should we really give him more money" "nah"
2017-01-11 11:16:48	na_th_an	and now he just said "this is hard to think about"
2017-01-11 11:17:03	keveloper	looks like he's googling some inheritance terms
2017-01-11 11:17:12	na_th_an	jesus christ
2017-01-11 11:17:14	keveloper	he's on stack overflow
2017-01-11 11:17:29	na_th_an	i kinda want to tell rashmi that working on this project with mark is worse than snowflake because he doesn't know anything
2017-01-11 11:17:30	keveloper	yeah that's definitely an inheritance exmaple
2017-01-11 11:17:33	na_th_an	because this is just awful
2017-01-11 11:17:38	keveloper	i can recognize those from a mile away
2017-01-11 11:17:43	keveloper	unless you do it alone
2017-01-11 11:17:46	keveloper	they should take mark off
2017-01-11 11:17:49	na_th_an	i'd rather do it alone

2017-01-16 09:00:38	na_th_an	I'm not sure if rashmi understands the point of dilbert or not
2017-01-16 09:01:39	na_th_an	Purpose of this meeting is to review the currently stories for Citations Epic and discuss what the must haves Vs the fast followers are. Given the recent sizing, we are way over the initial estimates.(We will have a separate lessons learned about the change in sizing)
2017-01-16 09:01:44	na_th_an	I don't even understand that first sentence
2017-01-16 09:03:09	keveloper	the fast followers man
2017-01-16 09:03:37	keveloper	yeah i dont get her dilbert comics
2017-01-16 09:03:49	na_th_an	I don't think she understands the satire
2017-01-16 09:04:17	keveloper	what are fast followers
2017-01-16 09:04:22	na_th_an	i have no idea
2017-01-16 09:04:24	na_th_an	what are Vs
2017-01-16 09:04:31	na_th_an	I forgot more cereal and i'm alomst out rip
2017-01-16 09:04:35	keveloper	versus.....
2017-01-16 09:04:43	na_th_an	it just became a piada day
2017-01-16 09:04:44	na_th_an	oh
2017-01-16 09:04:46	keveloper	idk if joke
2017-01-16 09:04:50	na_th_an	dude idk with rashmi talk
2017-01-16 09:04:58	na_th_an	oh ok
2017-01-16 09:05:07	na_th_an	I was reading "what the must have Vs the fast followers are"
2017-01-16 09:05:15	na_th_an	I wasn't reading the plural 'haves'
2017-01-16 09:05:39	keveloper	someone needs to teach her "vs."
2017-01-16 09:05:48	keveloper	she always writes Vs
2017-01-16 09:05:48	na_th_an	fast followers are post release enhancements
2017-01-16 09:05:51	na_th_an	that are fast
2017-01-16 09:05:54	na_th_an	I've never seen that
2017-01-16 09:05:57	na_th_an	that's so wrong 
2017-01-16 09:08:32	keveloper	arent you guys just writing a service
2017-01-16 09:08:35	keveloper	in one go
2017-01-16 09:08:40	keveloper	and releasing the finished service
2017-01-16 09:08:51	na_th_an	that's the idea right now
2017-01-16 09:09:04	na_th_an	but easybib uses volume number, page range, shit like that in citations
2017-01-16 09:09:08	keveloper	so there will be no followers
2017-01-16 09:09:11	na_th_an	but that's all just one string
2017-01-16 09:09:21	na_th_an	and I guess mela didn't know that for some reason
2017-01-16 09:09:28	na_th_an	and it never came up
2017-01-16 09:09:36	na_th_an	and so mela wants that in citations
2017-01-16 09:09:44	na_th_an	mark thinks it's no big deal (except it is)
2017-01-16 09:09:48	na_th_an	but we can't parse it 
2017-01-16 09:10:00	na_th_an	so now we're freaking out about expanding the scope
2017-01-16 09:10:13	na_th_an	in addition to having estimates that are apparently higher than original estimates or something?
2017-01-16 09:10:24	na_th_an	and also nobody has written a single actual line of code except me
2017-01-16 09:10:40	na_th_an	the project is going great
2017-01-16 09:10:56	keveloper	why cant you parse it
2017-01-16 09:11:02	na_th_an	unrelated, I'm trying to provision servers and none of these 'projects' make any sense
2017-01-16 09:11:05	na_th_an	well we CAN
2017-01-16 09:11:09	na_th_an	but they're in like 100 different formats
2017-01-16 09:11:31	na_th_an	according to mark some other team spent a few months writing code to parse this so now we're thinking about adding this into DS?
2017-01-16 09:12:13	na_th_an	It's all just shit like "Vol 2.1 (22-23)" or "Volume 2 Issue 3 33-40" or all kinds of weird shit
2017-01-16 09:12:18	keveloper	so volume number and page range are one string?
2017-01-16 09:12:20	keveloper	oh
2017-01-16 09:12:35	keveloper	is there enough data to train a neural net on it
2017-01-16 09:12:37	keveloper	probably
2017-01-16 09:12:56	na_th_an	mark is being extra loud today
2017-01-16 09:26:43	keveloper	all i wanna do is strip out this shitty url rewriting but i can't find it
2017-01-16 09:27:45	na_th_an	oh go
2017-01-16 09:27:47	na_th_an	god
2017-01-16 09:27:49	na_th_an	haley just texted me
2017-01-16 09:27:54	na_th_an	"Do you guys have a toilet plunger?"
2017-01-16 09:27:56	na_th_an	we do not
2017-01-16 09:28:00	keveloper	lol
2017-01-16 09:28:08	keveloper	why not
2017-01-16 09:28:13	keveloper	thats like an essential household item

2017-01-16 10:04:35	na_th_an	so that mark can try to tell me what happened but not communicate it well
2017-01-16 10:04:40	na_th_an	and so I can sit here with nothing to do
2017-01-16 10:04:49	na_th_an	because mark couldn't explain fast enough
2017-01-16 10:09:00	keveloper	wait so why arent you at meeting
2017-01-16 10:09:12	na_th_an	because I'm "not needed"
2017-01-16 10:09:17	na_th_an	so I can work on something else
2017-01-16 10:09:21	na_th_an	but I have nothing else to work on 
2017-01-16 10:09:30	na_th_an	except look at how swagger works so I can fix the api definitions that mark can't figure out 
2017-01-16 10:17:41	keveloper	lol

2017-01-16 10:20:10	na_th_an	that's why I have nothing to do rn
2017-01-16 10:20:14	na_th_an	besides look in general at swagger
2017-01-16 10:20:15	na_th_an	and reply to email

2017-01-16 10:42:38	na_th_an	mark is so confused
2017-01-16 10:42:53	na_th_an	rashmi is freaking out about estimates
2017-01-16 10:43:34	na_th_an	mark said that "our estimates" (which I don't agree with at all) are 480 hours but the original are 300 and now rashmi's asking how much we can do in 300?
2017-01-16 10:46:14	na_th_an	let's see how long it takes mark to send me his definition...
2017-01-16 10:46:24	na_th_an	mtn dew #2 of the day

2017-01-16 10:50:04	na_th_an	which was fighting stupid management things
2017-01-16 10:50:05	keveloper	why was he coding in dui in july of 2015
2017-01-16 10:50:16	na_th_an	he was willing to be vocal about stupid decisions
2017-01-16 10:50:23	keveloper	this code isn't even correct
2017-01-16 10:50:23	na_th_an	and fight for the development side of things
2017-01-16 10:50:28	na_th_an	his actual coding abilities, I agree
2017-01-16 10:50:38	na_th_an	when you stop coding frequently you lose coding skills
2017-01-16 10:50:40	keveloper	like i read it
2017-01-16 10:50:43	keveloper	and was instantly like
2017-01-16 10:50:45	keveloper	"oh thats wrong"

2017-01-16 10:53:08	keveloper	omgomgomgomg
2017-01-16 10:53:12	na_th_an	it's just so wrong that I don't know what to do
2017-01-16 10:53:17	keveloper	30+ YEARS OF EXPERIENCC E
2017-01-16 10:53:38	na_th_an	I need to take a walk
2017-01-16 10:53:50	keveloper	i wanna come oh by envm okay
2017-01-16 10:54:55	keveloper	just do like /cite
2017-01-16 10:54:58	keveloper	or something
2017-01-16 10:55:10	keveloper	unless you have a diff controller for each format
2017-01-16 10:56:18	keveloper	/book/DiscoveryUI/32145432/91475/OSU/chiacgo
2017-01-16 10:56:24	keveloper	lol that doesn't make any sense
2017-01-16 10:56:28	keveloper	like remotely any sense at all
2017-01-16 10:57:15	na_th_an	dude
2017-01-16 10:57:31	na_th_an	 /cite is LITERALLY what I have in the code rn
2017-01-16 10:58:48	keveloper	can't everything else be posted
2017-01-16 10:58:55	na_th_an	yes
2017-01-16 10:58:56	keveloper	he's trying way to hard to make it seem complicated
2017-01-16 10:59:03	na_th_an	no I think what it was 
2017-01-16 10:59:17	na_th_an	is that the only thing he saw in swagger was how to do path variables
2017-01-16 10:59:27	na_th_an	and he can't figure anything else out
2017-01-16 11:01:36	na_th_an	for some reason he's using json instead of yaml
2017-01-16 11:01:44	na_th_an	he called yaml "that config thing that swagger made"
2017-01-16 11:02:00	keveloper	tbf i didn't know what yaml was until ubiquity
2017-01-16 11:02:44	na_th_an	the point is that he can't communicate at all because he doesn't know any words to describe what he's thinking about
2017-01-16 11:03:03	na_th_an	so instead of saying "connection reset" or "dns lookup error" he says "I can't hook into the DR"
2017-01-16 11:06:47	keveloper	$120k
2017-01-16 11:07:05	na_th_an	angela fixed the rest path that mark made at least
2017-01-16 11:07:07	keveloper	if they are going for a emotion
2017-01-16 11:07:14	keveloper	demotion*
2017-01-16 11:07:17	keveloper	whatd she change it to
2017-01-16 11:07:18	na_th_an	probably
2017-01-16 11:07:28	keveloper	if they are going for a demotion he needs to be demoted to grade 15
2017-01-16 11:07:29	na_th_an	 /book
2017-01-16 11:07:33	na_th_an	seriously thou
2017-01-16 11:07:34	keveloper	and we need to be promoted to 17
2017-01-16 11:07:42	keveloper	should it even be /book though
2017-01-16 11:07:45	na_th_an	he has market value around 60k
2017-01-16 11:07:49	na_th_an	no probably not
2017-01-16 11:07:52	na_th_an	well
2017-01-16 11:07:59	keveloper	because you dont want diff contorller for every format
2017-01-16 11:08:01	na_th_an	i think they want a different payload for each format
2017-01-16 11:08:13	na_th_an	i'm not sure because we don't have the design set 
2017-01-16 11:08:19	na_th_an	because mark has no idea what he's doing
2017-01-16 11:08:26	keveloper	then you can post every request with different data
2017-01-16 11:08:44	na_th_an	idk, idc about that as much
2017-01-16 11:08:44	keveloper	the controller doesn't need to care what format it is if its just passing it on to a service with a converter
2017-01-16 11:08:49	keveloper	true
2017-01-16 11:08:51	na_th_an	the converter 
2017-01-16 11:08:55	na_th_an	the converter is in dui
2017-01-16 11:09:02	na_th_an	don't worry about our design
2017-01-16 11:09:06	keveloper	im not
2017-01-16 11:16:00	na_th_an	before I worked here I disliked when people loudly went "ahhhh" after drinking
2017-01-16 11:16:10	keveloper	no you love it
2017-01-16 11:16:16	keveloper	now*
2017-01-16 11:16:24	na_th_an	mark does it because he has to catch his breath
2017-01-16 11:17:26	keveloper	is harika talkinga bout a defect
2017-01-16 11:17:29	keveloper	or triage
2017-01-16 11:18:05	keveloper	she's supposed to be fixing the testingeus app but
2017-01-16 11:18:38	keveloper	i dont think we are using core ui right in the detailed record
2017-01-16 11:28:56	keveloper	/ this prevents email dialog code conflict between here and action panel
2017-01-16 11:28:56	keveloper	            $main = $('#detailed_record_page').find('#main');
2017-01-16 11:28:59	keveloper	javascript is good
2017-01-16 11:29:03	keveloper	best language
2017-01-16 11:29:17	keveloper	(different files)
2017-01-16 11:29:42	na_th_an	that's not really a "js is bad" thing so much as a "we suck at UI" thing
2017-01-16 11:29:48	keveloper	true
2017-01-16 11:29:51	keveloper	scope though
2017-01-16 11:29:52	keveloper	in JS
2017-01-16 11:30:04	na_th_an	we should have made shirts for codemash 
2017-01-16 11:30:10	keveloper	yeah
2017-01-16 11:30:12	na_th_an	"We still use jQuery. Please hire us."
2017-01-16 11:30:22	keveloper	oh i thought you meant oclc
2017-01-16 11:30:25	na_th_an	I do
2017-01-16 11:30:26	keveloper	oclc needs to step up the game
2017-01-16 11:30:32	na_th_an	they would say oclc on the back
2017-01-16 11:30:52	keveloper	a lot of companies still use jquery lol
2017-01-16 11:31:20	na_th_an	yeah but some don't
2017-01-16 11:31:24	na_th_an	and I want one of them to hire me
2017-01-16 11:31:28	keveloper	kroger
2017-01-16 11:31:30	keveloper	i need kroger
2017-01-16 11:31:32	na_th_an	srsly
2017-01-16 11:32:33	keveloper	https://jobs.kroger.com/kroger/job/Blue-Ash-Java-Developer-OH-45242/371156600/
2017-01-16 11:32:36	keveloper	mine
2017-01-16 11:32:37	keveloper	called it
2017-01-16 11:32:53	keveloper	thats far away
2017-01-16 11:33:02	keveloper	near cinci
2017-01-16 11:36:26	keveloper	i cannot for the life of me find why this is happening
2017-01-16 11:36:49	na_th_an	oh shit it's lunch
2017-01-16 11:36:54	keveloper	yes it is

2017-01-16 12:26:28	na_th_an	mark's asked me that at least 5 times
2017-01-16 12:28:00	na_th_an	we came back at the worst time
2017-01-16 12:28:49	keveloper	what do you mean
2017-01-16 12:28:52	keveloper	oh is he eating
2017-01-16 12:31:03	na_th_an	eating v loud

2017-01-16 12:32:17	keveloper	k im still lost on this fragment thing
2017-01-16 12:34:23	keveloper	k so
2017-01-16 12:34:23	keveloper	/prevents default action of hyperlink when js is enabled.
2017-01-16 12:34:29	keveloper	core ui prevents the link
2017-01-16 12:34:44	keveloper	so we break that some how lol
2017-01-16 12:35:43	keveloper	how bout we uhhh dont put the href there if we dont want to use it??? idk just a shot in the dark over here
2017-01-16 12:36:36	na_th_an	yeah the only way you can open/close dialogs in coreui is by clicking on a link
2017-01-16 12:36:40	na_th_an	doesn't that make sense to you?
2017-01-16 12:37:00	keveloper	yes every sense
2017-01-16 12:37:25	keveloper	i ahve no idea how we break this prevent default from core ui
2017-01-16 12:37:33	keveloper	something in detailed record main has to break it
2017-01-16 12:39:06	keveloper	is harika talking about defects or triage
2017-01-16 12:39:08	keveloper	i am curious
2017-01-16 12:39:11	na_th_an	i have no idea
2017-01-16 12:39:15	na_th_an	i just took my headphones out
2017-01-16 12:42:49	keveloper	he said form data he did it
2017-01-16 12:46:42	na_th_an	huh
2017-01-16 12:47:43	na_th_an	mark was very skeptical that we shouldn't have the institution, symbol, oclc number, etc on the url string
2017-01-16 12:49:07	keveloper	why is !important in core ui so much
2017-01-16 12:49:11	keveloper	lol
2017-01-16 12:49:13	keveloper	poor mark
2017-01-16 12:49:19	na_th_an	because we're bad at UI
2017-01-16 12:49:26	na_th_an	I just had to tell him "that's not how REST works"
2017-01-16 12:49:44	keveloper	this file is so gross
2017-01-16 12:49:50	keveloper	academic_customization.jsp
2017-01-16 12:50:19	keveloper	its embedded css in a jsp with a bunch of c:if blocks for setting inst stuff
2017-01-16 13:09:34	na_th_an	I want to be out of this snowflake/prt "let's not include nathan/kevin to this email" shit
2017-01-16 13:14:39	na_th_an	omg in this swagger definition...
2017-01-16 13:14:44	na_th_an	for a parameter
2017-01-16 13:14:55	na_th_an	"A urlencoded JSON object containing the citation information forthe book"
2017-01-16 13:15:15	na_th_an	mark's plan was to put a URL encoded json object on the path....???
2017-01-16 13:37:39	keveloper	are you serious
2017-01-16 13:37:50	keveloper	like wtf

2017-01-16 13:39:06	na_th_an	idfk
2017-01-16 13:39:13	na_th_an	I told bill this was an issue awhile ago
2017-01-16 13:39:24	na_th_an	and he literally sent an email asking for us to be included on all future firstsearch emails
2017-01-16 13:39:26	na_th_an	and they still don't
2017-01-16 13:39:38	keveloper	oh that
2017-01-16 13:39:39	na_th_an	swagger web editor keeps crashing
2017-01-16 13:39:41	na_th_an	it's happened twice
2017-01-16 13:39:58	keveloper	write your own
2017-01-16 13:39:59	na_th_an	yeah you don't deal with it much because you ran away from FS successfully unlike me :(
2017-01-16 13:40:49	keveloper	:'(
2017-01-16 13:41:09	keveloper	i have located the file that it the fragment thing happens in
2017-01-16 14:05:48	keveloper	I FOUND IT

2017-01-16 14:12:43	na_th_an	i have $10 in my pocket
2017-01-16 16:03:35	na_th_an	"I talked to a Swagger developer (Ron) about this on IRC and he confirmed this is a bug in the web client, not an error in the schema definition."
2017-01-16 16:03:44	na_th_an	is that best inter-team communication ever or what
2017-01-16 16:12:54	keveloper	lol best
2017-01-16 16:14:03	na_th_an	mark was doing this swagger api definition entirely wrong
2017-01-16 16:14:14	na_th_an	he had every parameter as a formData parameter
2017-01-16 16:14:20	na_th_an	... we aren't sending a form
2017-01-16 16:14:35	na_th_an	"but it looks like json! it's the same thing"
2017-01-16 16:14:48	na_th_an	no, not if you want to have objects/arrays in the requset.... which we do
2017-01-16 16:40:46	na_th_an	ok so I did a swagger api definition in less than a day after mark spent two days on it
2017-01-16 16:41:21	na_th_an	maybe only a day idk
2017-01-16 16:41:24	na_th_an	but he was WAY off

2017-01-17 09:16:59	keveloper	it doesnt make a lot of sense
2017-01-17 09:19:29	na_th_an	it means rashmi doesn't understand what a ddos is and wants to sound smart
2017-01-17 09:19:54	keveloper	she said it like its a fact that its a distributed attack
2017-01-17 09:19:57	na_th_an	"look at this people that are ddosing us but purposely doing it at a low enough rate to not notify our performance notification thresholds!
2017-01-17 09:20:00	na_th_an	that makes no sense

2017-01-17 12:23:07	keveloper	If I limit the time between 12/28 and 1/1, you can see client names like “Other”, “Iceweasel”, “SeaMonkey”, “IceCat”, “Shiira”, “Maxthon”:
2017-01-17 12:23:12	keveloper	If you scroll down to the bottom of the page, you can see all the searches were against "tudelft.on.worldcat.org”, but the client ip and client country varies (Colombia, Egypt, Thailand, Russian, China, India, etc). Looks like it is a co-ordinated effort from many countries.
2017-01-17 12:23:33	keveloper	jinbin sent that to rashmi which is why she thinks its a distributed attack
2017-01-17 12:24:01	keveloper	i used to use maxthon
2017-01-17 12:24:07	keveloper	iceweasel is a linux browser right
2017-01-17 12:24:26	keveloper	thats a FF fork
2017-01-17 12:24:38	na_th_an	yeah iceweasel is the fork that's distributed with debian
2017-01-17 12:25:00	na_th_an	i don't know if you can call it an attack
2017-01-17 12:25:04	keveloper	SeaMonkey is llike an old mozilla thing
2017-01-17 12:25:08	na_th_an	yeah
2017-01-17 12:25:09	keveloper	yeah these are just alternate browsers
2017-01-17 12:25:12	na_th_an	yeah
2017-01-17 12:25:18	na_th_an	they are just forks
2017-01-17 12:25:23	keveloper	Shiira is open source for OS X
2017-01-17 12:25:27	keveloper	maxthon i used to use
2017-01-17 12:25:28	keveloper	so
2017-01-17 12:25:36	keveloper	all of those check out
2017-01-17 12:26:02	keveloper	co-ordinated effort from many countries lol what
2017-01-17 12:27:13	na_th_an	yeah idk
2017-01-17 12:29:53	keveloper	what does missing field mean
2017-01-17 12:30:39	na_th_an	it means that the event doesn't have that field
2017-01-17 12:30:43	na_th_an	it's missing the field
2017-01-17 12:31:07	keveloper	ah
2017-01-17 12:32:20	na_th_an	i have no idea why marcus thinks that firstsearch is up
2017-01-17 12:32:29	na_th_an	unless he means deployed and not activated
2017-01-17 12:32:37	na_th_an	in which case i have no idea how to tell
2017-01-17 12:33:28	na_th_an	i wish it paid off to be good at my job here
2017-01-17 12:33:59	keveloper	kibana is literally just like stuck
2017-01-17 12:34:04	na_th_an	yeah it does that
2017-01-17 12:34:08	keveloper	sweet
2017-01-17 12:34:15	na_th_an	sometimes the whole thing gets so fucked you have to ask middleware to fix it
2017-01-17 12:36:13	keveloper	doing another 7 day load lol
2017-01-17 12:36:22	keveloper	just gotta wait 5 minutes

2017-01-17 12:43:23	keveloper	there ya go what
2017-01-17 12:43:31	keveloper	that explains the weird browsers
2017-01-17 12:43:33	na_th_an	why you have random traffic from different contries
2017-01-17 12:43:33	keveloper	and the spread location
2017-01-17 12:43:36	keveloper	yeah
2017-01-17 12:43:41	na_th_an	why do we think we're under attack again
2017-01-17 12:43:48	keveloper	idfk
2017-01-17 12:43:58	keveloper	heres why: firefly is having longer response times
2017-01-17 12:44:09	keveloper	DUI is having more than normal searches with 0 results
2017-01-17 12:44:10	na_th_an	so it's our problem?
2017-01-17 12:44:12	keveloper	idfk
2017-01-17 12:44:18	na_th_an	it's our problem that firefly sucks?
2017-01-17 12:44:25	keveloper	none of these searches are a concern
2017-01-17 12:44:41	keveloper	this still confuses me kw: history + ( (x0:book+x4:printbook) ) + ( (s1:28228000) ) + ( (ln:Eng) )
2017-01-17 12:44:58	keveloper	oh shit that works lol okay
2017-01-17 12:45:02	na_th_an	maybe the OR gets translated to | 
2017-01-17 12:45:07	na_th_an	and AND gets translated to +
2017-01-17 12:45:14	keveloper	maybe
2017-01-17 12:45:20	keveloper	very possible
2017-01-17 12:46:18	keveloper	the thing i pasted works as a search and returns results
2017-01-17 12:46:38	keveloper	most of those browsers were linux guys
2017-01-17 12:47:26	keveloper	okay tudelft is not a concern lol

2017-01-17 12:58:01	na_th_an	and now we're going to auto generate a schema instead?
2017-01-17 12:58:07	keveloper	wtf
2017-01-17 12:58:08	na_th_an	and rich was working on this and mark knew about it
2017-01-17 12:58:12	na_th_an	but I was still doing the schema manually
2017-01-17 12:58:17	na_th_an	per mark's instruction
2017-01-17 12:58:31	na_th_an	ok cool
2017-01-17 12:58:37	na_th_an	glad we spent over 3 days of dev time on this

2017-01-17 12:58:49	keveloper	did you see me little write up about jinbins thing
2017-01-17 12:59:48	na_th_an	no im not on the email remember
2017-01-17 13:00:33	keveloper	i sent you a crypto bin link
2017-01-17 13:00:36	keveloper	and the password to it
2017-01-17 13:05:23	keveloper	this is a lot of data to look at and make conclusions about
2017-01-17 13:11:40	keveloper	shit takes so long to load
2017-01-17 13:11:49	keveloper	this is a little late to investigate this
2017-01-17 13:12:03	keveloper	if i cant see what was happening from the 28th to the 1st
2017-01-17 13:13:10	keveloper	so jay said that 50% of searches had 0 results
2017-01-17 13:13:15	keveloper	and said that nothing was down
2017-01-17 13:13:15	keveloper	hmm
2017-01-17 13:57:52	keveloper	it was defitely a distributed attack
2017-01-17 14:28:01	na_th_an	you keep using the word attack
2017-01-17 14:28:10	na_th_an	but idk if that's right 
2017-01-17 14:28:12	keveloper	100%
2017-01-17 14:28:23	na_th_an	distributed botnet scraping bibliographic data from oclc? sure
2017-01-17 14:28:33	keveloper	maybe but is that not an attack
2017-01-17 14:28:41	na_th_an	no
2017-01-17 14:28:46	keveloper	they are stealing data
2017-01-17 14:28:48	na_th_an	it's definitely not a DDOS
2017-01-17 14:29:01	na_th_an	if they aren't denying service then it isn't a DDOS
2017-01-17 14:29:02	keveloper	i didn't say DDoS
2017-01-17 14:29:07	keveloper	and they were
2017-01-17 14:29:18	na_th_an	but anyway
2017-01-17 14:29:20	keveloper	Firefly was basically useless
2017-01-17 14:29:21	na_th_an	there was a bus
2017-01-17 14:29:23	na_th_an	a bus came
2017-01-17 14:29:25	na_th_an	and mark was in front
2017-01-17 14:29:28	na_th_an	I threw him under it
2017-01-17 14:29:33	keveloper	k
2017-01-17 14:29:53	na_th_an	rashmi asked if I thought he'd be effective in a defects-only role
2017-01-17 14:30:06	na_th_an	and she asked if I thought this project would go faster if it was just you and me
2017-01-17 14:30:25	keveloper	and
2017-01-17 14:31:14	na_th_an	take a guess how I answered
2017-01-17 14:37:52	keveloper	no and yes
2017-01-17 14:38:05	keveloper	brb going to talk to paul wingert
2017-01-17 14:39:00	na_th_an	correct
2017-01-17 14:58:56	na_th_an	this project would go so much better if mark was fired right this second
2017-01-17 14:59:07	na_th_an	I just can't believe how hard it is to get an aswer to "what should I be doing"
2017-01-17 14:59:15	na_th_an	when he's saying THERE'S SO MUCH WORK AND IT'S SO HARD
2017-01-17 14:59:27	na_th_an	"oh write the controller"
2017-01-17 14:59:48	na_th_an	well ok I'll just write the whole damn service then but you've been taking days on "builders" now
2017-01-17 15:12:18	na_th_an	still hasn't committed
2017-01-17 15:12:26	na_th_an	still figuring out how to push his domain object
2017-01-17 15:12:39	na_th_an	just muttered "okay, I think I have to turn on annotations..."

2017-01-17 15:19:29	na_th_an	you can just give it to me tomorrow and I can try it
2017-01-17 15:19:32	keveloper	true
2017-01-17 15:19:56	keveloper	shouldve brought it with me today
2017-01-17 15:20:06	na_th_an	30 minutes now I've been waiting for work
2017-01-17 15:20:12	keveloper	sounds liek snowflake
2017-01-17 15:20:26	na_th_an	after spending a day and a half on something that I guess doesn't matter
2017-01-17 15:22:50	keveloper	i hope i can write this doc in 90 minutes
2017-01-17 15:23:01	na_th_an	can i go home
2017-01-17 15:23:01	keveloper	botnet isn't a word in confluence
2017-01-17 15:27:49	na_th_an	being called a "coding wizkid" was extremely awkward and I really wish she hadn't done that
2017-01-17 15:29:28	keveloper	lolol
2017-01-17 15:29:30	keveloper	wizkid
2017-01-17 15:29:36	keveloper	im not a wizkid :(

2017-01-17 15:30:12	na_th_an	so feel good about that
2017-01-17 15:30:19	keveloper	idk how i havent done much lol
2017-01-17 15:30:26	na_th_an	because you were like
2017-01-17 15:30:29	na_th_an	"ya 2 or 3 days"
2017-01-17 15:30:31	na_th_an	where mark is like
2017-01-17 15:30:35	na_th_an	"okay. well."
2017-01-17 15:30:43	keveloper	i was actually like "way less than 3 days, maybe 1 idk"
2017-01-17 15:30:56	na_th_an	"gotta hook the DR into the DUI, that'll take some time, then idk how to push, that'll take a day or so...."
2017-01-17 15:46:43	na_th_an	ugh
2017-01-17 15:46:49	na_th_an	still has a broken build
2017-01-17 15:46:54	na_th_an	still hasn't pushed anything
2017-01-17 15:47:02	na_th_an	fucking kill me, this is hell
2017-01-17 15:47:05	na_th_an	this is truly hell
2017-01-17 15:49:23	keveloper	https://confluence.oclc.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=38223030
2017-01-17 15:49:36	keveloper	how is that also do you have any ideas for solutions
2017-01-17 15:50:13	na_th_an	you use the word "random" but it isn't random
2017-01-17 15:50:41	keveloper	well yeah
2017-01-17 15:50:45	keveloper	how should I say it
2017-01-17 15:50:48	keveloper	"distributed"
2017-01-17 15:51:00	na_th_an	multiple, many, distributed
2017-01-17 15:51:12	keveloper	fixed
2017-01-17 15:51:18	keveloper	i said distrubted IPs and multiple clients
2017-01-17 15:51:35	na_th_an	"I put the files, I have no idea where they went"
2017-01-17 15:51:49	keveloper	lol
2017-01-17 15:51:50	keveloper	he's so good
2017-01-17 15:52:17	na_th_an	> pull, see what branch changes were on
2017-01-17 15:52:26	na_th_an	"Did you push to the feature/domainObjects branch?"
2017-01-17 15:52:32	na_th_an	"I wasn't on any branch"
2017-01-17 15:53:14	na_th_an	nope nvm he didn't push
2017-01-17 15:55:22	na_th_an	you may have covered this, but we could detect if a session was being used by multiple IP addresses
2017-01-17 15:56:37	keveloper	yeah its in there
2017-01-17 15:56:43	keveloper	scroll passed the images
2017-01-17 15:56:48	keveloper	first detection solution
2017-01-17 15:56:49	na_th_an	i just skimmed it
2017-01-17 15:56:52	keveloper	oh
2017-01-17 15:56:53	na_th_an	cool
2017-01-17 15:57:11	keveloper	What if you are on your phone though and your IP changes
2017-01-17 15:57:12	keveloper	that happens right
2017-01-17 15:57:16	keveloper	You'll be blocked
2017-01-17 15:57:46	keveloper	Actually mine is a bit different, I'll add that
2017-01-17 15:57:53	na_th_an	that's what I thought
2017-01-17 15:57:55	na_th_an	which is why I asked
2017-01-17 15:58:24	na_th_an	idk if your phone IP changes as you hop between towers
2017-01-17 15:58:26	na_th_an	that's a good question
2017-01-17 15:58:38	na_th_an	but ya you'd probably want a "number of IP changes within a time frame" kind of thing
2017-01-17 15:59:55	keveloper	hey i just pretty much typed that exact sentence
2017-01-17 16:31:04	keveloper	https://confluence.oclc.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=38223030
2017-01-17 16:31:07	na_th_an	hi
2017-01-17 16:31:30	keveloper	i added anchors because good doc
2017-01-17 16:31:37	keveloper	also i changed stuff and added stuff to bottom
2017-01-17 16:31:51	na_th_an	it'd be nice if you could put a box around the picture and the figure line
2017-01-17 16:31:58	na_th_an	it's hard to tell which picture is fig 2
2017-01-17 16:32:11	na_th_an	but it's totally nbd
2017-01-17 16:32:19	na_th_an	just if you want it to be perfect
2017-01-17 16:33:15	na_th_an	rich is like
2017-01-17 16:33:31	na_th_an	"I've stood up services like this by myself in my free time, I don't understand what's so complicated"
2017-01-17 16:33:37	keveloper	done
2017-01-17 16:33:48	na_th_an	nice
2017-01-17 16:34:16	keveloper	no idea how to change border color
2017-01-17 16:36:50	na_th_an	this is so wrong
2017-01-17 16:37:01	na_th_an	mark's first and only commit
2017-01-17 16:37:03	na_th_an	is so wrong
2017-01-17 16:37:07	keveloper	link
2017-01-17 16:37:41	na_th_an	"now I'm getting code coverage errors"
2017-01-17 16:37:46	keveloper	i broke weechat
2017-01-17 16:37:46	keveloper	uh
2017-01-17 16:37:47	na_th_an	well yeah you broke the fucking build

2017-01-17 16:38:07	na_th_an	http://git.ent.oclc.org/projects/DISC/repos/discoverycite/commits/a24cb4eef6d06750e385d39435fddf72b7336913
2017-01-17 16:38:11	keveloper	k im back
2017-01-17 16:38:18	na_th_an	look at how groovy that builder is
2017-01-17 16:38:32	na_th_an	and check out the request objects
2017-01-17 16:38:51	keveloper	why is there a db list there
2017-01-17 16:38:57	na_th_an	that's a thing that easybib can use
2017-01-17 16:39:03	keveloper	ah oaky
2017-01-17 16:39:34	na_th_an	he definitely said we were going to use a different object for each material type but this code doesn't say that
2017-01-17 16:39:42	na_th_an	i just
2017-01-17 16:39:45	na_th_an	this is impossible
2017-01-17 16:40:25	na_th_an	i literally just don't know what to do
2017-01-17 16:40:29	na_th_an	to fix this mess
2017-01-17 16:40:41	na_th_an	without just telling mark to stop, leave, go home, and let me do this right
2017-01-17 16:42:13	keveloper	uh oh rashmi is typing in response to my doc
2017-01-17 16:42:16	keveloper	whats she gonna say
2017-01-17 16:45:01	keveloper	i feel accomplished
2017-01-17 16:45:04	keveloper	surprisingly
2017-01-17 16:45:14	keveloper	i wasn't expecting to feel accomplished after making this document
2017-01-18 07:57:21	keveloper	melissa said the chicken guy got fired
2017-01-18 07:58:48	keveloper	"why did you leave your previous company" "i got fired for stealing chicken from the cafeteria" lolol
2017-01-18 08:18:17	keveloper	"IP Misuse did not catch it because of it."
2017-01-18 08:18:20	keveloper	good sentence rashmi

2017-01-18 08:41:49	na_th_an	i wish it were mark
2017-01-18 08:42:03	na_th_an	his name should be on the recent departures if we don't hear about it
2017-01-18 08:42:06	na_th_an	we can guess
2017-01-18 08:42:17	na_th_an	we should have written chickenmisuse
2017-01-18 08:44:48	na_th_an	hi

2017-01-18 08:53:25	na_th_an	when rich and i talked alone yesterday he's like "this is when most projects start to get inertia"
2017-01-18 08:53:53	na_th_an	and he's like "I usually see pull requests"
2017-01-18 08:54:04	na_th_an	but mark's like "let's just develop on master"
2017-01-18 08:55:21	na_th_an	I feel like we need to fucking lock mark out of master
2017-01-18 08:55:24	na_th_an	ugh

2017-01-18 09:48:18	keveloper	and i can predict it
2017-01-18 09:48:19	na_th_an	wow mark saying mildly sexist things over here
2017-01-18 09:48:22	keveloper	and i can meet the ball where i want
2017-01-18 09:48:25	keveloper	and make it go where i want
2017-01-18 09:48:31	keveloper	in the air or anywhere
2017-01-18 09:48:35	keveloper	and everytime im like ahhhhhh
2017-01-18 09:48:40	keveloper	what is he saying
2017-01-18 09:48:43	na_th_an	i was talking about the girl who made the nes with zach and mark's like
2017-01-18 09:48:49	na_th_an	"I bet she was pretty good lookin' too"
2017-01-18 09:48:57	keveloper	literally wat
2017-01-18 09:49:00	na_th_an	and I'm like "yeah... some of em..." really uncomfortably
2017-01-18 09:49:03	na_th_an	and zach's like
2017-01-18 09:49:12	na_th_an	"The ones that were trying to recruit you anyway"
2017-01-18 09:49:17	keveloper	true
2017-01-18 09:49:21	keveloper	tek systems lol
2017-01-18 09:49:27	na_th_an	and mark says "and I've bet they've never programmed a thing in their life" 
2017-01-18 09:49:35	keveloper	probably not correct mark
2017-01-18 09:49:39	keveloper	they are recruiters
2017-01-18 09:49:41	keveloper	very good mark

2017-01-18 11:20:51	na_th_an	and he said rashmi was asking him what he thought about mark
2017-01-18 11:21:10	na_th_an	and he's like "obviously I think you're a much better coder but I didn't wanna be like 'hey fuck you guy' 12 days after I join the team"
2017-01-18 11:21:16	na_th_an	and he made some big midddle finger gesture

2017-01-19 08:37:47	keveloper	im back in business
2017-01-19 08:37:52	keveloper	how it should be imo
2017-01-19 08:37:52	na_th_an	do you think that should be an integer or a string
2017-01-19 08:38:06	keveloper	uh
2017-01-19 08:38:12	keveloper	int
2017-01-19 08:38:17	keveloper	no 06 shit

2017-01-19 08:38:37	na_th_an	well mark doesn't!
2017-01-19 08:38:50	keveloper	what
2017-01-19 08:38:51	keveloper	why
2017-01-19 08:38:55	keveloper	does he have a reason
2017-01-19 08:39:01	keveloper	what does he want the strings to be
2017-01-19 08:39:04	keveloper	"6"?
2017-01-19 08:39:08	keveloper	"06"?
2017-01-19 08:39:10	keveloper	"June"?
2017-01-19 08:39:19	na_th_an	ya I guess
2017-01-19 08:39:26	keveloper	"June", "Sixth", "Twenty-sixteen"
2017-01-19 08:39:29	na_th_an	it looks like easybib takes them as strings in their examples
2017-01-19 08:39:33	na_th_an	so it's not a big deal
2017-01-19 08:39:40	keveloper	as what "6"?
2017-01-19 08:39:52	keveloper	I mean its JSON its not a big deal
2017-01-19 08:39:54	keveloper	6 is "6"
2017-01-19 08:40:02	na_th_an	he's like "I think that it is a bad idea to assume integers or conversions for what is coming in. We should stick to strings and let the data be what it is."
2017-01-19 08:40:06	na_th_an	OMG HE STILL HAS CODENARC ISSUES
2017-01-19 08:40:08	na_th_an	WHAT THE FUCK

2017-01-19 11:08:58	keveloper	its been so long since ive done this
2017-01-19 11:09:01	na_th_an	lol
2017-01-19 11:09:26	na_th_an	i think rashmi might be putting mark into a non-coding role for this project
2017-01-19 11:09:45	na_th_an	this is so awkward
2017-01-19 11:12:52	keveloper	why do you think that
2017-01-19 11:14:46	na_th_an	she asked me specifically about his role as a coder in this project
2017-01-19 11:14:55	na_th_an	and if i thought it would help, hurt, or do nothing
2017-01-19 11:15:09	keveloper	yeah this is all just really awkward
2017-01-19 11:15:38	na_th_an	yeah i really don't like this position I'm being put in
2017-01-19 11:15:44	na_th_an	it's very uncomfortable
2017-01-19 11:20:04	na_th_an	rashmi just came back and i don't see mark
2017-01-19 11:27:16	na_th_an	i really wanna know what they

2017-01-19 13:30:30	keveloper	so she got a refund and bought a kindle
2017-01-19 13:36:47	na_th_an	lol
2017-01-19 13:42:06	na_th_an	I think mark thought I would try to protect him from rashmi because we both don't like her
2017-01-19 13:42:17	na_th_an	I think he thought I would try to cover for him
2017-01-19 13:42:22	keveloper	lol
2017-01-19 13:42:24	keveloper	why do you think that
2017-01-19 13:42:32	na_th_an	idk just some of the comments he's said about her when she's not around
2017-01-19 13:42:44	na_th_an	it's all rashmi's fault
2017-01-19 13:42:54	na_th_an	it's not that he's incompetant, she just has unreasonable expectations
2017-01-19 13:42:56	keveloper	eh if it makes him feel better he can think that
2017-01-19 13:43:04	na_th_an	i mean ya

2017-01-19 13:44:28	na_th_an	you could have a private map
2017-01-19 13:44:29	keveloper	thatd be cool
2017-01-19 14:22:07	na_th_an	mark was like "I thought I was being helpful by telling people to do whatever they wanted"

2017-01-23 10:02:03	na_th_an	4) start it up
2017-01-23 10:02:04	keveloper	lol
2017-01-23 10:02:15	keveloper	can we just make it start on start up
2017-01-23 10:02:16	keveloper	is that possible
2017-01-23 10:02:17	na_th_an	you can nohup it
2017-01-23 10:02:33	keveloper	thats not gonna help with start up lol
2017-01-23 10:02:39	keveloper	does that machine ever get restarted
2017-01-23 10:02:39	na_th_an	ya i'm sure it is but then you have to document it because nobody else knows how that'll work
2017-01-23 10:02:46	keveloper	it has screen doesnt it
2017-01-23 10:02:49	na_th_an	i didn't respond to your "we can make it start on startup" intwo seconds
2017-01-23 10:02:51	keveloper	i just put it in a screen session and detach
2017-01-23 10:02:53	na_th_an	it gets restarted sometimes
2017-01-23 10:02:55	keveloper	unless i am misunderstanding screen
2017-01-23 10:02:59	na_th_an	you can do screen but nobody else knows how to do that
2017-01-23 10:03:02	na_th_an	besides you and me
2017-01-23 10:03:08	keveloper	-_-
2017-01-23 10:03:11	na_th_an	yup
2017-01-23 10:03:18	na_th_an	so i usually just nohup it
2017-01-23 10:03:52	keveloper	i dont even know how to use nohup
2017-01-23 10:04:46	na_th_an	nohup <command>
2017-01-23 10:04:54	na_th_an	it blocks the hup signal
2017-01-23 10:05:04	na_th_an	which is the signal that's broadcast when you logout
2017-01-23 10:05:13	na_th_an	and says "this user is gone, shut shit down"
2017-01-23 10:05:18	na_th_an	nohup is like "no thx man"!
2017-01-23 10:05:22	na_th_an	and just keeps going
2017-01-23 10:08:19	keveloper	wow nice

2017-01-23 10:09:05	keveloper	4040?
2017-01-23 10:09:08	na_th_an	4040 i think
2017-01-23 10:09:13	na_th_an	that's what bash history is for
2017-01-23 10:09:26	na_th_an	i'd lose at least 20% of my productivity if all of my bash histor were wiped
2017-01-23 10:10:07	keveloper	do you know if something runs on 80
2017-01-23 10:10:14	keveloper	why is that in the rotation

2017-01-23 10:21:41	na_th_an	i don't think so but it's possible
2017-01-23 10:21:58	keveloper	I looked up how to do it and the internet was like "Use screen"
2017-01-23 10:22:16	keveloper	literally when you google "start process with nohup" its like "1. Use Screen."
2017-01-23 10:22:53	keveloper	screen -i -m command
2017-01-23 10:22:59	na_th_an	i'm not arguing
2017-01-23 10:23:00	keveloper	runs the command and detaches

2017-01-24 10:00:16	keveloper	rashmi told her to

2017-01-24 10:00:34	keveloper	"nathan was the last person to do something like this so go ask him"

2017-01-24 10:20:07	keveloper	i had some of the funnest RL ever last night
2017-01-24 10:20:09	keveloper	it was great
2017-01-24 10:20:17	keveloper	emily was playing age of empires on my computer
2017-01-24 10:20:24	keveloper	so i did splitscreen on two monitors with quinton
2017-01-24 10:20:48	keveloper	they wanted to do ranked
2017-01-24 10:20:51	keveloper	and iwas like okay w/e
2017-01-24 10:20:57	keveloper	so it was like unintentional smurfing
2017-01-24 10:20:59	keveloper	it was funny
2017-01-24 10:21:09	keveloper	i was trying to freestyle literally every single aerial
2017-01-24 10:22:10	na_th_an	lol
2017-01-24 10:22:21	na_th_an	i thought it was weird that you were playing age of empires instead of RL
2017-01-24 10:23:03	keveloper	it is so hard to steer in the air while freestyling
2017-01-24 10:23:06	keveloper	literally impossible
2017-01-24 10:45:10	keveloper	does DUI have to open a firewall hole for all of our xml namespace shit or are those only for development
2017-01-24 10:45:22	na_th_an	idk
2017-01-24 10:45:50	na_th_an	do you remember where builds go
2017-01-24 10:45:54	na_th_an	self servic ebuilds
2017-01-24 10:46:44	keveloper	uh
2017-01-24 10:46:46	keveloper	squaw
2017-01-24 10:46:53	keveloper	/sq/quality/ini/builds
2017-01-24 10:46:54	na_th_an	ya i know that much
2017-01-24 10:46:55	keveloper	or something
2017-01-24 10:46:56	keveloper	idk
2017-01-24 10:47:05	keveloper	svn might be int here somewhere
2017-01-24 10:47:22	na_th_an	you're useless tome
2017-01-24 10:48:10	keveloper	rip
2017-01-24 10:49:12	keveloper	like does DUI make a request to http://www.springframework.org/
2017-01-24 10:49:15	keveloper	that doesnt make sense
2017-01-24 10:49:17	keveloper	no it does not
2017-01-24 10:49:25	na_th_an	i think jeff knows about this shit
2017-01-24 10:49:41	keveloper	I don't think it does that doesn't sound like it makes sense
2017-01-24 10:49:46	keveloper	I think the namespace stuff is for development
2017-01-24 10:49:54	keveloper	Wouldn't it just be packed with spring
2017-01-24 10:50:03	na_th_an	i think that's the problem
2017-01-24 10:50:13	na_th_an	is if you refer to a version that isn't in the jars you have packed
2017-01-24 10:50:23	na_th_an	but there's no reason to ask me about this
2017-01-24 10:50:26	na_th_an	because I don't know about it
2017-01-24 10:50:29	keveloper	lol
2017-01-24 10:50:32	keveloper	ur savage man
2017-01-24 10:51:57	keveloper	yeah spring looks for the schemas in the classpath first
2017-01-24 10:52:17	na_th_an	yeah and iirc from jeff's ranting
2017-01-24 10:52:27	na_th_an	if you don't have a version on it, then it'll use whatever is in the classpath
2017-01-24 10:52:35	keveloper	yeah
2017-01-24 10:53:06	keveloper	or if you specify the version that is in the classpath its fine too
2017-01-24 14:03:49	keveloper	they dont run live integration in dev?
2017-01-24 14:05:18	na_th_an	"we" as in QA
2017-01-24 14:05:39	na_th_an	"we" (as in developers) are supposed to be owning the live integration tests in dev
2017-01-24 14:06:00	keveloper	oh
2017-01-24 14:06:18	na_th_an	qa is not supposed to tap us on the shoulder and say "live integration is broken in dev"
2017-01-24 16:11:01	na_th_an	lololololol
2017-01-24 16:11:03	na_th_an	"A powerful web development nanoframework so small it's not even a microframework.
2017-01-24 16:11:09	na_th_an	gothalice's python framework
2017-01-24 16:24:09	na_th_an	rick padro's voice is v distracting
2017-01-24 16:30:12	keveloper	tru
2017-01-25 13:19:05	keveloper	our install processes are so fucked
2017-01-25 13:20:14	na_th_an	yes
2017-01-25 13:20:22	na_th_an	and we don't seem to be changing them
2017-01-25 13:20:25	na_th_an	at least fast enough
2017-01-25 13:20:32	na_th_an	you should have seen what it was like before ubiquity
2017-01-25 13:21:07	keveloper	i really really wish that is was just
2017-01-25 13:21:14	keveloper	feature is ENTIRELY done, like production ready
2017-01-25 13:21:17	keveloper	merge that to master
2017-01-25 13:21:33	keveloper	release right there
2017-01-25 13:21:41	na_th_an	well a lot of places are doing this thing called CI
2017-01-25 13:21:57	na_th_an	where it'd just get pushed up the chain as long as our tests pass
2017-01-25 13:22:17	keveloper	yeah it should merge, CI, release
2017-01-25 13:22:29	keveloper	then QA will do rv on it in NIT
2017-01-25 13:22:35	na_th_an	the release shouldn't even be a manual process
2017-01-25 13:22:36	keveloper	then we install to NAT/PROD like 2 hours later
2017-01-25 13:22:41	keveloper	true
2017-01-25 13:22:45	keveloper	true
2017-01-25 13:22:48	keveloper	if its been merged
2017-01-25 16:41:58	na_th_an	i wonder if rick padro has always talked like that
2017-01-25 16:42:07	na_th_an	or if something happened and his voice changed
2017-01-25 16:42:27	keveloper	ask
2017-01-25 16:44:15	na_th_an	oh ya ok
2017-01-26 09:30:38	keveloper	i feel like goth alice is like an ancient legend
2017-01-26 09:30:40	keveloper	who doesn't really talk
2017-01-26 09:30:47	keveloper	but always makes an entrance when she does
2017-01-26 09:30:52	na_th_an	she's like an overseer in starcraft
2017-01-26 09:31:00	keveloper	and she like walks in and thrusts or staff down and big shock wake goes out
2017-01-26 09:31:03	keveloper	and shes like
2017-01-26 09:31:11	keveloper	"THE WORD ZNC SHALL NOT BE UTTERED IN MY LAND"
2017-01-26 09:31:25	keveloper	and like an eneregy torando surrounds everybody and there's like lightning
2017-01-26 09:31:36	keveloper	and everybody's hair is like blowing in the wind
2017-01-26 09:31:41	keveloper	and its really loud
2017-01-26 09:32:45	na_th_an	I picture gothalice masturbating right now
2017-01-26 09:32:50	na_th_an	"ahhhh purity yesss"
2017-01-26 09:33:22	keveloper	lol

2017-01-26 09:33:59	na_th_an	she's like, masturbating to the purity of her znc setup
2017-01-26 09:34:14	keveloper	oh im missing standup

2017-01-26 14:19:39	keveloper	did he switch away
2017-01-26 14:19:44	keveloper	or did you see it
2017-01-26 14:19:48	keveloper	was it actually about a new job
2017-01-26 14:19:51	na_th_an	he didn't switch away
2017-01-26 14:19:57	na_th_an	but he didn't know I was there either
2017-01-26 14:19:59	keveloper	did he zoom in really big on the subject fo royu
2017-01-26 14:20:00	keveloper	oh
2017-01-26 14:20:03	na_th_an	it was probably not actually about new job
2017-01-26 14:20:15	keveloper	i walked up to abby and she quickly flipped her phone over
2017-01-26 14:20:31	na_th_an	she's texting some dude in hangouts I saw
2017-01-26 14:20:37	keveloper	"o

2017-01-27 10:54:27	keveloper	do you think you would get fired if you walked up to the balcony and threw up off of it
2017-01-27 10:54:34	na_th_an	yes
2017-01-27 10:54:37	keveloper	lol
2017-01-27 10:54:46	keveloper	does it depend on how intentional it looks
2017-01-27 10:55:03	na_th_an	I think you'd need to be hospitalized after in order to not get fired
2017-01-27 10:55:20	keveloper	what if i was standing there for like 12 minutes
2017-01-27 10:55:21	keveloper	then just threw up
2017-01-27 10:55:23	keveloper	and ran away
2017-01-27 10:55:25	keveloper	to the bathroom
2017-01-27 10:55:33	na_th_an	idk man
2017-01-27 10:55:36	na_th_an	use the ask hr form
2017-01-27 10:55:51	keveloper	lol
2017-01-27 10:56:00	na_th_an	hey I wrote that summary
2017-01-27 10:56:06	na_th_an	the initial implementation anyway
2017-01-27 11:20:57	na_th_an	oclc has to stage a fake meeting to make it look like a girl is talking about code in a meeting
2017-01-27 11:21:52	keveloper	lol
2017-01-27 13:16:18	na_th_an	zach just pm'd me asking if it'd be possible to make DEV things talk to NIT
2017-01-27 13:16:42	na_th_an	so that, for example, if DR DEV is having issues then DUI DEV still works
2017-01-27 13:16:57	na_th_an	and then if we want to test DUI and DR in DEV then we change the DEV DUI URL for DR
2017-01-27 13:17:08	na_th_an	and I told him this would not work because of wskey tokens
2017-01-27 13:17:15	na_th_an	I assume you agree that that would not work very well
2017-01-27 13:17:21	na_th_an	but the reason for this question
2017-01-27 13:17:29	na_th_an	is because SOMEBODY merged untested changes into DR
2017-01-27 13:17:49	na_th_an	who on the team would merge untested changes into master DR and break CI
2017-01-27 13:18:36	keveloper	sorry i just saw all this
2017-01-27 13:18:37	keveloper	oh
2017-01-27 13:18:39	keveloper	this is current
2017-01-27 13:19:06	keveloper	it wouldn't work because WSKey tokens but more importantly firewalls
2017-01-27 13:19:16	keveloper	DEV can't talk to NIT or NAT
2017-01-27 13:19:32	keveloper	there is no interenvironment communication allowed
2017-01-27 13:20:21	na_th_an	I thought that rule was only for NAT
2017-01-27 13:20:27	na_th_an	I mean I know it's not *supposed* to happen
2017-01-27 13:20:29	keveloper	idk
2017-01-27 13:20:36	keveloper	i dont think we should do that
2017-01-27 13:20:36	na_th_an	but ya I said that I think firewall would block you
2017-01-27 13:20:43	na_th_an	but even if it didn't it's still a bad idea
2017-01-27 13:22:13	keveloper	all CI is green righ tnow
2017-01-27 13:22:58	na_th_an	nice
2017-01-27 13:23:01	na_th_an	even tests?

2017-01-30 13:59:21	na_th_an	The drop has a shipping date of February. That's really pessimistic and is designed to compensate for two big things working against us. One, that it's the Christmas season and shipping is slow for everyone. Two, that this is the first time we're working with this manufacturer.
2017-01-30 13:59:47	na_th_an	seems like things are a little late #bigsurprise

2017-01-30 14:21:47	keveloper	he's talking about some very specific find thing rashmi doesnt need to know about
2017-01-30 14:21:48	na_th_an	"we need to drill down"
2017-01-30 14:21:57	na_th_an	rashmi needs to know about everything
2017-01-30 14:22:12	keveloper	she's asking about how our alerting system works now
2017-01-30 14:23:05	na_th_an	she's letting other teams know about how awful she is
2017-01-30 14:24:15	keveloper	lol
2017-01-30 14:24:32	keveloper	she was asking if they could do 90th percentile instead of avg

2017-01-30 14:25:54	keveloper	10% of all find searches are health checks
2017-01-30 14:26:41	keveloper	rashmi is recommending what they should do
2017-01-30 14:26:47	keveloper	i hate her
2017-01-30 14:26:50	keveloper	she is so awful
2017-01-30 14:27:01	keveloper	paul is looking at her like "..."
2017-01-30 14:27:31	keveloper	it sounds like find needs to do more caching from what amin is saying
2017-01-30 14:27:34	keveloper	but i aint gonna say that
2017-01-30 14:27:39	keveloper	maybe rashmi will

2017-01-30 14:28:59	keveloper	lolol
2017-01-30 14:29:11	na_th_an	I've noticed that she does this thing where she raises her hand and waves at you
2017-01-30 14:29:36	na_th_an	when she wants to talk about estimates she'll go "Nathan!" with a super fake smile and raise her hand and then gesture for me to come over
2017-01-30 14:29:46	na_th_an	it makes me feel like a dog being summoned

2017-01-30 14:36:16	keveloper	lol what is pjax
2017-01-30 14:37:32	na_th_an	push state + ajax
2017-01-30 14:37:39	na_th_an	so like imagine you open the citations dialog
2017-01-30 14:37:49	na_th_an	it would do ajax to get the content of the dialog
2017-01-30 14:37:59	na_th_an	then use pushstate to say "this is a new page" 
2017-01-30 14:38:08	na_th_an	so if you press "back" then the dialog foes away
2017-01-30 14:38:18	keveloper	how do you get the firefly request from a request id
2017-01-30 14:38:22	na_th_an	but jb decided to take a buzzword and do it totally wrong

2017-02-15 08:49:16	na_th_an	I think maybe even some microsoft code did
2017-02-15 08:49:27	keveloper	lool
2017-02-15 08:49:34	na_th_an	I think it's true that it was a major reason 
2017-02-15 09:37:52	keveloper	i think bryan explained something about ols domain pretty incorrectly to me and i dont wanna go over and be like "so all of what you said seems to be not how it actually is so what we talked about wont work"

2017-02-15 09:42:37	keveloper	which is fine but idk where the source of the data is

2017-02-16 09:23:07	keveloper	never forget that he's 32
2017-02-16 09:23:14	na_th_an	I thought he was 30
2017-02-16 09:23:20	na_th_an	gd
2017-02-16 09:23:21	keveloper	he could have a 10 year old kid
2017-02-16 09:23:25	keveloper	it was 31 or 32 idr
2017-02-16 09:23:44	na_th_an	31 i think

2017-02-16 09:23:55	keveloper	still he could have a 10 year old kid

2017-02-16 09:24:28	na_th_an	a 32 year old shouldn't be talking to a person in their 20s on reddit and be like "yeah this is a relationship this is normal"
2017-02-16 09:25:03	keveloper	i mean im sure they didn't find out each other's ages insantly
2017-02-16 09:25:38	na_th_an	true
2017-02-16 09:25:43	keveloper	i wonder if they will ever meet
2017-02-16 09:27:49	keveloper	what do you think his uh
2017-02-16 09:27:54	keveloper	body size is

2017-02-16 09:30:17	keveloper	do you thin khe is also
2017-02-16 09:30:39	na_th_an	i don't think he's the skinny kind of nerdy
2017-02-16 09:44:08	na_th_an	how much you wanna bet that michael makes more than us because he signed later and they're like "oh starting salary is higher now"
2017-02-16 09:44:19	na_th_an	I just kinda assume that's the case based on my experiences here
2017-02-16 09:44:37	keveloper	eh
2017-02-16 09:44:47	keveloper	idk if base salary changes that much every year
2017-02-16 09:45:17	na_th_an	it *probably* doesn't
2017-02-16 09:45:29	keveloper	im gonna make a module for course item notes and im gonna follow your state/update idea
2017-02-16 09:45:29	na_th_an	but based on past experience I just assume I'm getting shafted
2017-02-16 09:45:38	na_th_an	do it, it's great
2017-02-16 09:45:51	keveloper	because right now its just "make it work" jquery blob
2017-02-16 09:45:53	keveloper	its great
2017-02-16 09:46:03	na_th_an	we have some really awful jquery
2017-02-16 09:46:05	keveloper	hold on lemme send it to you
2017-02-16 09:46:17	na_th_an	ying is really good at making some bad jquery that works but is completely indecipherable
2017-02-16 09:46:22	keveloper	http://pastebin.com/vLvtc6uq
2017-02-16 09:46:25	keveloper	there we go thats it right now

2017-02-16 09:49:33	keveloper	loool
2017-02-16 09:55:44	na_th_an	i mean, it was written before you could do it a cleaner way
2017-02-16 09:55:46	na_th_an	with like annotations
2017-02-16 09:55:57	na_th_an	I guess they could have used spring to make a list to iterate through or something
2017-02-16 09:56:01	na_th_an	maybe
2017-02-16 09:56:08	na_th_an	DS was written before spring 2 was out
2017-02-16 10:00:49	keveloper	i was leaning against the window and now my arm is cold
2017-02-16 10:00:59	na_th_an	rip

2017-02-16 10:04:01	keveloper	what is framework/storage
2017-02-16 10:04:14	na_th_an	I assume a wrapper over javascript localstorage
2017-02-16 10:04:23	na_th_an	which is like, one method so idk why we need a wrapper but ok
2017-02-16 10:11:18	keveloper	hmm where do you set the state
2017-02-16 10:11:25	keveloper	like on inti

2017-02-16 10:36:44	na_th_an	what do you have to tell me plz
2017-02-16 10:36:51	keveloper	oh
2017-02-16 10:37:00	keveloper	for WCILR SOC didn't do health checks
2017-02-16 10:37:02	keveloper	we did
2017-02-16 10:37:09	keveloper	so SOC came up to watch jinbin do the health checks
2017-02-16 10:37:19	keveloper	to make sure they worked
2017-02-16 10:37:26	na_th_an	wat
2017-02-16 10:37:29	keveloper	lol
2017-02-16 10:37:36	keveloper	jinbin and bill were just talking about it
2017-02-16 10:39:27	keveloper	my only jquery selectors are in an initElements method \o/
2017-02-16 10:46:25	keveloper	ohhh idk how to do this uhhh
2017-02-16 10:46:44	keveloper	so i need multiple instances of the course item note module
2017-02-16 10:47:01	keveloper	and i just tried to instantiate one for each bib record
2017-02-16 10:47:28	keveloper	it kind of worked
2017-02-16 10:47:30	na_th_an	sounds like exactly what the citition dialog does
2017-02-16 10:47:37	keveloper	well no
2017-02-16 10:47:44	keveloper	there are as many forms as records for this
2017-02-16 10:47:48	keveloper	not one dialog
2017-02-16 10:56:29	keveloper	there's also Class.extend whatever that is
2017-02-16 11:13:20	keveloper	ayy i fixed it
2017-02-16 11:14:35	keveloper	this is cool
2017-02-16 11:20:27	keveloper	i like this
2017-02-16 11:20:31	keveloper	this is making this not disgusting
2017-02-16 11:20:41	na_th_an	the state variable or
2017-02-16 11:20:53	keveloper	just how im writing the module
2017-02-16 11:21:01	keveloper	state included
2017-02-16 11:21:03	na_th_an	yeah I liked that citations dialog
2017-02-16 11:21:09	na_th_an	it was the best jquery I've written for sure
2017-02-16 11:22:14	keveloper	"Danger, criminals live in your area! We recommend you select a different location to build a family." wtf lol
2017-02-16 11:22:17	keveloper	in the coreui styleguide
2017-02-16 11:23:26	na_th_an	that sounds like it could be from a game
2017-02-16 13:01:56	keveloper	this is cool now im just changing the state and calling self.updateView()
2017-02-16 13:02:15	na_th_an	yup
2017-02-16 13:02:17	na_th_an	it's much better
2017-02-16 13:02:33	keveloper	your update method will be a bit cleaner than mine tho
2017-02-16 13:33:07	keveloper	this is coool
2017-02-16 13:33:10	keveloper	i like
2017-02-16 13:33:10	keveloper	++
2017-02-16 13:34:48	na_th_an	innovation like this comes from working on side projects :)
2017-02-16 13:41:25	keveloper	it would be cool if the view would automatically update
2017-02-16 13:41:28	keveloper	when values change
2017-02-16 13:43:58	na_th_an	it would, but that's getting dangerously close to "just use a framework"
2017-02-16 13:44:13	na_th_an	see brandon zeeb would think that
2017-02-16 13:44:16	na_th_an	and then do it over the weekend
2017-02-16 13:44:22	na_th_an	and have something that polls in the background
2017-02-16 13:44:26	na_th_an	and he's like "so cool, right?"
2017-02-16 13:44:36	na_th_an	but then it causes issues and they have to go fix those issues
2017-02-16 13:44:40	na_th_an	and it's hard to maintain
2017-02-16 13:44:48	na_th_an	and brandon just thinks everyone else is too dumb for his code
2017-02-16 13:46:50	keveloper	im writing pre conditions is the too advanced
2017-02-16 13:46:54	keveloper	lol
2017-02-16 13:50:51	keveloper	ayy this is amazing this state thing
2017-02-16 13:50:55	keveloper	i wanna come show you what i did
2017-02-16 13:51:10	na_th_an	ok
2017-02-17 08:48:47	keveloper	... my module logic is all broken...
2017-02-17 08:48:53	keveloper	but i didnt change anything
2017-02-17 08:48:55	keveloper	its literally how i left it
2017-02-17 08:49:11	na_th_an	is it 'this'
2017-02-17 08:49:26	keveloper	no i changed that back to how it was
2017-02-17 08:49:41	keveloper	no errors in the console
2017-02-17 08:49:44	na_th_an	did you try the "no bugs please" command
2017-02-17 08:49:54	keveloper	the module isnt being loaded
2017-02-17 08:49:56	keveloper	like at all
2017-02-17 08:50:07	keveloper	its not in the source
2017-02-17 08:50:14	keveloper	in chrome dev tools
2017-02-17 08:50:16	na_th_an	that's probably an issue
2017-02-17 08:50:20	keveloper	wtf
2017-02-17 08:50:20	keveloper	wtf
2017-02-17 08:50:27	na_th_an	lol

2017-02-17 09:12:27	na_th_an	word
2017-02-17 09:12:51	keveloper	so you can read it like, the note title is hidden if editing note or note is empty
2017-02-17 09:12:55	keveloper	it reads nicely
2017-02-17 09:18:42	keveloper	my controller method is one line lol
2017-02-17 09:18:46	keveloper	courseServiceESL.editCourseItemNotes(courseId, itemId, notes, institution.registryId)
2017-02-17 09:18:51	keveloper	*nice*
2017-02-17 09:18:53	na_th_an	defect: nope
2017-02-17 09:19:07	na_th_an	can't have an controller call an ESL
2017-02-17 09:19:13	na_th_an	(I don't actually care. I'm channeling Jeff)
2017-02-17 09:19:25	keveloper	was that really a rule because we do this everywhere
2017-02-17 09:19:58	na_th_an	controller -> service -> esl -> sal
2017-02-17 09:20:00	keveloper	also the esl was already wired in the controller lol
2017-02-17 09:20:11	na_th_an	jeff would be like "create a service even if it does nothing"
2017-02-17 09:20:25	keveloper	i feel like sometimes we dont need all 4 layers
2017-02-17 09:20:27	na_th_an	"refactor everything even if it takes 3 days and won't even go into production"
2017-02-17 09:20:29	na_th_an	we don't
2017-02-17 09:20:40	na_th_an	we had stupid rules because of all the developers doing stuff badly
2017-02-17 09:23:03	keveloper	@param institution Institution object of the institution that owns the course
2017-02-17 09:23:05	keveloper	w/e idc
2017-02-17 09:23:32	na_th_an	@param institution reduntant explanation of self-explanatory variable
2017-02-17 09:23:40	keveloper	lol
2017-02-17 09:24:28	keveloper	its better than this one
2017-02-17 09:24:28	keveloper	@param institution The institution object
2017-02-17 09:24:55	keveloper	hany wrote that peice of goold

2017-02-17 09:25:13	na_th_an	I've written shit like that before
2017-02-17 09:25:23	na_th_an	because rules that other people set up
2017-02-17 09:25:25	keveloper	institution the Institution object
2017-02-17 09:25:36	na_th_an	object de institution
2017-02-17 09:25:39	keveloper	that sounds like a movie
2017-02-17 09:25:45	keveloper	"The Institution Object"
2017-02-17 09:25:48	keveloper	or a book
2017-02-17 09:25:52	na_th_an	ur a book
2017-02-17 09:25:54	keveloper	like a spy book
2017-02-17 09:25:55	keveloper	:o
2017-02-17 09:25:58	keveloper	(つ◕_◕ )つ(つ◕_◕ )つ(つ◕_◕ )つ
2017-02-17 09:26:50	keveloper	i should probably put all this shit in a new soy template
2017-02-17 09:27:24	na_th_an	ur a soy template
2017-02-17 09:27:31	keveloper	oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooook
2017-02-17 10:56:59	keveloper	i had to go back and make a change to this state thing and it was very easy
2017-02-17 10:59:44	na_th_an	:) yeah it really helps make things clear
2017-02-17 11:00:16	keveloper	i had to add a field length alert thing and it took like 2 seconds
2017-02-20 09:11:52	na_th_an	mark went on a date last weekend
2017-02-20 09:12:45	keveloper	how do you know this
2017-02-20 09:12:49	keveloper	do you know anymore
2017-02-20 09:13:48	na_th_an	when he came in bill and bridget were like "saw that pic of you on facebook" 
2017-02-20 09:14:00	na_th_an	and were like "you looked pretty good"
2017-02-20 09:14:08	na_th_an	he's like "my first date in years and you guys are giving me shit about it"
2017-02-20 09:14:45	na_th_an	I'm trying to fix dui's js shit
2017-02-20 09:14:50	na_th_an	in the free moments I have
2017-02-20 09:15:22	na_th_an	I ripped out all of the JS minifying and bundling shit and am trying to figure out how all of it works 
2017-02-20 09:17:29	keveloper	bill said long story short
2017-02-20 09:17:42	na_th_an	apparently there was also some big issue with the sybase install fucking our shit up
2017-02-20 09:17:48	na_th_an	but idgaf
2017-02-20 09:17:54	keveloper	then he said "i got called at 5:30 am"
2017-02-20 09:17:58	keveloper	and is still talking
2017-02-20 09:18:02	keveloper	after he said long story short
2017-02-20 09:18:12	keveloper	like almost a full minute ago
2017-02-20 09:18:22	keveloper	k a full minute now
2017-02-20 09:18:25	na_th_an	I can hear him too
2017-02-20 09:18:28	na_th_an	chill
2017-02-20 09:18:31	na_th_an	maybe the story is long and this is the short version
2017-02-20 09:18:39	keveloper	cant be that long
2017-02-20 09:20:54	na_th_an	it looks like we have this all-jquery-2.min.js file that has all our JS minified and combined
2017-02-20 09:21:07	na_th_an	but then we also read the individual modules too
2017-02-20 09:26:16	keveloper	ya
2017-02-20 09:26:22	keveloper	i noticed that friday
2017-02-20 09:26:35	na_th_an	actually it might just be that only some of our modules are minified 
2017-02-20 09:26:44	na_th_an	there are some client side soys that aren't minified
2017-02-20 09:26:48	na_th_an	the cover art load directive isn't minified
2017-02-20 09:26:54	na_th_an	and pages aren't minified
2017-02-20 09:26:58	na_th_an	but all the modules are combined and minified
2017-02-20 09:27:07	keveloper	i think it has to do with how its used
2017-02-20 09:27:13	keveloper	idk
2017-02-20 09:27:20	na_th_an	everything that's a require module is put into the bundle
2017-02-20 11:09:11	na_th_an	omg garry shurgin just called his wife

2017-02-21 15:19:37	na_th_an	yeah if she isn't looking for a dev position rn then I don't think she's ever going to
2017-02-21 15:19:45	na_th_an	especially since she doesn't do any dev on the side
2017-02-21 15:19:51	na_th_an	rip

2017-02-22 09:06:13	na_th_an	then there's a site where you send that layout and it generates cad files for the plate and case, and files for the pcb if you want one
2017-02-22 09:06:25	keveloper	or is that what this is
2017-02-22 09:06:32	na_th_an	I'm going to talk to her about what she wants to do

2017-02-22 22:31:39	na_th_an	if we need code reviews when we add a pojo to a field idk
2017-02-22 22:31:49	na_th_an	especially since I talked to brian about the design
2017-02-22 22:32:05	na_th_an	sometimes I think it's okay to take these liberties for the sake of speed
2017-02-22 22:32:21	na_th_an	because at some point we need to realize we're professionals that need to be competant at our jobs
2017-02-22 22:35:37	keveloper	yeah i already had a design meeeting for it so
2017-02-22 22:35:39	keveloper	and i showed them the code
2017-02-24 08:36:32	na_th_an	ux is kinda bad
2017-02-24 08:36:42	na_th_an	she's like "I assume you have ARIA labels"
2017-02-24 08:36:50	na_th_an	and like, I know what they are, but I've never been trained on them
2017-02-24 08:36:57	na_th_an	or seen any kind of guidelines for using them here
2017-02-24 08:37:05	na_th_an	so I'm like "can you be more specific on what you want?"
2017-02-24 08:37:10	na_th_an	and she's like
2017-02-24 08:37:19	na_th_an	like…do we notify accessibility tools that we opened a new view/modal, do we put focus on the modal, do we have alt text for the links so they know when it opens in a new tab/window, etc?
2017-02-24 08:37:22	na_th_an	[5:26]  
2017-02-24 08:37:24	na_th_an	i ask because once upon a time accessibility was in the definition of done, and we’re getting more and more institutions asking about our compliance
2017-02-24 08:37:26	na_th_an	that's your job
2017-02-24 08:37:34	na_th_an	and if you want alt text, that's your job to tell me what to put there
2017-02-24 08:37:41	na_th_an	because I'm not allowed to just write whatever I want
2017-02-24 08:37:50	keveloper	lol
2017-02-24 08:37:57	keveloper	idk man
2017-02-24 08:38:00	keveloper	doesn't coreui do that
2017-02-24 08:38:04	na_th_an	yes!
2017-02-24 08:38:15	na_th_an	which is what I have to tell this senior UX designer with a CSE degree
2017-02-24 08:38:25	na_th_an	for not the first time
2017-02-24 08:38:28	keveloper	lol
2017-02-24 08:39:34	keveloper	yanno

2017-02-24 08:42:22	keveloper	in pop music at least
2017-02-24 08:42:26	keveloper	billboard top 100
2017-02-24 08:42:30	na_th_an	i don't know that much about new music
2017-02-24 08:54:13	na_th_an	I also wonder how many places use wireframe vs photoshop
2017-02-24 08:54:28	na_th_an	I wish we got photoshop mockups
2017-02-24 09:21:37	keveloper	can you double check my reading of that iptable command in ##webdev
2017-02-25 00:16:46	<--	na_th_an (~na_th_an@172.ip-158-69-48.net) has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2017-02-25 00:18:27	-->	na_th_an (~na_th_an@172.ip-158-69-48.net) is back on server
2017-03-06 16:26:58	keveloper	read the whole email
2017-03-06 16:27:09	keveloper	"You three were chosen for this because of your speed, aggression (meaning you tend to "own" the problem and run with it) and technical skills - it's a reflection of Rashmi's and my trust that you're being entrusted with the largest revenue generator in the Discovery space. We believe you are most capable of driving this forward."
2017-03-06 16:27:37	keveloper	by the end of this i expect $80k/yr
2017-03-06 16:27:37	na_th_an	then I want a fucking raise
2017-03-06 16:27:42	na_th_an	this is so not okay
2017-03-06 16:27:49	keveloper	im gonna say something in our one on one
2017-03-06 16:27:53	keveloper	like im humbled
2017-03-06 16:27:55	keveloper	honestly
2017-03-06 16:28:02	keveloper	but this does not reflect my pay grade
2017-03-06 16:28:15	na_th_an	I'm not humbled
2017-03-06 16:28:18	na_th_an	I feel taken advantage of
2017-03-06 16:28:22	na_th_an	this is 100% not okay
2017-03-06 16:28:27	na_th_an	they know this is work nobody wants to do
2017-03-06 16:28:27	keveloper	its not being taken advantage of
2017-03-06 16:28:31	keveloper	no no no
2017-03-06 16:28:56	keveloper	i think they are being 100% genuine when they say the trust that we will do a good job of this
2017-03-06 16:29:00	na_th_an	wtf does highlander mean
2017-03-06 16:29:02	na_th_an	yes they are
2017-03-06 16:29:05	keveloper	idk i think that was a joke
2017-03-06 16:29:06	na_th_an	because they don't realize how shitty this is
2017-03-06 16:29:26	keveloper	they are saying this is something important and they trust us to do it well
2017-03-06 16:29:42	keveloper	the email it self is a pretty big compliment
2017-03-06 16:29:48	keveloper	granted the work sucks
2017-03-06 16:29:51	na_th_an	it's a pretty big "fuck you"
2017-03-06 16:30:00	keveloper	as far as pay yeah
2017-03-06 16:30:02	na_th_an	I only read fuck you
2017-03-06 16:30:06	keveloper	i think you are looking at this the wrong way
2017-03-06 16:30:06	na_th_an	after being on snowflake
2017-03-06 16:30:13	keveloper	they arent like "lets make nathan hate his job"
2017-03-06 16:30:17	na_th_an	except they are
2017-03-06 16:30:20	na_th_an	they aren't on purpose
2017-03-06 16:30:22	na_th_an	but they are
2017-03-06 16:30:27	keveloper	well yeah but
2017-03-06 16:30:45	keveloper	they need something important done that has been an issue for a while and they are trusting us to handle it
2017-03-06 16:30:46	na_th_an	I am not going to work on firstsearch for 6 months
2017-03-06 16:30:49	na_th_an	I am not going to do it
2017-03-06 16:30:52	na_th_an	no
2017-03-06 16:30:55	na_th_an	I'll fucking quit
2017-03-06 16:30:56	keveloper	well its us and zach so
2017-03-06 16:31:01	keveloper	come on dont quit
2017-03-06 16:31:13	na_th_an	I am not working on firstsearch for 6 months
2017-03-06 16:31:27	keveloper	this is not 100% working on first search for 6 months
2017-03-06 16:32:02	keveloper	like you will still be doing dev work
2017-03-06 16:32:04	na_th_an	what does he mean by "Highlander situation"
2017-03-06 16:32:09	keveloper	i think it was a joke
2017-03-06 16:32:16	na_th_an	oh so I get to be split between dev work and supporting firstsearch?
2017-03-06 16:32:17	na_th_an	that's no better
2017-03-06 16:33:13	keveloper	idk
2017-03-06 16:33:25	keveloper	not everything you do in your career is going to be awesome
2017-03-06 16:33:44	na_th_an	no but I want to work on something sorta modern
2017-03-06 16:33:59	keveloper	i mean you will be mostly this is just support and doc
2017-03-06 16:33:59	na_th_an	I don't want to spend my career supporting monolithic web applications that nobody understands
2017-03-06 16:34:07	keveloper	i dont either
2017-03-06 16:34:17	na_th_an	do you know how fucked up fs is in dev and qa right now?
2017-03-06 16:34:28	keveloper	i've seen a lot of traffic on it ya
2017-03-06 16:34:29	na_th_an	this is just showing me that oclc is not somewhere that I want to stay
2017-03-06 16:34:41	na_th_an	it's not aligning with my career goals
2017-03-06 16:34:42	keveloper	yeah same
2017-03-06 16:34:59	na_th_an	they are not treating me like a valued employee
2017-03-06 16:35:19	keveloper	how
2017-03-06 16:35:28	na_th_an	by giving us shit work they know nobody else wants to do
2017-03-06 16:35:40	na_th_an	and then not giving us any kind of recognition for doing shit work
2017-03-06 16:35:44	keveloper	idk think thats how they saw this
2017-03-06 16:35:52	keveloper	i dont think**
2017-03-06 16:35:56	na_th_an	for telling us things like "you are the most capable" but not compensating
2017-03-06 16:36:07	na_th_an	they didn't think "let's give kevin and nathan shit work"
2017-03-06 16:36:14	keveloper	well yeah thats in a wednesday discussion with bill
2017-03-06 16:36:26	na_th_an	but they also didn't think "maybe give nathan and kevin some decent work after being thrown onto snowflake for months"
2017-03-06 16:36:30	keveloper	i mean its shit that needs to be done and i know not many other people would do a good job with it
2017-03-06 16:36:45	na_th_an	okay then can we talk about how people who make way more than us can't be trusted to do a good job
2017-03-06 16:36:53	keveloper	i mean be realistic
2017-03-06 16:37:01	keveloper	they cant put this off just so we can have fun work
2017-03-06 16:37:08	na_th_an	no 
2017-03-06 16:37:17	na_th_an	but they could make some of our consulting engineers act like it
2017-03-06 16:37:22	na_th_an	other than bryan
2017-03-06 16:37:27	keveloper	or make us consulting engineers lol
2017-03-06 16:37:28	keveloper	rich
2017-03-06 16:37:33	na_th_an	yeah rich
2017-03-06 16:37:42	na_th_an	jinbin and mark do not perform on the same level as rich and bryan
2017-03-06 16:37:44	keveloper	idk jinbin and jimmy are pretty good
2017-03-06 16:37:59	na_th_an	jinbin is pretty fine but he got taken off snowflake so I'm kinda salty about that
2017-03-06 16:38:34	na_th_an	if I didn't try as hard I'd just be getting tickets off the backlog and project work
2017-03-06 16:38:47	na_th_an	I'd be getting more work I'd actually want to do
2017-03-06 16:39:12	keveloper	well unfortunately better people generally get the more difficult not fun work
2017-03-06 16:39:47	na_th_an	yes and they don't pay you more for it so you have to leave and negotiate a better salary at the next place
2017-03-06 16:40:12	keveloper	im going to do that in august if i dont $75k yet
2017-03-06 16:40:13	keveloper	lol
2017-03-06 16:40:19	na_th_an	if they give me a decent promotion I'd maybe do it
2017-03-06 16:40:20	keveloper	I can get $75 at the next place
2017-03-06 16:40:30	keveloper	you are saying you are going to quit tomorrow
2017-03-06 16:40:34	keveloper	if you dont get a promotion
2017-03-06 16:40:40	na_th_an	no not tomorrow
2017-03-06 16:41:05	na_th_an	but if they are seriously telling us we're the ones that are most trusted with the biggest revenue maker in our group
2017-03-06 16:41:13	na_th_an	and we are being paid the least amount of money
2017-03-06 16:41:18	na_th_an	then we are being taken advantage of
2017-03-06 16:41:52	keveloper	Unfortunately that's how business works...
2017-03-06 16:42:21	keveloper	As far as labor goes this task could cost $60+k more
2017-03-06 16:43:02	na_th_an	I don't see what you mean
2017-03-06 16:43:13	keveloper	which sentence
2017-03-06 16:43:16	na_th_an	both
2017-03-06 16:43:30	keveloper	companies want the best work for the least amount of money
2017-03-06 16:43:33	na_th_an	well yes
2017-03-06 16:43:40	keveloper	It's not supposed to be "fair" as far as they see it
2017-03-06 16:43:44	na_th_an	so we have to go get new jobs elsewhere to be compensated fairly
2017-03-06 16:43:48	keveloper	Right
2017-03-06 16:43:49	na_th_an	because oclc isn't going to do it for us
2017-03-06 16:43:58	na_th_an	because they're taking advantage of us right now
2017-03-06 16:44:13	keveloper	they're taking advantage of everyone at the company thats why they hired us
2017-03-06 16:44:27	na_th_an	they aren't taking advantage of mark
2017-03-06 16:44:47	na_th_an	some people are fairly compensated for what they do
2017-03-06 16:44:53	keveloper	yeah mark is taking advantage of them
2017-03-06 16:44:56	na_th_an	some people are unfairly compensated (too much or too little)
2017-03-06 16:45:03	keveloper	you cant expect to be fresh out of college and not be taken advantage of
2017-03-06 16:45:08	keveloper	im not saying its right
2017-03-06 16:45:13	keveloper	im just saying its not unusual
2017-03-06 16:45:19	keveloper	and dont take it out on bill and rashmi
2017-03-06 16:45:20	na_th_an	I'm not saying it isn't
2017-03-06 16:45:30	na_th_an	what do you mean take it out
2017-03-06 16:45:41	keveloper	idk sometimes you get frustrated at them
2017-03-06 16:45:41	na_th_an	I'll communicate to rashmi again that I feel I deserve a promotion
2017-03-06 16:45:44	keveloper	or it seems that way 
2017-03-06 16:45:50	keveloper	yeah im gonna talk to bill on wednesday
2017-03-06 16:45:56	na_th_an	well obv I am but it's not like I go tell them that to their face
2017-03-06 16:46:30	keveloper	well they arent the reasons we are paid more
2017-03-06 16:46:31	keveloper	arent*
2017-03-06 16:46:37	keveloper	esp. rashmi
2017-03-06 16:47:17	keveloper	she was knew when you had your performance review there's no way she wouldve proposed a promotion or big raise when she was that new and didn't quite know you yet
2017-03-06 16:47:43	keveloper	they can only do so much yanno
2017-03-06 16:47:49	na_th_an	yeah but she could be talking to katie about it
2017-03-06 16:47:57	na_th_an	or actually know what title I'd get promoted to
2017-03-06 16:48:02	keveloper	im sure if katie was like "you guys have $50k of raises to give out" me and oyu would get a good amount of that
2017-03-06 16:48:15	na_th_an	or say "I think you deserve it, I'm trying to fight for you" instead of telling me I need to meet my stretch goals
2017-03-06 16:48:39	keveloper	i think she's more likely to say that now than last time you talked to her
2017-03-06 16:48:53	na_th_an	it wasn't that long ago that I talked to her about it last
2017-03-06 16:48:57	keveloper	she seems to be more settled in and comfortable with the environment and stuff
2017-03-06 16:48:58	keveloper	i guess so
2017-03-06 16:49:04	na_th_an	and it's not like I've done anything incredible on citations
2017-03-06 16:49:10	keveloper	i mean she's just regurgitating what she is told
2017-03-06 16:49:31	na_th_an	I feel like you're arguing a point but I don't know why
2017-03-06 16:49:38	keveloper	idk
2017-03-06 16:49:53	keveloper	im just saying idk how much rashmi can do about it
2017-03-06 16:50:05	na_th_an	she could start by knowing what position I'd get promoted to 
2017-03-06 16:50:17	keveloper	have you tried to look shit up in sharepoint lol
2017-03-06 16:50:20	na_th_an	yes
2017-03-06 16:50:27	na_th_an	I know how to find the job descriptions
2017-03-06 16:50:36	keveloper	idk maybe shes afraid to ask questions idk man
2017-03-06 16:50:37	na_th_an	she emailed me Sr Software Architect 
2017-03-06 16:50:40	keveloper	that was weird that didnt know
2017-03-06 16:50:43	keveloper	i mean that just sounds wrong
2017-03-06 16:50:47	na_th_an	and I'm like "Wouldn't it be Sr Software Engineer?"
2017-03-06 16:50:49	keveloper	that WOULD technically be a promotion lol
2017-03-06 16:50:54	na_th_an	but I was wrong too
2017-03-06 16:50:57	na_th_an	it's not even sr
2017-03-06 16:51:01	na_th_an	it's just normal "Software Engineer"
2017-03-06 16:51:03	keveloper	yeah its just software engineer
2017-03-06 16:51:09	keveloper	we are software dev
2017-03-06 16:54:41	keveloper	wanna leave
2017-03-06 16:55:28	keveloper	like for the day
2017-03-06 16:56:11	na_th_an	uh yeah
2017-03-06 16:56:21	keveloper	cool
2017-03-07 09:02:14	keveloper	so
2017-03-07 09:02:28	na_th_an	ya
2017-03-07 09:02:34	keveloper	we are doing that suggestion thing like amazon right
2017-03-07 09:02:40	keveloper	so if you type 'hi'
2017-03-07 09:02:42	keveloper	it will be like
2017-03-07 09:02:50	keveloper	'hi in Title' 'hi in Subject'
2017-03-07 09:02:53	na_th_an	ya
2017-03-07 09:02:56	na_th_an	I saw the wireframes
2017-03-07 09:02:58	keveloper	UX estimated
2017-03-07 09:03:01	keveloper	12 hours
2017-03-07 09:03:02	keveloper	to review
2017-03-07 09:03:08	na_th_an	to review?_
2017-03-07 09:03:12	keveloper	yes
2017-03-07 09:03:21	na_th_an	hmm
2017-03-07 09:03:23	keveloper	sorry 16
2017-03-07 09:03:26	na_th_an	that seems a little high
2017-03-07 09:03:29	keveloper	maybe that included making the wireframes
2017-03-07 09:03:41	keveloper	i dunno
2017-03-07 09:03:48	keveloper	QA estimated 12 hours
2017-03-07 09:03:58	na_th_an	our estimates are trash
2017-03-07 09:04:01	keveloper	which is more realistic but still seems hi lol
2017-03-07 09:04:07	na_th_an	hi
2017-03-07 09:04:13	keveloper	my space bar is squeaky
2017-03-07 09:04:45	na_th_an	my caps are classicy
2017-03-07 09:05:45	keveloper	what if i just put like a 2x1 key for my spacebar lol
2017-03-07 09:05:59	na_th_an	then it'll be what you just said
2017-03-07 09:06:08	na_th_an	it might make the key do backspace tho
2017-03-07 09:06:33	keveloper	my space bar is currently my backspace of my v60
2017-03-07 09:06:48	na_th_an	y

2017-03-07 09:37:36	na_th_an	I wonder if rashmi is trying to get rid of mark

2017-03-07 09:50:43	na_th_an	she knows he's way underperforming
2017-03-07 09:50:53	na_th_an	one of the only things he did last release didn't work
2017-03-07 09:51:10	keveloper	lol rly

2017-03-07 11:07:40	keveloper	while i was gone
2017-03-07 11:08:12	keveloper	that window.location.origin thing happened right
2017-03-07 11:08:27	na_th_an	ya
2017-03-07 11:08:33	keveloper	which had an if statement to check if it was defined anyway
2017-03-07 11:08:39	keveloper	so that IE10 just didn't do anything
2017-03-07 11:08:43	keveloper	but IE11 works
2017-03-07 11:08:50	keveloper	anyway
2017-03-07 11:08:54	keveloper	so that was removed
2017-03-07 11:09:02	na_th_an	yeah because it wasn't needed right?
2017-03-07 11:09:03	keveloper	but also the whole module for the permalink dialog was deleted
2017-03-07 11:09:13	keveloper	well i mean it sort of is
2017-03-07 11:09:25	keveloper	if im at 21274.on.worldcat.org/oclc/123
2017-03-07 11:09:29	keveloper	the origin thing kept 21274
2017-03-07 11:09:39	keveloper	without it it rewrite 21274 to ocwms
2017-03-07 11:09:59	keveloper	it rewrites it to the symbol always instead of keeping what you are using, but w/e idc
2017-03-07 11:10:10	keveloper	also you can do env specific permalinks without it
2017-03-07 11:10:13	keveloper	but again w/e idc
2017-03-07 11:10:15	keveloper	cant***
2017-03-07 11:10:35	keveloper	but the whole module for the dialog was removed
2017-03-07 11:10:52	keveloper	so now it doesn't even focus and highlight the link like it used it
2017-03-07 11:10:56	keveloper	used to*
2017-03-07 11:10:56	keveloper	so
2017-03-07 11:13:18	na_th_an	idk what you mean because I have no idea what the workflows are like for permalink or what the dialog looks like or anything
2017-03-07 11:14:16	keveloper	-_-
2017-03-07 11:18:04	na_th_an	<ruleset name="Ballin' Ruleset"
2017-03-07 11:18:20	na_th_an	take a guess
2017-03-07 11:18:33	keveloper	brandon zeeb
2017-03-07 11:18:41	na_th_an	yeah
2017-03-08 09:51:38	keveloper	who spoke chinese to who first
2017-03-08 09:51:40	keveloper	ying or jinbin
2017-03-08 09:51:52	keveloper	like they probably only spoke english when they first met
2017-03-08 09:51:54	keveloper	but at some point
2017-03-08 09:52:01	keveloper	someone would have had to speak chinese first
2017-03-08 09:52:05	na_th_an	ask
2017-03-08 09:52:09	keveloper	lol
2017-03-08 09:52:09	keveloper	no

2017-03-08 09:52:48	keveloper	"do you know chinese"
2017-03-08 09:52:52	keveloper	and she was like "yeah"
2017-03-08 09:53:22	na_th_an	but it was different dialects 
2017-03-08 09:53:27	na_th_an	they were from warring cities
2017-03-08 09:53:38	na_th_an	but they learned to love each other through coding
2017-03-08 09:53:45	keveloper	lol
2017-03-08 09:54:00	keveloper	what if one day there's like someone attacking people in the office
2017-03-08 09:54:07	keveloper	and jinbin jumps in front of ying to save her
2017-03-08 09:54:27	keveloper	i wonder if they have hung out outside of the office
2017-03-08 12:38:44	keveloper	what should i say in 1 on 1
2017-03-08 12:39:13	na_th_an	brm
2017-03-08 12:39:16	na_th_an	brb
2017-03-08 12:39:17	keveloper	k
2017-03-08 12:42:39	na_th_an	i don't even know
2017-03-08 12:42:51	na_th_an	"why are you asking your lowest paid developers to produce support documents for the highest paid"
2017-03-08 12:43:08	keveloper	yeah
2017-03-08 12:43:21	na_th_an	"why are the people with 1 year of experience being asked to document systems that other team members have actually worked on"
2017-03-08 12:43:32	keveloper	"I feel that I am very under valued on this team, and being asked to do tasks well above my paygrade"
2017-03-08 12:43:37	na_th_an	"why are the 2 of the most qualified people for this task 2 of the lowest paid on the team"
2017-03-08 12:44:01	na_th_an	I almost just want to be like
2017-03-08 12:44:13	na_th_an	"you're serious? and you don't see how ridiculous this is?"
2017-03-08 12:44:27	keveloper	i mean its not like they can just give us $10k raises
2017-03-08 12:44:31	keveloper	im sure if they could they would
2017-03-08 12:44:42	na_th_an	they can give us not completely shit tasks
2017-03-08 12:44:51	keveloper	yeah but this is something that needs done
2017-03-08 12:45:03	na_th_an	but that's not our problem
2017-03-08 12:45:06	keveloper	its just that they think we are the most ccapable to do it
2017-03-08 12:45:11	na_th_an	and that's fucked
2017-03-08 12:45:17	na_th_an	at the end of the day, I'm not doing this
2017-03-08 12:45:21	na_th_an	that's all I'm sure about
2017-03-08 12:45:40	keveloper	im going to build a beefy impressive web app in rails and apply to covermymeds lol
2017-03-08 12:46:30	na_th_an	I was already contacted on linked in by a guy from boy scouts 
2017-03-08 12:46:35	na_th_an	he's a vp of some company 
2017-03-08 12:46:41	na_th_an	and he's asking me what languages I program in
2017-03-08 12:47:04	na_th_an	stephen is still grade 15
2017-03-08 12:47:10	na_th_an	I just assume there is no track forward here for us
2017-03-08 12:47:16	keveloper	same
2017-03-08 12:47:17	na_th_an	they've done nothing to prove us otherwise
2017-03-08 12:47:41	na_th_an	that's probably a good way to open up the conversation
2017-03-08 12:47:53	na_th_an	say that you feel like there's no path forward for your career here right now
2017-03-08 12:48:16	keveloper	he's just gonna give me some stretch goal bullshit
2017-03-08 12:48:25	keveloper	then say after the first search work is done maybe i'll get a raise
2017-03-08 12:48:26	na_th_an	yeah he will
2017-03-08 12:48:31	keveloper	a whole 3%
2017-03-08 12:50:23	keveloper	i need to make a site under construction page for my portofolio lol
2017-03-08 12:50:25	keveloper	its like broken rn
2017-03-08 12:50:37	keveloper	and on my linked in
2017-03-08 12:51:49	na_th_an	I think they're going to try to be like "it'll only be 50% of your time it's not so bad"
2017-03-08 12:52:19	keveloper	i'd be a little happier doing it as a team
2017-03-08 12:52:21	keveloper	at least a pair
2017-03-08 12:53:44	na_th_an	yeah
2017-03-08 12:53:49	na_th_an	but that's not in the budget
2017-03-08 12:54:24	keveloper	the $16 million budget
2017-03-08 12:57:57	na_th_an	I wanna ask rashmi
2017-03-08 12:58:01	na_th_an	"Why should I work hard"
2017-03-08 12:58:13	keveloper	i know right
2017-03-08 12:58:31	na_th_an	"I'm tired of getting constant compliments and being told I deserve a raise, then getting crappy projects nobody else wants to or can do."
2017-03-08 13:50:10	keveloper	1 on 1 coming up
2017-03-08 13:50:20	keveloper	i just want to make it known that i feel very under valued
2017-03-08 13:50:39	na_th_an	gl gl
2017-03-08 13:50:47	keveloper	and that i do not have competitive compensation given my skillset w/e
2017-03-08 13:50:52	keveloper	what do you think
2017-03-08 13:51:03	na_th_an	they're not about to fire you or pay you less
2017-03-08 13:51:10	na_th_an	unless you're a total asshole
2017-03-08 13:51:10	keveloper	true
2017-03-08 13:51:13	na_th_an	which you're not gonna be
2017-03-08 13:51:16	na_th_an	so
2017-03-08 13:51:21	keveloper	everyone can relate to wanting to be paid more
2017-03-08 13:51:22	keveloper	so
2017-03-08 13:51:35	na_th_an	they *have* to know they're taking advantage of us at this point
2017-03-08 13:51:48	keveloper	yeah
2017-03-08 14:26:03	keveloper	i bet stephen hasn't actively sought out a raise tho
2017-03-08 14:27:18	na_th_an	he probably hasn't
2017-03-08 14:27:33	keveloper	hopefully this works out
2017-03-08 14:27:35	na_th_an	but like
2017-03-08 14:27:40	keveloper	i'd like to stay (and not do first search)
2017-03-08 14:27:49	na_th_an	the only person who I've ever heard of getting a promotion was zach
2017-03-08 14:28:08	keveloper	rothlan
2017-03-08 14:28:11	na_th_an	rothlan apparently has gotten promotions too but not recently
2017-03-08 14:28:19	na_th_an	not as recently, and not under EUS
2017-03-08 14:28:20	keveloper	no pretty recently
2017-03-08 14:28:30	na_th_an	his recent promotions were not under EUS
2017-03-08 14:28:30	keveloper	last summer he got one
2017-03-08 14:28:34	keveloper	rly
2017-03-08 14:28:37	na_th_an	p usre
2017-03-08 14:28:40	na_th_an	sure
2017-03-08 14:28:46	keveloper	well i'll break the mold lol
2017-03-08 14:28:56	na_th_an	but like basically zach is the most recent person to do it in our group
2017-03-08 14:28:57	keveloper	nobody has gotten promotions because they rose too fast
2017-03-08 14:29:00	na_th_an	so that's what we can look forward to
2017-03-08 14:29:00	keveloper	and young people leave
2017-03-08 14:29:14	na_th_an	where zach was tech lead for grade 18s as a grade 16
2017-03-08 14:29:21	na_th_an	that what it took to get him up to... grade 17
2017-03-08 14:29:26	keveloper	ya
2017-03-08 14:29:29	na_th_an	and that's just bullshit
2017-03-08 14:29:58	keveloper	they should fire mark and split his salary between us and zach lol
2017-03-08 14:30:05	na_th_an	they really should
2017-03-08 14:30:27	keveloper	also i need to freelance m ore
2017-03-08 14:30:29	na_th_an	I just can't believe he's still around
2017-03-08 14:31:14	keveloper	bill seems to be getting more comfortable with us and telling us things he shouldnt
2017-03-08 14:31:15	keveloper	yanno
2017-03-08 14:31:33	keveloper	like being honest about other people
2017-03-08 14:31:36	na_th_an	yeah
2017-03-08 14:31:49	na_th_an	that doesn't really make me feel any better
2017-03-08 14:32:10	na_th_an	it doesn't help to hear that other people who have experience and make way more money are underperforming
2017-03-08 14:32:11	keveloper	idk just keep in mind that he cant just hand out raises
2017-03-08 14:32:16	keveloper	also rashmi is your manager though
2017-03-08 14:32:16	na_th_an	while being told that you're overperforming
2017-03-08 14:32:20	na_th_an	I know they can't
2017-03-08 14:32:29	na_th_an	I don't expect to get a raise next week
2017-03-08 14:32:31	keveloper	i think you are less lucky with rashmi being your manager
2017-03-08 14:32:43	keveloper	because she is new
2017-03-08 14:32:45	na_th_an	yeah she's more afraid to go to upper management because she's newer
2017-03-08 14:32:52	keveloper	ya
2017-03-08 14:58:42	keveloper	you wanna get paid to help merkazu build a automated build/deploy process for an LMS he's making
2017-03-08 15:06:12	keveloper	wtf my dad just said "can you talk now" "meet me in the cafeteria"
2017-03-08 15:06:13	keveloper	uhhhh
2017-03-08 15:06:20	na_th_an	uhhhh
2017-03-08 15:06:28	na_th_an	better go cafe
2017-03-08 15:23:17	na_th_an	rip
2017-03-08 15:56:50	keveloper	back
2017-03-08 15:56:53	na_th_an	hi
2017-03-08 15:56:55	na_th_an	r u ded
2017-03-08 15:57:04	keveloper	i have info that will blow your mind
2017-03-08 15:57:12	keveloper	you dont need the sybase client to talk to sybase
2017-03-08 15:57:15	keveloper	you can use jdbc
2017-03-08 15:57:27	na_th_an	um
2017-03-08 15:57:29	na_th_an	0 mind blown
2017-03-08 15:57:34	keveloper	lol did you know that already
2017-03-08 15:57:46	na_th_an	I would have guessed that there's a sybase jdbc client 
2017-03-08 15:57:59	keveloper	i might do the first search stuff
2017-03-08 15:58:01	keveloper	it could be interesting
2017-03-08 15:58:05	keveloper	my dad knows a shit ton about it
2017-03-08 15:58:17	na_th_an	I don't think the optimal way is to use the fucked up jar they have
2017-03-08 15:58:36	na_th_an	the jar they have in the sybase client is might just a stupid abstaction over jdbc
2017-03-08 15:58:45	na_th_an	maybe not but it wouldn't surprise me
2017-03-08 15:58:49	keveloper	i dont think so
2017-03-08 15:58:57	keveloper	so the reason my dad asked me down there:
2017-03-08 15:59:09	keveloper	john krause is retiring this summer
2017-03-08 15:59:20	keveloper	they are splitting his position up into two
2017-03-08 15:59:31	keveloper	russ who currently does UI stuff is moving to back end stuff
2017-03-08 15:59:34	keveloper	they need a UI person
2017-03-08 15:59:39	keveloper	jim davenport is interested in me
2017-03-08 16:00:06	keveloper	i said it would be weird because my dad is on the team but he said jim doesn't care
2017-03-08 16:00:19	na_th_an	gl gl
2017-03-08 16:00:26	na_th_an	3rd floor is obv the place to be
2017-03-08 16:00:31	keveloper	it would be in like may or something
2017-03-08 16:00:32	na_th_an	or at least, not on this team
2017-03-08 16:00:39	keveloper	apparently there's a lot of freedom in what they do for UI
2017-03-08 16:00:44	keveloper	and they dont install through SOC
2017-03-08 16:00:48	na_th_an	well yeah they don't have dumbass users

2017-03-08 16:01:54	keveloper	but yeah i might volunteer to do first search stuff if i get one other person with me and 50%
2017-03-08 16:09:18	keveloper	everytime i start up my computer and launch RL its at 20fps
2017-03-08 16:09:20	keveloper	oh speaking of which
2017-03-08 16:09:24	keveloper	RL = resource locator
2017-03-08 16:09:40	na_th_an	20fps?
2017-03-08 16:09:47	keveloper	yes
2017-03-08 16:09:55	na_th_an	like
2017-03-08 16:09:57	na_th_an	then it goes up?

2017-03-08 16:10:16	na_th_an	is your frame limit set in RL

2017-03-08 16:10:35	na_th_an	does it stay at a solid 20fps or does it fluctuate

2017-03-08 16:10:48	keveloper	18-22
2017-03-08 16:10:54	na_th_an	reapply the framerate?
2017-03-08 16:11:11	keveloper	go to nvidia control panel, change to 120Hz, go back to 144Hz

2017-03-08 16:12:18	na_th_an	it doesn't really do anything except tell you to upgrade your driver and use resources in the background
2017-03-08 16:12:21	keveloper	it doesn't even work for me anyway
2017-03-08 16:12:30	na_th_an	it's pretty worthless

2017-03-10 09:38:05	keveloper	i was watching the waves in the pond and the movement of the water and the different reflection and refraction that was happening from the sun/sky and it made me think about how much i dont know

2017-03-13 15:54:50	keveloper	lol
2017-03-14 09:11:46	keveloper	i was watching harika code yesterday
2017-03-14 09:11:53	keveloper	helping her with relator changes
2017-03-14 09:11:54	keveloper	it was rough
2017-03-14 09:12:04	na_th_an	I bet
2017-03-14 09:13:13	keveloper	hmmm
2017-03-14 09:13:19	keveloper	i need to talk something out
2017-03-14 09:13:21	keveloper	so
2017-03-14 09:13:40	na_th_an	so
2017-03-14 09:13:45	keveloper	if ti:blahblah is the value
2017-03-14 09:13:48	keveloper	ti: is the index
2017-03-14 09:13:52	keveloper	and blahblah is the term
2017-03-14 09:13:58	keveloper	that logic is here
2017-03-14 09:13:58	keveloper	var indexes = inputValue.match(/[a-z][a-z]:/g);
2017-03-14 09:14:46	keveloper	so
2017-03-14 09:14:54	keveloper	ti:dog and su:food
2017-03-14 09:15:05	keveloper	returns ['ti:', 'su:']
2017-03-14 09:15:06	keveloper	great
2017-03-14 09:15:09	keveloper	but
2017-03-14 09:15:16	keveloper	star wars: the clone wars
2017-03-14 09:15:17	keveloper	returns
2017-03-14 09:15:18	keveloper	rs:
2017-03-14 09:15:43	keveloper	so the index can either be the first thing in the input
2017-03-14 09:15:46	keveloper	or after white space
2017-03-14 09:15:50	keveloper	i can use ^
2017-03-14 09:16:15	keveloper	idk how to say
2017-03-14 09:16:27	keveloper	'beginning of the string or whitespace before it'
2017-03-14 09:17:16	na_th_an	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16825316/regex-anchors-inside-character-class
2017-03-14 09:17:31	na_th_an	that's the best I got
2017-03-14 09:17:49	keveloper	why does that not exist
2017-03-14 09:18:26	na_th_an	probably because regex is a very limited language of regular expressions that can be implemented in DFAs and what we need can't be implemented in a single DFA
2017-03-14 09:18:57	keveloper	also like
2017-03-14 09:19:03	keveloper	what if someone puts ' ti:dog'
2017-03-14 09:19:53	na_th_an	appending a space and searching for whitespace before doesn't sound like a bad idea
2017-03-14 09:20:21	keveloper	prepending
2017-03-14 09:20:23	keveloper	GET IT RIGHT
2017-03-14 09:20:51	na_th_an	you sent me a localhost url today

2017-03-14 09:25:09	keveloper	shit now the white space is part of the index
2017-03-14 09:25:10	keveloper	uh
2017-03-14 09:25:40	keveloper	if this was groovy thatd be dope
2017-03-14 09:25:54	na_th_an	why isn't it

2017-03-15 09:08:09	na_th_an	it's kinda weird how you have handleKeyUp and handleKeyDown

2017-03-16 15:21:41	na_th_an	instead of "this is a bad business decision"
2017-03-16 15:21:57	keveloper	if find was like "come write our new search algorithm with us"

2017-03-16 15:22:19	keveloper	"i will be of virtually no help"

2017-03-17 11:09:38	keveloper	knew it
2017-03-17 11:10:01	keveloper	I wanna standardize our branch names but rich wont like that
2017-03-17 11:10:21	keveloper	At least we can standardize epic, ticket
2017-03-17 11:10:32	keveloper	because right now sometimes its feature and sometimes its epic
2017-03-17 11:10:35	keveloper	i think it should be
2017-03-17 11:10:37	na_th_an	idk why zach wants to do release and develop branches
2017-03-17 11:10:43	keveloper	epic/blah/DA-123
2017-03-17 11:10:48	keveloper	git-flow
2017-03-17 11:10:53	keveloper	git-flow is really popular
2017-03-17 11:10:58	na_th_an	I know other people do it
2017-03-17 11:11:04	keveloper	https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/
2017-03-17 11:11:09	na_th_an	I know I've looked at it
2017-03-17 11:11:13	keveloper	rip thats not a good source for that
2017-03-17 11:11:19	na_th_an	I just don't see what it'd buy our team
2017-03-17 11:11:20	keveloper	I really like our idea
2017-03-17 11:11:30	keveloper	master -> feature -> epic
2017-03-17 11:11:42	na_th_an	yeah I really like that
2017-03-17 11:11:54	keveloper	master -> hostfix -> release
2017-03-17 11:12:02	keveloper	master -> staging -> ticket
2017-03-17 11:12:22	keveloper	master -> dev -> feature -> epic
2017-03-17 11:12:35	keveloper	seems like you are just moving those issue out to another branch
2017-03-17 11:12:41	keveloper	we could do
2017-03-17 11:12:51	keveloper	master -> staging -> feature -> epic
2017-03-17 11:13:00	keveloper	master -> staging -> ticket
2017-03-17 11:13:15	keveloper	master -> hotfix -> release
2017-03-17 11:13:22	keveloper	i meant epic -> ticket up there btw
2017-03-17 11:13:35	keveloper	I kind of like:
2017-03-17 11:13:48	keveloper	master -> staging -> epic -> ticket
2017-03-17 11:13:58	keveloper	master -> staging -> ticket_no_epic
2017-03-17 11:14:48	keveloper	master -> hotfix -> release [TAG AND RELEASE] -> staging
2017-03-17 11:15:07	na_th_an	your arrows are weird
2017-03-17 11:15:13	keveloper	should they go the other way you mean
2017-03-17 11:15:21	na_th_an	because they are pointing the opposite direction of the direction code flows
2017-03-17 11:15:27	keveloper	lol iknow
2017-03-17 11:15:39	keveloper	ticket -> epic -> staging -> master
2017-03-17 11:15:45	na_th_an	why staging tho
2017-03-17 11:16:00	keveloper	ticket -> staging -> master
2017-03-17 11:16:04	keveloper	for things that dont have epics
2017-03-17 11:16:10	keveloper	so everything is integrated before master
2017-03-17 11:16:21	keveloper	staging is CI
2017-03-17 11:16:41	na_th_an	if we wait until things are qa accepted before going into staging it doesn't buy us anything
2017-03-17 11:16:52	keveloper	integration can fuck things up though
2017-03-17 11:16:56	na_th_an	yes
2017-03-17 11:17:00	na_th_an	I'm not arguing that
2017-03-17 11:17:06	na_th_an	but if that's the problem we're trying to solve
2017-03-17 11:17:13	na_th_an	then qa needs to accept things in staging
2017-03-17 11:17:15	na_th_an	not on epic branch
2017-03-17 11:17:35	na_th_an	that's a weakness in our current process
2017-03-17 11:17:43	na_th_an	but if we don't let pull requests sit open for weeks
2017-03-17 11:17:47	na_th_an	it won't be as big of an issue
2017-03-17 11:18:52	na_th_an	so where lunch
2017-03-17 11:19:45	keveloper	idc
2017-03-17 11:19:48	keveloper	i dont really want wendys
2017-03-17 11:19:52	keveloper	piada or windchimes
2017-03-17 11:19:59	keveloper	i havent had piada in a week or so
2017-03-17 11:20:09	na_th_an	piada

2017-03-17 11:38:03	keveloper	sure
2017-03-17 12:59:39	keveloper	i hated in that sf meeting when bill was telling people shit they didnt need to know
2017-03-17 12:59:45	keveloper	and all of his long story short shit
2017-03-17 12:59:54	keveloper	and yadda yadda yadda
2017-03-17 12:59:55	na_th_an	ya he does that sometimes
2017-03-17 13:05:14	na_th_an	something makes me really uncomfortable when rashmi shares dilberts
2017-03-17 13:05:27	na_th_an	those are supposed to be developers making fun of management
2017-03-17 13:05:57	keveloper	lol
2017-03-17 13:38:35	keveloper	does this match what you did
2017-03-17 13:38:36	keveloper	    <associateCourseReserveShelving>true</associateCourseReserveShelving>
2017-03-17 13:38:36	keveloper	    <shelvingLocationInput>CR Shelving Location</shelvingLocationInput>
2017-03-17 13:38:39	keveloper	also did we merge yet
2017-03-17 13:39:06	na_th_an	idk if we merged
2017-03-17 13:39:14	na_th_an	and I think so?
2017-03-17 13:39:44	keveloper	shouldn't it really just be shelvingLocation
2017-03-17 13:39:50	keveloper	should we change that
2017-03-17 13:39:54	keveloper	or nah
2017-03-17 13:39:54	na_th_an	what
2017-03-17 13:40:01	na_th_an	why would it just be "shelvingLocation"
2017-03-17 13:40:04	keveloper	the word input there makes no sense
2017-03-17 13:40:04	na_th_an	that doesn't make any sense
2017-03-17 13:40:11	na_th_an	oh
2017-03-17 13:40:20	keveloper	its an input in the dom but the thing being stored is the shelving location
2017-03-17 13:40:25	na_th_an	if anything it should be like "courseReserveShelvingLocation"
2017-03-17 13:40:28	keveloper	yeah
2017-03-17 13:40:31	na_th_an	idc
2017-03-17 13:40:31	keveloper	should we change that
2017-03-17 13:40:32	keveloper	i agree
2017-03-17 13:40:35	keveloper	eh
2017-03-17 13:40:38	keveloper	its a bit of work
2017-03-17 13:40:41	keveloper	plus jinbin
2017-03-17 13:40:43	keveloper	lets keep it
2017-03-17 13:40:46	na_th_an	bryan approved it
2017-03-17 13:40:48	keveloper	k

2017-03-17 13:40:52	na_th_an	idk
2017-03-17 13:41:02	keveloper	merging
2017-03-17 13:43:41	keveloper	I was gonna tell harika she should change RelatorList to implement Iterable so she could do for relator in relatorList but then i thought about it and was like... nah
2017-03-17 13:44:10	na_th_an	she'd be 
2017-03-17 13:44:16	na_th_an	she'd be like "what is Iterable?"
2017-03-17 13:44:23	keveloper	probably
2017-03-17 13:44:31	na_th_an	"I've never implemented an interface before"
2017-03-17 13:44:34	keveloper	lol
2017-03-17 13:44:36	na_th_an	"do I use extends?"

2017-03-20 11:34:21	na_th_an	yeah I have a pretty low opinion of her as ux directory
2017-03-20 11:34:23	keveloper	i said
2017-03-20 11:34:23	na_th_an	tbh
2017-03-20 11:34:25	keveloper	I mean if you type "su:dog" or clicked on "dog in Subject" on the previous page and see "su:dog" in the search bar, and the suggestions all begin with "dog" wouldn't the user know that the suggestion is for the term "dog" and would use the existing index?
2017-03-20 11:34:39	keveloper	binaebi said 
2017-03-20 11:34:51	keveloper	no. i didn’t assume that, and cathy didn’t assume that, and we’re fairly intelligent people who notice patterns
2017-03-20 11:35:05	keveloper	then you are stupid?
2017-03-20 11:35:21	keveloper	i dont understand how you can argue the intuitiveness of that
2017-03-20 11:35:26	keveloper	you type in su:dog
2017-03-20 11:35:33	na_th_an	not only is she acting stupid but saying something very sarcasticly to you
2017-03-20 11:35:34	keveloper	and there's a completion "dogville"
2017-03-20 11:35:56	keveloper	OBVIOUSLY THATS FOR THE WORD DOG THAT YOU TYPED IN
2017-03-20 11:36:08	na_th_an	yeah pretty much
2017-03-20 11:36:32	keveloper	i don't believe that she's that good at ux
2017-03-20 11:37:09	na_th_an	I don't think she is
2017-03-20 11:37:23	na_th_an	I legit think that abby would be as good at her job as she is
2017-03-20 11:37:37	keveloper	ya

2017-03-24 14:38:35	na_th_an	and she's going to say no because she wants to be management
2017-03-24 14:38:39	keveloper	before i came back from tires?
2017-03-24 14:38:40	na_th_an	she's never going to be a dev

2017-03-24 14:39:04	na_th_an	she thinks that she can get to management faster if she stays in her current position
2017-03-24 14:39:12	na_th_an	and tries to get a promotion there
2017-03-24 14:39:17	na_th_an	bc rashmi won't be as into  her career advancement

2017-03-24 14:39:48	na_th_an	I think she thinks she won't be very good at it and doesn't want to have to try harder than she is rn
2017-03-24 14:39:53	na_th_an	and she knows her job is way easier than ours 
2017-03-24 14:40:00	na_th_an	it's way more boring

2017-04-04 12:53:47	keveloper	oh yeah quarterly
2017-04-04 12:54:03	na_th_an	their schedules seem to be much more lax
2017-04-04 12:54:08	na_th_an	from talking to them

2017-04-04 12:54:31	keveloper	also im seeming to learn that the lazy people dislike rashmi
2017-04-04 12:54:35	na_th_an	we get a lot more pressure from upper management than other teams
2017-04-04 12:54:39	na_th_an	and ya that's definitely a thing

2017-04-04 12:54:49	na_th_an	she does some things that bother me 
2017-04-04 12:54:51	keveloper	i got used to it and also she's not been as bad
2017-04-04 12:54:54	na_th_an	she's fine
2017-04-04 12:54:55	keveloper	and also #getOverIt
2017-04-04 12:55:02	keveloper	she does do dumb shit tho still
2017-04-04 12:55:06	keveloper	but im like w/e she's a manager
2017-04-04 12:55:17	keveloper	she's really latched onto that database schema
2017-04-04 13:29:45	keveloper	too much passion chill out
2017-04-04 13:32:25	na_th_an	other people don't have any passion at all
2017-04-04 13:32:28	na_th_an	so I have to make up for them
2017-04-04 13:32:44	keveloper	i have passino
2017-04-04 13:32:46	keveloper	passinoooo
2017-04-04 13:32:54	na_th_an	i didn't say nobody
2017-04-04 13:33:05	keveloper	I HAVE THE PASSION
2017-04-04 14:55:30	keveloper	ugh
2017-04-04 14:55:37	keveloper	i disagree with a lot of things binaebi does
2017-04-04 14:55:40	keveloper	http://al9eci.axshare.com/#p=relevancy_and_scoping&g=1
2017-04-04 14:55:47	keveloper	look at the worldcat discovery scoping part
2017-04-04 14:55:49	keveloper	and the note
2017-04-04 14:55:53	keveloper	and how she structured it
2017-04-04 14:59:42	na_th_an	I'm confused
2017-04-04 14:59:53	na_th_an	how can you choose multiple defaults
2017-04-04 15:00:01	keveloper	because its not a radio in dui
2017-04-04 15:00:10	keveloper	you can select multiple
2017-04-04 15:00:17	na_th_an	select multiple what 
2017-04-04 15:00:21	keveloper	scopes
2017-04-04 15:00:32	na_th_an	so it should be Default Scoping Levels
2017-04-04 15:00:41	na_th_an	because there can be multiple defaults
2017-04-04 15:00:48	keveloper	well if she was good at her job yes it would be "levels"
2017-04-04 15:00:58	keveloper	is firefly donw
2017-04-04 15:01:00	na_th_an	so what are you saying is bad
2017-04-04 15:01:10	keveloper	that she wants the user to be able to select multiple
2017-04-04 15:01:20	keveloper	but then if you select libraries worldwide it deselects the others
2017-04-04 15:01:25	keveloper	but it just looks like a check list
2017-04-04 15:01:30	na_th_an	shouldn't it be like
2017-04-04 15:01:38	na_th_an	if you select libraries worldwide it checks the checkboxes
2017-04-04 15:01:39	keveloper	To different sections
2017-04-04 15:01:42	na_th_an	to show that you're getting all of them
2017-04-04 15:01:45	na_th_an	instead of unchecking them
2017-04-04 15:01:55	na_th_an	that just doesn't make sense
2017-04-04 15:02:13	keveloper	i dont know exactly what libraries worldwide means compared to all 3 levels
2017-04-04 15:02:13	keveloper	but
2017-04-04 15:02:25	keveloper	It should be like libraries worldwide first in a different section
2017-04-04 15:02:29	na_th_an	i think it's if it's held anywhere
2017-04-04 15:02:34	keveloper	and when you select it it disables the other checkboxes or something
2017-04-04 15:02:37	keveloper	not this
2017-04-04 15:02:49	keveloper	but its what she wants (for some reason)
2017-04-04 15:02:52	na_th_an	angela has a conflict so I'm going to this meeting without her
2017-04-04 15:02:58	keveloper	and she's too passive aggresive to approach about this stupid idea
2017-04-04 15:03:08	na_th_an	another instance of us attending meetings that normally architects go to
2017-04-04 15:03:15	na_th_an	dude I know
2017-04-04 15:03:24	na_th_an	it's impossible to go to them with any suggestions
2017-04-04 15:03:32	keveloper	"NO ITS MY UX"
2017-04-04 15:03:36	keveloper	"BAD DEVELOPER IS MY UX"
2017-04-04 15:03:45	keveloper	ITS*
2017-04-04 15:03:47	keveloper	get it
2017-04-04 15:03:55	na_th_an	"it works like that in other parts of DUI" "WELL THAT'S WRONG WE'RE FIXING THAT"
2017-04-04 15:04:11	keveloper	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yugoFc79uh8
2017-04-04 15:04:43	keveloper	the last line of that lololo
2017-04-04 15:08:54	na_th_an	can you imagine how much more motivated you'd be if accomplishing work quickly had some kind of payoff
2017-04-04 15:09:04	keveloper	like what
2017-04-04 15:09:24	na_th_an	like, you can dick around at work and barely do anything for 2-3 hours a day easy
2017-04-04 15:09:34	keveloper	oh yeah
2017-04-04 15:09:36	keveloper	true
2017-04-04 15:09:37	na_th_an	but like
2017-04-04 15:09:41	keveloper	i haven't been productive today
2017-04-04 15:09:49	keveloper	because i cant go DC to consitently show up in curry
2017-04-04 15:09:49	na_th_an	what if instead of that you could actually do the work you need to do for the day then go home
2017-04-04 15:10:19	na_th_an	there's just not a lot of motivation to get things done on a timely manner a lot of the time
2017-04-04 15:10:20	keveloper	this is ridiculous
2017-04-04 15:10:22	keveloper	yeah
2017-04-04 15:10:28	keveloper	i mean i do it because i care but
2017-04-04 15:10:37	na_th_an	ya I don't purposely dick around
2017-04-04 15:10:48	keveloper	ive dicked around today because discoveryconfig
2017-04-04 15:10:51	na_th_an	but sometimes it's hard to motivate when you know you have to be here until a certain time
2017-04-05 07:44:36	keveloper	i was on the comments of the cat getting pied in the face video
2017-04-05 07:44:50	keveloper	and someone was like "I can tell if this guy is 12 or 30, seriously guys help" or something
2017-04-05 07:45:04	keveloper	and the guy was like obviously 30 but i get where he got 12, guy had a young face
2017-04-05 07:45:16	keveloper	and someone commented
2017-04-05 07:45:48	keveloper	"I'm going to go with 12, because of the subject matter. Also, I expect that's his parents' cat, not his."
2017-04-05 07:46:01	keveloper	i thought 'wow this guy sounds miserable'
2017-04-05 07:46:07	keveloper	so i went to his profile
2017-04-05 07:46:34	keveloper	last comment before that: 'People say lowest common denominator when they clearly mean highest common factor. Grrrrrr.'
2017-04-05 07:46:40	keveloper	and i was like ok confirmed
2017-04-05 07:46:45	keveloper	and thats my story
2017-04-05 08:40:43	na_th_an	was that gothalice?

2017-04-05 08:47:59	na_th_an	I wonder what her blood test results were
2017-04-05 08:48:03	na_th_an	she said she was gonna get them on friday
2017-04-05 08:48:04	keveloper	i wonder
2017-04-05 08:48:05	keveloper	true
2017-04-05 08:48:07	na_th_an	and mentioned them a bunch of times
2017-04-05 08:48:12	na_th_an	but then never told us what it was
2017-04-05 08:50:40	na_th_an	i feel bad about how excited i am for mark to be off our team
2017-04-05 08:51:07	na_th_an	but then I think about how his new team is just now migrating to svn (??????)
2017-04-05 08:51:17	na_th_an	then I don't feel bad

2017-04-05 12:02:41	keveloper	the original thing i said was
2017-04-05 12:03:02	keveloper	I mean there's not really an opinion on it, you can't use vh to make something the full width because   │ beerdrop
2017-04-05 12:03:02	keveloper	                        | you don't know the aspect ratio of the window
2017-04-05 12:03:06	keveloper	sorry theres a user name in there
2017-04-05 12:03:15	keveloper	note: full width lol

2017-04-07 09:03:41	na_th_an	I'm getting really tired of how long our PR's are open too
2017-04-07 09:05:32	keveloper	ya its weird
2017-04-07 09:06:55	na_th_an	i feel like we need stronger leadership from our tech leads but they're too busy dealing with dumb meetings and rashmi and firstsearch bullshit 
2017-04-07 09:07:07	na_th_an	we could be doing a lot better with our pr's
2017-04-07 09:07:44	na_th_an	lol jimmy: "have you ever been to an authentic chinese restaurant" mark: "Once."

2017-04-07 09:10:23	na_th_an	if it takes 2 days for a feature team to do a code review then shit's going to take forever
2017-04-07 09:10:29	na_th_an	or we're going to have shitty code
2017-04-07 09:10:29	keveloper	becuase the one i didn't aprove was yings

2017-04-07 09:20:00	na_th_an	she's also pissed that ux sees us as employees here to implement their UX dreams
2017-04-07 09:20:02	na_th_an	her words
2017-04-07 09:20:19	na_th_an	apparently binaebi talked a bunch of shit about rashmi behind her back around the company too
2017-04-07 09:29:41	keveloper	they are both in the wrong and need to stop being annoying
2017-04-07 09:36:47	na_th_an	yeah
2017-04-07 09:37:20	na_th_an	rashmi was like "she was complaining about how I came late into a meeting then was looking at my phone, and then I looked up from my phone and talked very authoritively. I'm sorry, I used to be a director and I take charge!"
2017-04-07 09:37:32	na_th_an	after she was just telling me how I need to work on how I appear to people

2017-04-07 09:41:29	keveloper	that is meaningful
2017-04-07 09:41:31	keveloper	then rashim
2017-04-07 09:41:34	keveloper	will just like
2017-04-07 09:41:47	keveloper	smother in so much manager speak that i forgot what we were talking about

2017-04-07 09:42:14	keveloper	THE GHERKIN SHIT WAS NEVER FOR AUTOMATION
2017-04-07 09:42:16	na_th_an	I like how abby spends so many meetings fucking around on her computer
2017-04-07 09:42:16	keveloper	whre did that come from
2017-04-07 09:42:24	keveloper	its the fucking acceptance criteria in our tickets
2017-04-07 09:42:29	na_th_an	uhhh gherkin was definitely for automation
2017-04-07 09:42:35	na_th_an	apparentyl you didn't work here when that was a big issue
2017-04-07 09:42:42	keveloper	ok well when i've been here
2017-04-07 09:42:51	na_th_an	jim miller wanted every single acceptance criteria in gherkin and automated
2017-04-07 09:42:52	keveloper	the gherkin in the ticket is acceptance criteria
2017-04-07 09:42:54	na_th_an	and in a feature file
2017-04-07 09:43:08	na_th_an	with cucumber
2017-04-07 09:43:08	keveloper	that seems like kind of a good idea
2017-04-07 09:43:09	keveloper	but
2017-04-07 09:43:12	keveloper	oh not anymore
2017-04-07 09:43:16	keveloper	yoiu said cucmber and i was like oh nvm

2017-04-07 09:43:32	na_th_an	they wasted a ton of time and almost totally missed their deadline because of it
2017-04-07 09:43:32	keveloper	and spent more time writing tests than features?
2017-04-07 09:43:35	na_th_an	people had to work overtime
2017-04-07 09:43:36	keveloper	lolol
2017-04-07 09:43:44	keveloper	jimMiller++
2017-04-07 09:43:49	na_th_an	they spent all their time writing gherkin and trying to automate everything
2017-04-07 09:43:55	na_th_an	jim miller was pretty terrible from what I can tell
2017-04-07 09:43:56	keveloper	"i heard tdd is good so 100% lets do it go"
2017-04-07 11:21:43	na_th_an	but ya steven and abby were flirting super hard over irc
2017-04-07 11:22:00	na_th_an	like if I were her "bf" and saw that convo I would be very uncomfortable 
2017-04-07 11:26:20	keveloper	rly
2017-04-07 11:26:22	keveloper	what was it like
2017-04-07 11:26:38	keveloper	next time me and abby are alone i wanna be like

2017-04-07 11:27:04	na_th_an	she used to talk to me about pining over him
2017-04-07 11:27:08	keveloper	i'm gonna be like "HAH right"
2017-04-07 11:27:12	keveloper	pining
2017-04-07 11:27:17	na_th_an	I think they like each other but there's just no physical attraction so they don't do anything
2017-04-07 11:27:19	na_th_an	pine-ing
2017-04-07 11:27:25	keveloper	wtf is that
2017-04-07 11:27:52	na_th_an	"pine" like "pine tree" with an "ing" on the end
2017-04-07 11:28:07	na_th_an	'suffer a mental and physical decline, especially because of a broken heart.
2017-04-07 11:28:12	na_th_an	to pine

2017-04-07 12:57:02	keveloper	if i were stephen
2017-04-07 12:57:08	na_th_an	physical attraction is important
2017-04-07 12:57:18	keveloper	yeah
2017-04-07 12:57:27	na_th_an	unless you're asexual I guess

2017-04-07 12:58:16	na_th_an	maybe he's gay but doesn't want to admit it because of religion
2017-04-07 12:58:25	keveloper	maybe?
2017-04-07 12:58:28	keveloper	i don't think thats it
2017-04-07 12:58:32	na_th_an	I don't either
2017-04-07 12:58:35	na_th_an	but it's possible

2017-04-07 12:59:00	keveloper	like if you really like everything about them except their size

2017-04-07 13:05:08	na_th_an	if I were a tech lead I would reject this and tell him to do the "MESS of codenarc fixes" in a separate PR
2017-04-07 13:05:25	na_th_an	we're bad at git 
2017-04-07 13:05:27	na_th_an	as a company
2017-04-07 13:05:31	keveloper	lol
2017-04-07 13:05:48	keveloper	idk how im supposed to review this
2017-04-07 13:05:49	na_th_an	this isn't even multiple commits in one PR
2017-04-07 13:05:59	keveloper	LOL
2017-04-07 13:06:01	keveloper	THIS IS ONE COMMIT
2017-04-07 13:06:02	na_th_an	and he changed formatting of a bunch of gradle shit to be different than what's in our other projects
2017-04-07 13:06:04	na_th_an	like
2017-04-07 13:06:06	na_th_an	:(
2017-04-07 13:06:12	keveloper	why is he doing thi
2017-04-07 13:06:39	na_th_an	there's a comment that says bryan and zach encouraged him to fix them I guess?
2017-04-07 13:06:41	keveloper	codenarc doesn't look at the build.gradle right.......
2017-04-07 13:06:45	na_th_an	nope
2017-04-07 13:06:50	na_th_an	he just ran autoformat over the maps
2017-04-07 13:06:50	keveloper	why did he do this
2017-04-07 13:07:02	keveloper	that is impossible to read
2017-04-07 13:07:06	keveloper	scroll down to the add at like 152
2017-04-07 13:07:09	keveloper	in the main gradle
2017-04-07 13:07:14	keveloper	literally impossible to read
2017-04-07 13:07:16	na_th_an	all I know is that if I'm making pull requests to another team's project I'm totally going to go and change hundreds of lines of formatting first thing
2017-04-07 13:07:19	na_th_an	yeah I saw that
2017-04-07 13:07:46	keveloper	why does he keep like dropping in on our team lol
2017-04-07 13:07:54	na_th_an	idk they're starting to do some shit for us
2017-04-07 13:07:56	na_th_an	idk what
2017-04-07 13:08:34	keveloper	this commit tho
2017-04-07 13:09:15	na_th_an	this kind of thing just makes me sad
2017-04-07 13:09:18	keveloper	he didn't even separate his ticket commit from his ton of codenarc shit commit
2017-04-07 13:09:23	na_th_an	yeah
2017-04-07 13:09:28	na_th_an	it's just one giant commit
2017-04-07 13:09:47	na_th_an	I'm not approving this
2017-04-07 13:09:49	keveloper	meh
2017-04-07 13:09:53	keveloper	I am of a mind that there should never be a CyclomaticComplexity, MethodCount or ClassSize codenarc warning on TEST files. If you disagree, let me know. 
2017-04-07 13:10:24	na_th_an	meh to "I'm not approving this"
2017-04-07 13:10:27	na_th_an	or meh to his comment
2017-04-07 13:10:33	keveloper	meh to the cyclomatic complexity part
2017-04-07 13:10:37	keveloper	method count idc
2017-04-07 13:10:40	keveloper	class size fine
2017-04-07 13:10:41	keveloper	for tests
2017-04-07 13:10:44	na_th_an	ya it should be high
2017-04-07 13:10:48	keveloper	not off
2017-04-07 13:10:52	na_th_an	higher than the main code
2017-04-07 13:10:54	na_th_an	but ya not off
2017-04-07 13:11:08	na_th_an	it should be high enough to break the build if you do something really stupid
2017-04-07 13:11:10	keveloper	method count and class size shouldnt be limited for tests tho i dont think
2017-04-07 13:11:12	keveloper	yea
2017-04-07 13:11:17	na_th_an	ya I agree
2017-04-07 13:11:48	keveloper	yeah idk what to do about this
2017-04-07 13:12:09	na_th_an	be sad
2017-04-07 13:12:14	keveloper	i guess
2017-04-07 13:12:33	na_th_an	yo
2017-04-07 13:12:36	na_th_an	check out my cubes
2017-04-07 13:12:39	keveloper	im not gonna be like "revert this commit, make a commit of the actual work, make another commit of the codenarc fixed, separate those code reviews"
2017-04-07 13:13:00	na_th_an	ya I'm not gonna be like that either
2017-04-07 13:13:04	na_th_an	but I wanna
2017-04-07 13:13:17	na_th_an	ya new class of cube theory????? wall biters
2017-04-07 15:05:27	keveloper	but he was so smart
2017-04-07 15:06:37	keveloper	literally the same second
2017-04-07 15:06:41	na_th_an	lolol
2017-04-07 15:09:37	na_th_an	after dealing with the shitty non-version-controlled stored procedures in the ae dashboard I'm going to need some serious convincing that they're a good idea
2017-04-07 15:09:50	na_th_an	I've heard quite a few people online say that stored procedures are shitty
2017-04-07 15:09:50	keveloper	yeah
2017-04-07 15:09:54	keveloper	yeah
2017-04-07 15:10:13	keveloper	well apparently you can write them in python and unit test them apparently
2017-04-07 15:10:18	keveloper	im sure you can version control them
2017-04-07 15:10:34	na_th_an	well yeah if you version control your schema then do migrations
2017-04-07 15:10:41	na_th_an	it's an extra step
2017-04-07 15:10:54	na_th_an	idk, putting business logic in the data bacekend seems wrong to me
2017-04-07 15:11:01	keveloper	Yeah business logic seems like it belong in a micro service
2017-04-07 15:12:21	keveloper	is business logic supposed to be in the model...
2017-04-07 15:12:25	keveloper	that doesn't even make sense
2017-04-07 15:12:50	na_th_an	*shrug*
2017-04-07 15:12:53	na_th_an	I sorta see what she means
2017-04-07 15:12:55	na_th_an	but
2017-04-07 15:12:58	keveloper	yeah i mean
2017-04-07 15:12:58	na_th_an	I don't think I agree
2017-04-07 15:12:59	keveloper	but WHY
2017-04-07 15:13:04	keveloper	there's no answer to WHY you would do that
2017-04-07 15:13:06	keveloper	like yeah it would work
2017-04-07 15:13:14	keveloper	but why is that better than the logic being in a service
2017-04-07 15:13:56	na_th_an	charles and jimmy have been working for like 2 weeks and never merged
2017-04-07 15:14:07	na_th_an	and now they're like "I merged your stuff and the build broke a bunch of stuff"
2017-04-07 15:14:17	keveloper	lol
2017-04-07 15:14:19	keveloper	idk man
2017-04-07 15:14:21	keveloper	i cant work
2017-04-07 15:14:25	keveloper	i havent done like anything today
2017-04-07 15:14:27	keveloper	:(
2017-04-07 15:14:30	na_th_an	I
2017-04-07 15:14:36	na_th_an	I have a PR that's been open for over two days :(
2017-04-07 15:14:43	na_th_an	I asked jimmy this morning and yesterday morning to review it
2017-04-07 15:14:45	na_th_an	sigh
2017-04-07 15:15:56	keveloper	i wonder how goth alice would contribute to the team
2017-04-07 15:16:07	keveloper	like maybe hard to work with sometimes but she seems very very knowledgable
2017-04-07 15:16:17	keveloper	and i'm sure she comes off worse in text than in person
2017-04-07 15:16:35	na_th_an	she'd be completely willing to call people out on bullshit in code reviews
2017-04-07 15:16:41	na_th_an	and say "no, go fix it"
2017-04-07 15:16:42	keveloper	omg thatd be amazing
2017-04-07 15:16:45	na_th_an	which is something our team kinda lacks
2017-04-07 15:16:47	keveloper	lets hire merkazu
2017-04-07 15:16:49	keveloper	lol
2017-04-07 15:16:52	keveloper	or kerrang
2017-04-07 15:16:58	keveloper	We have openinggggss
2017-04-07 15:17:04	na_th_an	lol
2017-04-07 15:17:18	keveloper	but really though if we got one of the java people from #webdev they'd probably be goodf
2017-04-07 15:17:32	na_th_an	yeah
2017-04-07 15:17:43	na_th_an	honestly anyone who hangs out in irc is going to be better than someone who doesn't
2017-04-07 15:17:55	na_th_an	simply by the fact that they're in IRC they show more interest than like 99.5% of coders
2017-04-07 15:18:05	keveloper	yeah
2017-04-07 15:18:21	na_th_an	assuming they aren't assholes or w/e
2017-04-07 15:19:30	keveloper	well ya
2017-04-07 15:19:38	keveloper	i like the peeps in #webdev
2017-04-07 15:19:52	na_th_an	ya they're pretty cool usually
2017-04-07 15:20:13	na_th_an	not much seems to happen in ##frontend

2017-04-07 15:20:38	keveloper	and talk about cuddling
2017-04-07 15:20:46	keveloper	not a lot of frontend happens in there
2017-04-07 15:20:53	keveloper	dude #css gets so toxic ugh
2017-04-07 15:21:02	na_th_an	yeah agree

2017-04-07 16:16:27	keveloper	and fucking around
2017-04-07 16:16:31	keveloper	very off topic spammy lol
2017-04-07 16:17:39	keveloper	oh ya it started because they were like \o     o/

2017-04-07 16:18:12	keveloper	and i was like "oh wow sry"
2017-04-07 16:18:20	na_th_an	'guy' is basically a gender neutral term
2017-04-07 16:18:27	keveloper	i know
2017-04-07 16:18:29	na_th_an	english doesn't have gender neutral terms so uhh
2017-04-07 16:18:31	keveloper	especially talking about an ascii thign
2017-04-07 16:18:32	na_th_an	sorry feminists 
2017-04-07 16:18:34	na_th_an	but 
2017-04-07 16:18:38	keveloper	person

2017-04-07 16:18:51	na_th_an	yeah there's some gender neutral
2017-04-07 16:18:53	na_th_an	but like
2017-04-07 16:19:00	na_th_an	there's no 'ihr' equiv in english
2017-04-07 16:19:06	na_th_an	'yall' is the closest we have
2017-04-07 16:19:12	keveloper	lol
2017-04-07 16:20:12	keveloper	any way
2017-04-07 16:20:16	keveloper	long story short

2017-04-07 16:20:24	keveloper	i replied joke
2017-04-07 16:20:33	na_th_an	and then shit exploded
2017-04-07 16:20:34	na_th_an	#ircdrama
2017-04-07 16:20:34	keveloper	someone else brought the fact that there are no girls in irc
2017-04-07 16:20:43	keveloper	and i was like "pff i can name 3 girls"
2017-04-07 16:20:48	keveloper	"and like .... 3123123 guys"
2017-04-07 16:20:53	keveloper	and apparently that is grounds for banning
2017-04-07 16:21:30	na_th_an	reminds me of how it's not pc to bring up that racism still exists
2017-04-07 16:21:39	na_th_an	yesterday at the ifla thing the dude from zimbabwe was talking 
2017-04-07 16:21:41	na_th_an	and he's like

2017-04-07 16:22:01	na_th_an	"the population of zimbabwe is 14.5 million. the rest of us are spread around the world.... you can guess why"
2017-04-07 16:22:07	na_th_an	and I'm like O_O SAVAGE

2017-04-07 16:27:24	keveloper	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-04-07 16:27:24	keveloper	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-04-07 16:27:24	keveloper	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-04-07 16:27:24	keveloper	¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2017-04-07 16:28:00	 *	na_th_an talks shit
2017-04-07 16:28:06	keveloper	oooo
2017-04-10 09:28:47	na_th_an	jimmy wrote some really ugly js
2017-04-10 09:28:53	keveloper	aw rip
2017-04-10 09:29:12	na_th_an	our frontend code is so bad :(
2017-04-10 09:29:29	keveloper	do we have friday off
2017-04-10 09:29:31	keveloper	no
2017-04-10 09:29:37	na_th_an	no
2017-04-10 09:29:39	na_th_an	I do
2017-04-10 09:29:48	na_th_an	hopefully anyway
2017-04-10 09:29:52	na_th_an	assuming no major prod issue
2017-04-10 09:30:37	keveloper	SAML_ERROR=Problem+processing+ACS+Response+in+IDM+Bridge
2017-04-10 09:30:38	keveloper	uh
2017-04-10 09:31:19	na_th_an	neat
2017-04-10 09:34:33	na_th_an	for things in the UI that are hidden by default
2017-04-10 09:34:42	na_th_an	do you think you should do "display:none" in the scss
2017-04-10 09:34:50	na_th_an	or put "class='hidden' in the markup
2017-04-10 09:34:53	keveloper	not if you dont have to
2017-04-10 09:35:03	keveloper	but the core ui hidden shit doesn't always work
2017-04-10 09:35:12	keveloper	because it is bad
2017-04-10 09:35:12	na_th_an	ignoring core ui bs
2017-04-10 09:35:15	keveloper	oh ok
2017-04-10 09:35:15	keveloper	no
2017-04-10 09:35:16	keveloper	lol
2017-04-10 09:35:24	na_th_an	I said "x or y"
2017-04-10 09:35:25	keveloper	i mean i'd prefer we just use the html5 hidden attribute but
2017-04-10 09:35:30	na_th_an	"no" is no an answer :p
2017-04-10 09:35:43	na_th_an	there's an html5 hidden attribute?
2017-04-10 09:35:43	keveloper	oh class hidden
2017-04-10 09:35:47	keveloper	um yes
2017-04-10 09:35:55	keveloper	<input type='blah' hidden>
2017-04-10 09:35:57	keveloper	<div hidden?
2017-04-10 09:36:00	keveloper	<div hidden>
2017-04-10 09:36:25	na_th_an	oh I didn't know that was part of the html spec
2017-04-10 09:36:29	na_th_an	neat
2017-04-10 09:36:31	keveloper	yeah i like it
2017-04-10 09:36:34	keveloper	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-04-10 09:36:50	keveloper	its how jquery hides and shows stuff
2017-04-10 09:36:58	keveloper	$('#blah').show()
2017-04-10 09:37:02	keveloper	$('#blah').remove()
2017-04-10 09:37:05	keveloper	adds and removes the hidden attribute
2017-04-10 09:37:06	na_th_an	no ya that's definitely the right way to do it
2017-04-10 09:37:20	keveloper	No fighting with css
2017-04-10 09:37:27	keveloper	its either hidden or not
2017-04-10 09:37:40	keveloper	core ui is so bad
2017-04-10 09:37:41	keveloper	you can do like
2017-04-10 09:37:43	na_th_an	yeah
2017-04-10 09:37:46	na_th_an	it's pretty awful
2017-04-10 09:37:49	keveloper	<div class="somecoreuiclass hidden">
2017-04-10 09:37:52	keveloper	and its not hidden
2017-04-10 09:37:59	na_th_an	I just can't believe that there's like, all these open source frontend tools
2017-04-10 09:38:05	na_th_an	with tons of development
2017-04-10 09:38:06	keveloper	because somecoreuiclass has display: inline-block; in it
2017-04-10 09:38:26	na_th_an	and instead of saying "let's leveraeg these hundreds of developers working on this without us paying"
2017-04-10 09:38:28	keveloper	and they probably just heard "!important is bad >:O"
2017-04-10 09:38:31	na_th_an	they said "let's do it all ourselves"
2017-04-10 09:38:35	keveloper	when !important has uses
2017-04-10 09:38:38	keveloper	like in hidden classes
2017-04-10 09:38:45	na_th_an	yay coreui
2017-04-10 10:11:19	na_th_an	design with ying is kinda painful
2017-04-10 10:15:05	keveloper	why
2017-04-10 10:15:07	keveloper	whatd she do
2017-04-10 10:16:51	na_th_an	just hard to communicate
2017-04-10 10:16:58	keveloper	ya
2017-04-10 10:17:01	keveloper	i wish i was in design
2017-04-10 10:17:01	keveloper	no
2017-04-10 10:17:09	keveloper	i am triage
2017-04-10 10:18:44	na_th_an	we haven't done any design yet
2017-04-10 10:20:24	keveloper	well im just sitting here with acid reflux looking at owc so
2017-04-10 10:20:38	na_th_an	you should talk to your dr about that
2017-04-10 10:21:33	na_th_an	it's taken me like 5 minutes to be like "the wireframe show X but that's not part of the AC, should that be part of the story?"
2017-04-10 10:22:45	na_th_an	we're going through every AC and being like "ok this should be bold"
2017-04-10 10:22:56	na_th_an	for literally 15 minutes now
2017-04-10 10:23:01	na_th_an	i'm dying
2017-04-10 10:23:45	keveloper	rip
2017-04-10 10:24:30	na_th_an	her iphoto thing keeps bouncing
2017-04-10 10:25:00	keveloper	lolol
2017-04-10 10:31:22	na_th_an	"I know you weren't in grooming for this but go do detailed design"
2017-04-10 10:31:30	na_th_an	sigh
2017-04-10 10:31:36	na_th_an	still haven't done 1 estimate
2017-04-10 10:35:28	na_th_an	she's going through every requirement and painstakingly describing it
2017-04-10 10:35:32	na_th_an	that's all we're doing
2017-04-10 10:35:46	keveloper	who is she
2017-04-10 10:35:52	na_th_an	ying
2017-04-10 10:36:11	keveloper	what else is she supposed to do
2017-04-10 10:36:37	keveloper	you mean like spending way too long on each requirement
2017-04-10 10:37:40	na_th_an	"we need to add call numbers to email. so you go here, there's call numbers. then this dropdown, there's email. the user gets email with records"
2017-04-10 10:38:00	na_th_an	we're not doing any design
2017-04-10 10:44:05	na_th_an	we're basically regrooming the stories without product
2017-04-10 10:44:22	na_th_an	this is bad
2017-04-10 10:44:23	na_th_an	bad process
2017-04-10 10:44:47	keveloper	be like 'k can we design now'
2017-04-10 10:45:16	na_th_an	it takes so long to explain something to ying
2017-04-10 10:52:44	na_th_an	sal == sour
2017-04-10 10:53:10	na_th_an	we haven't done one estimate 
2017-04-10 10:53:12	na_th_an	or any design

2017-04-11 11:11:09	keveloper	idk how many they support lol
2017-04-11 11:11:12	keveloper	but not this many
2017-04-11 11:11:19	keveloper	idk designing new things here can be fun
2017-04-11 11:11:21	keveloper	but then codenarc
2017-04-11 11:11:24	keveloper	and 100% coverage
2017-04-11 11:11:26	keveloper	wasted time
2017-04-11 11:11:30	keveloper	team meeting
2017-04-11 11:11:32	keveloper	dumb standup
2017-04-11 11:11:36	keveloper	team is too big
2017-04-11 11:11:42	keveloper	say a lot of things that never happen
2017-04-11 11:11:42	na_th_an	let's talk about stuff but never do anything about the problems we identify
2017-04-11 11:13:08	keveloper	devs cant follow processes
2017-04-11 11:13:15	keveloper	our product team is like 1 1/2 people
2017-04-11 11:13:18	keveloper	the 1 is jay
2017-04-11 11:13:33	na_th_an	yeah it's just really disappointing
2017-04-11 11:14:01	keveloper	hmmm
2017-04-11 11:14:01	keveloper	idk
2017-04-11 11:15:55	keveloper	hmmm
2017-04-11 11:16:34	keveloper	maybe because its just triage week idk
2017-04-11 11:17:40	na_th_an	bill's like "can any of the stories be estimated"
2017-04-11 11:17:44	na_th_an	and I want to be like "these aren't stories"
2017-04-11 11:18:31	keveloper	do you know how the quickbuild test report thjing works
2017-04-11 11:19:10	na_th_an	there's something in the config that looks for a file path I think
2017-04-11 11:19:18	na_th_an	junit.xml or something
2017-04-11 11:19:28	keveloper	i think that file path changed
2017-04-11 11:19:31	keveloper	with some gradle file changes
2017-04-11 11:19:36	keveloper	idk who changed it but
2017-04-11 11:21:11	na_th_an	probably me
2017-04-11 11:21:39	keveloper	integrationLive was added to the end of all the paths
2017-04-11 11:23:54	keveloper	>:O
2017-04-11 11:37:33	keveloper	honestly it'd be nice to get awway from our annoying managers
2017-04-11 11:45:05	keveloper	i texted my dad and said i was interested
2017-04-11 13:25:16	keveloper	yeah i know ying
2017-04-11 13:25:22	na_th_an	lol same
2017-04-11 13:25:26	keveloper	i know you were talking about something completely unrealted lol
2017-04-11 13:25:35	na_th_an	yeah that's like all of the design meetings with her
2017-04-11 13:25:39	keveloper	lol
2017-04-11 13:25:40	na_th_an	there's very little communication happening
2017-04-11 13:25:47	na_th_an	it's very frustrating and exhuasting
2017-04-11 13:25:53	na_th_an	and I just feel bad :(
2017-04-11 13:27:14	keveloper	im editing a database this is weird
2017-04-11 13:27:25	keveloper	i could break so much shit with this right now
2017-04-11 13:27:38	keveloper	i could literally break WorldCat and get fired
2017-04-11 13:27:51	na_th_an	lol
2017-04-11 13:27:52	na_th_an	glgl
2017-04-11 13:28:09	keveloper	i could change one letter one of these fields and publish it to prod and no one would be able to search worldcat
2017-04-11 13:28:14	keveloper	how fired would i be
2017-04-11 13:28:18	na_th_an	would they know it was you
2017-04-11 13:28:35	keveloper	when someone found the issue they would see jen john's account did it
2017-04-11 13:28:45	keveloper	and jen john would be like "oh well i gave kevin holland my account info"
2017-04-11 13:28:51	na_th_an	she'd get fired
2017-04-11 13:28:56	na_th_an	blame he
2017-04-11 13:28:57	na_th_an	r

2017-04-11 13:29:12	keveloper	no jen john is good
2017-04-11 13:29:25	na_th_an	i just wanna see the world burn
2017-04-11 13:30:29	keveloper	why do none of our institutions match prod ugh
2017-04-11 13:30:53	keveloper	gotta go to fucking service config and add this stupid database god dammit
2017-04-11 13:30:55	keveloper	-_-
2017-04-11 13:55:04	keveloper	i think im gonna interview
2017-04-11 13:55:23	na_th_an	for M&T
2017-04-11 13:55:28	na_th_an	or for other shit
2017-04-11 13:56:15	keveloper	M&T
2017-04-11 14:01:26	keveloper	OWC is really better than DUI
2017-04-11 14:01:27	keveloper	it is
2017-04-11 14:01:39	keveloper	i'm using it right now
2017-04-11 14:01:42	keveloper	and it's older ya
2017-04-11 14:01:45	keveloper	and it doesn't look at good
2017-04-11 14:01:48	keveloper	but it has a ton features DUI doesn't
2017-04-11 14:01:59	keveloper	i just did an advanced search
2017-04-11 14:02:05	keveloper	and it had a preloader
2017-04-11 14:02:09	keveloper	and it said "Searching"
2017-04-11 14:02:12	keveloper	and it was like
2017-04-11 14:02:22	na_th_an	yeah
2017-04-11 14:02:26	keveloper	"Stop searching and show me the results so far"
2017-04-11 14:02:30	na_th_an	in a lot of user-facing ways it looks better
2017-04-11 14:02:30	keveloper	and i was like wow thats cool
2017-04-11 14:02:32	keveloper	and i clicked it
2017-04-11 14:02:41	keveloper	and sure enough it stopped searching and showed me results
2017-04-11 14:04:36	na_th_an	but discovery is better because it has 100% code coverage 
2017-04-11 14:05:02	keveloper	like wtf is up with our database selector
2017-04-11 14:05:11	keveloper	you select the boxes then hit save changes wtf is that
2017-04-11 14:05:34	na_th_an	it's awful
2017-04-11 14:05:40	na_th_an	but it takes too long to change anything
2017-04-11 14:05:42	na_th_an	because our shit code
2017-04-11 14:05:44	na_th_an	and shit tests
2017-04-11 14:05:50	na_th_an	and shit rules we have
2017-04-11 14:05:51	na_th_an	sigh
2017-04-11 14:07:03	keveloper	there's a ton of sql exception in owc
2017-04-11 14:13:11	keveloper	abby just got an amazon gift card for $140 because she returned the bluetooth speakear or whatever
2017-04-11 14:15:31	na_th_an	lol
2017-04-11 14:55:41	keveloper	do you think i can make this marc record test not shitty
2017-04-11 14:57:30	na_th_an	if anyone can it's you or me
2017-04-11 15:20:56	keveloper	and: 'do one more search for better marc record retrieving'
2017-04-11 15:20:57	keveloper	what lol
2017-04-11 15:21:11	keveloper	lol
2017-04-11 15:21:19	na_th_an	yeah, ying made that change
2017-04-11 15:22:08	keveloper	so gross
2017-04-11 15:22:12	na_th_an	yup
2017-04-11 15:22:17	na_th_an	i'm sad that we merged that
2017-04-11 15:22:24	na_th_an	no reason for that
2017-04-11 15:22:36	na_th_an	sigh.......
2017-04-11 15:30:38	keveloper	we did?
2017-04-11 15:30:39	keveloper	rip
2017-04-11 15:30:52	keveloper	if only i can figure out what institution im logged into so i can log out
2017-04-11 15:30:56	na_th_an	idk did we? 
2017-04-11 15:31:02	keveloper	yes we did
2017-04-11 15:31:02	na_th_an	you were looking at it so I assumed we did
2017-04-11 15:31:03	keveloper	i hate idm
2017-04-11 15:31:19	keveloper	i honestly have no idea where im signed in
2017-04-11 15:31:23	keveloper	but i cant sign in anywhere else
2017-04-11 15:31:48	na_th_an	idk dev is just fucked up on my computer
2017-04-11 15:31:53	na_th_an	I have to go into private browsing to do anything
2017-04-11 15:31:56	na_th_an	idk why
2017-04-11 16:39:36	keveloper	this job would entail learning perl
2017-04-11 17:07:43	keveloper	ying coded this test poorly
2017-04-11 17:07:47	keveloper	        descriptionTab.click()
2017-04-11 17:07:54	keveloper	so sometimes the tab gets closed lol
2017-04-11 17:08:57	keveloper	also the job requires learning perl
2017-04-11 17:09:01	keveloper	learning stuff about isoft
2017-04-11 17:09:07	keveloper	and UI stuff for the dashboard
2017-04-11 17:09:10	keveloper	hmm
2017-04-11 17:09:22	keveloper	i just farted and it smells like sulfur
2017-04-11 17:09:32	keveloper	i think its flamable
2017-04-11 17:10:05	keveloper	i wonder if its actually possible to light a fart on fire
2017-04-11 17:10:09	keveloper	has that been done
2017-04-11 17:10:24	na_th_an	yeah it is
2017-04-11 17:10:34	na_th_an	for a long time I thought it wasn't
2017-04-11 17:10:37	na_th_an	but I'm pretty sure it is
2017-04-11 17:10:38	na_th_an	not always
2017-04-11 17:10:41	na_th_an	but sometimes
2017-04-11 17:10:49	keveloper	it seems like people have done it
2017-04-11 17:11:18	na_th_an	i'm going tf home
2017-04-11 17:11:37	keveloper	lol
2017-04-11 17:11:40	keveloper	im gonna leave with u
2017-04-11 17:11:42	keveloper	dont be mad
2017-04-12 08:43:55	keveloper	this test that ying wrote is like
2017-04-12 08:43:55	keveloper	bad
2017-04-12 08:44:01	keveloper	defensive programming galore
2017-04-12 08:44:02	na_th_an	the marc record test?
2017-04-12 08:44:04	keveloper	yeah
2017-04-12 08:44:07	na_th_an	it was already bad
2017-04-12 08:44:14	na_th_an	and nobody on this team knows how to write good automation
2017-04-12 08:44:16	keveloper	she wrote a method called "signOutFromOtherTestedInstitutions()"
2017-04-12 08:44:18	na_th_an	except you and i and maybe zach
2017-04-12 08:44:23	keveloper	that just ried to log out of 91475 and 129026
2017-04-12 08:44:30	na_th_an	she said that helped
2017-04-12 08:44:33	na_th_an	which I believe her
2017-04-12 08:44:36	na_th_an	because our tests are shit
2017-04-12 08:44:53	keveloper	shouldn't everything start with a fresh session/cookies
2017-04-12 08:45:12	keveloper	so the login thing shouldn't be an issue
2017-04-12 08:45:47	na_th_an	you'd think
2017-04-12 08:45:49	na_th_an	but maybe not
2017-04-12 08:45:54	na_th_an	because our tests are shit
2017-04-12 08:45:57	keveloper	hmm
2017-04-12 08:46:04	na_th_an	that should be what ying investigated
2017-04-12 08:46:08	na_th_an	and fixed if that's an issue
2017-04-12 08:46:20	keveloper	yeah this shouldn't be in this test
2017-04-12 08:46:32	na_th_an	but when I said "let's move page specific logic to the page object instead of reimplementing it in every spec" and got shut down I kinda gave up
2017-04-12 08:46:33	keveloper	and if the test fails sometimes because of that then we should fix the actual issue not this
2017-04-12 08:46:39	na_th_an	right
2017-04-12 08:47:05	keveloper	the trying it twice thing is ridiculous
2017-04-12 08:47:10	na_th_an	yeah
2017-04-12 08:47:11	keveloper	i haven't had it not work for me even once
2017-04-12 08:47:15	na_th_an	that's really really really bad bad
2017-04-12 08:47:18	keveloper	except on the farm but
2017-04-12 08:47:19	keveloper	lol
2017-04-12 08:47:19	na_th_an	she says that it doesn't work through qb
2017-04-12 08:47:24	na_th_an	but works locally
2017-04-12 08:47:28	na_th_an	idk if she tried to run it from the host
2017-04-12 08:47:33	na_th_an	that's what I did when I was working on those
2017-04-12 08:47:37	na_th_an	I'd ssh into testingeus
2017-04-12 08:47:40	keveloper	well that'd be why
2017-04-12 08:47:42	na_th_an	and clone dui
2017-04-12 08:47:50	keveloper	she didn't do that
2017-04-12 08:47:50	na_th_an	and run it from there
2017-04-12 08:47:59	na_th_an	yeah probably not
2017-04-12 08:48:01	na_th_an	why would she
2017-04-12 08:48:04	na_th_an	nobody told her to
2017-04-12 08:48:21	keveloper	it depends on how qb runs it
2017-04-12 08:49:21	keveloper	k so its using discoveryui-m1.dev.oclc.org
2017-04-12 09:03:20	na_th_an	rashmi asked me how you were yesterday
2017-04-12 09:03:24	na_th_an	and i said you were fine
2017-04-12 09:03:36	na_th_an	she's like "does he complain about anything" or something like that
2017-04-12 09:03:44	na_th_an	and I'm like "we just complain about how firefly sucks"
2017-04-12 09:03:46	na_th_an	and she laughed 
2017-04-12 09:04:07	keveloper	that's weird
2017-04-12 09:04:10	na_th_an	and i'm like "it makes us feel bad when you make a nice ui but it's really slow or the autosuggestions are bad because firefly is bad"
2017-04-12 09:04:19	na_th_an	she said the replacement was greenlit like two days ago
2017-04-12 09:04:30	na_th_an	it wasn't a weird laugh
2017-04-12 09:04:30	keveloper	oh im sure it'll be _great_
2017-04-12 09:04:58	keveloper	she might be talking about how i told bill i thought i was under valued
2017-04-12 09:05:09	keveloper	i'm assuming bill told her? idk
2017-04-12 09:05:10	na_th_an	well you are
2017-04-12 09:05:19	keveloper	if that counts as complaining then byyyyeeeee
2017-04-12 09:05:29	keveloper	why else would she ask you that
2017-04-12 09:05:29	na_th_an	no she was just wondering how you are
2017-04-12 09:05:31	na_th_an	she does that a lot
2017-04-12 09:05:32	keveloper	rly tho
2017-04-12 09:05:35	na_th_an	ya

2017-04-12 09:22:02	keveloper	it might be fixed now though
2017-04-12 09:22:59	keveloper	yeah it might have something to do with why we couldn't get remote databases yesterday
2017-04-12 09:23:00	keveloper	idk
2017-04-12 09:23:16	na_th_an	idk
2017-04-12 09:23:18	na_th_an	idc
2017-04-12 09:41:23	na_th_an	sometimes I wonder what bryan does most days
2017-04-12 09:41:43	na_th_an	I know he jokes that he doesn't do anything because he attends meetings
2017-04-12 09:41:53	na_th_an	but I literally have no idea what he's doing most of the time
2017-04-12 09:45:22	keveloper	yeah sam,e
2017-04-12 09:55:32	na_th_an	rashmi keeps talking about how bad it is that nobody told management how awful mark was
2017-04-12 09:55:43	na_th_an	and how our team never holds people accountable
2017-04-12 09:55:52	na_th_an	and this shit with dave's team is exactly what she's talking about
2017-04-12 09:56:43	keveloper	i don't really feel like like telling a bunch of grade 17+ what to do
2017-04-12 09:57:01	na_th_an	yeah
2017-04-12 09:57:03	na_th_an	same
2017-04-12 09:57:08	na_th_an	that's why you just ask
2017-04-12 09:57:16	na_th_an	"why is this going to master? I thought our process was _____"
2017-04-12 09:57:44	keveloper	idk but a ton of shit just got like mass merged
2017-04-12 09:57:50	keveloper	now there's only 5 open and they are to master
2017-04-12 09:58:20	keveloper	oh jk i lied
2017-04-12 10:18:04	na_th_an	patrick's basically telling bill to get fucked with deploying firstsearhc to prt
2017-04-12 10:18:14	na_th_an	"we're not going to update self service for this"
2017-04-12 10:18:17	na_th_an	"self service is divest"
2017-04-12 10:18:28	na_th_an	well firstsearch has been divest for 10 years but we still have to support that bullshit
2017-04-12 10:40:43	na_th_an	 wonder if discovery parity being over budget means that we won't get promotions because people put numbers into peoplesoft
2017-04-12 10:44:03	keveloper	yeah
2017-04-12 10:44:05	keveloper	probably
2017-04-12 10:44:44	na_th_an	next time rashmi decides to pull me into a meeting room at the end of the day for half an hour I'll ask her
2017-04-12 10:44:52	keveloper	There seems to be a flaw in your git strategy.
2017-04-12 10:44:55	keveloper	fuck off dave seriously
2017-04-12 10:45:00	na_th_an	yeah seriously
2017-04-12 10:45:18	keveloper	he is literally blind
2017-04-12 10:45:22	keveloper	DA-3 gets merged to master
2017-04-12 10:45:24	keveloper	very clearly
2017-04-12 10:45:24	na_th_an	he could maybe ask
2017-04-12 10:45:26	na_th_an	be like
2017-04-12 10:45:31	na_th_an	"I'm probably missing something"
2017-04-12 10:45:33	na_th_an	but no
2017-04-12 10:45:37	na_th_an	there's a flaw in our strat
2017-04-12 10:45:45	na_th_an	he couldn't be missing something or not understanding
2017-04-12 10:46:11	keveloper	Also, what’s weird is that integration just stops in the graph.
2017-04-12 10:46:15	keveloper	because we delete
2017-04-12 10:46:15	keveloper	it
2017-04-12 10:46:17	keveloper	god
2017-04-12 10:46:17	keveloper	dammit
2017-04-12 10:46:32	na_th_an	it's too hard to ask "why does integration stop?"
2017-04-12 10:46:35	na_th_an	it's gotta be an error
2017-04-12 10:46:40	keveloper	Local tracked branches of integration would then point to old remotes and they’d need to be cleaned up.
2017-04-12 10:46:55	keveloper	good point
2017-04-12 10:46:58	na_th_an	yeah
2017-04-12 10:47:05	na_th_an	I've been wondering what'll happen with that
2017-04-12 10:47:09	na_th_an	but I figure we'll deal with it when it happens
2017-04-12 10:47:14	na_th_an	maybe it won't work
2017-04-12 10:47:18	na_th_an	we'll iterate on the process
2017-04-12 10:47:20	na_th_an	that's ok
2017-04-12 10:51:55	na_th_an	I feel like this is an email chain of salpicon circlejerking around us
2017-04-12 10:53:14	na_th_an	where are our tech leads
2017-04-12 10:53:28	keveloper	idfk
2017-04-12 10:53:32	keveloper	drinking kale juice
2017-04-12 10:53:40	na_th_an	we really need some stronger leadership on this team
2017-04-12 10:58:22	keveloper	shouldnt have bryan explained our dev process to them
2017-04-12 10:58:25	keveloper	when they were like
2017-04-12 10:58:27	keveloper	"hey"
2017-04-12 10:58:28	na_th_an	yes
2017-04-12 10:58:30	na_th_an	yes he should have
2017-04-12 10:58:34	keveloper	"we are gonna start making changes"
2017-04-12 10:58:36	na_th_an	I'm 100% sure that dave asked bryan
2017-04-12 10:58:37	na_th_an	he had to
2017-04-12 10:58:39	na_th_an	they talk all the time
2017-04-12 10:59:03	na_th_an	bryan is too nice sometimes
2017-04-12 10:59:16	na_th_an	he's like the polar opposite of jb
2017-04-12 10:59:19	na_th_an	in some ways
2017-04-12 10:59:33	keveloper	i hear silas and dave talking about our git flow now
2017-04-12 10:59:43	na_th_an	this is toxic
2017-04-12 10:59:52	keveloper	"what happens if"
2017-04-12 10:59:55	keveloper	i heard
2017-04-12 10:59:57	keveloper	ccome ask us
2017-04-12 11:00:00	keveloper	we will tell you
2017-04-12 11:00:08	keveloper	because 8 devs sat around a table for like 3 hours to figure this out
2017-04-12 11:00:30	na_th_an	i wonder if they assume we're all as good as mark
2017-04-12 11:00:32	keveloper	after noticing our existing workflow for 6 months had issues
2017-04-12 11:00:36	keveloper	idk
2017-04-12 11:00:43	keveloper	do i really wanna go back to subversion
2017-04-12 11:00:56	na_th_an	migrate them to git bro
2017-04-12 11:01:09	keveloper	they dont know git
2017-04-12 11:01:14	keveloper	it would probably do more harm than good
2017-04-12 11:01:19	na_th_an	yeah probably lol
2017-04-12 11:01:29	keveloper	only like 2 people work on the repo though
2017-04-12 11:01:42	keveloper	this team is too big
2017-04-12 11:01:46	keveloper	like way too big
2017-04-12 11:01:52	keveloper	and now more people are coming
2017-04-12 11:01:52	na_th_an	yeah it is
2017-04-12 11:01:58	keveloper	and we are hiring two new people
2017-04-12 11:02:06	keveloper	and it will get worse
2017-04-12 11:02:09	na_th_an	we were already lacking proper tech lead resources to do pull requests and code reviews
2017-04-12 11:02:15	na_th_an	and now it's gonna get way worse
2017-04-12 11:02:18	na_th_an	"why is our quality bad"
2017-04-12 11:02:20	na_th_an	"why are we over budget"
2017-04-12 11:05:14	keveloper	i can't decide if i wanna leave this team or not
2017-04-12 11:08:05	keveloper	uhhh
2017-04-12 11:24:01	keveloper	if merge conflicts exist cant you just do
2017-04-12 11:24:11	keveloper	wait yeah thats an issue
2017-04-12 11:24:13	na_th_an	you would checkout integration
2017-04-12 11:24:16	na_th_an	pull your branch
2017-04-12 11:24:18	na_th_an	push
2017-04-12 11:24:22	na_th_an	delete integration from local
2017-04-12 11:24:30	keveloper	would that worok
2017-04-12 11:24:32	na_th_an	ya
2017-04-12 11:24:37	na_th_an	why wouldn't it
2017-04-12 11:24:41	keveloper	there could still be conflicts right
2017-04-12 11:24:43	na_th_an	ya
2017-04-12 11:24:48	na_th_an	that's why you checkout integration
2017-04-12 11:24:50	na_th_an	and pull
2017-04-12 11:24:53	keveloper	resolved locally
2017-04-12 11:24:56	na_th_an	ya
2017-04-12 11:25:07	na_th_an	in between "pull" and "push"
2017-04-12 11:25:09	na_th_an	you resolve conflicts
2017-04-12 11:28:34	keveloper	k if you have questions after my email fuck off
2017-04-12 11:29:47	keveloper	"We're trying to understand how it differs from gitflow"
2017-04-12 11:29:49	keveloper	LARGELY
2017-04-12 11:29:51	keveloper	rtfm
2017-04-12 11:30:34	keveloper	i can't decide if i should leave
2017-04-12 11:30:57	na_th_an	idk man
2017-04-12 14:15:25	na_th_an	did you see in slack
2017-04-12 14:15:36	na_th_an	apparently ying merged the integration branch into her regression branch
2017-04-12 14:15:41	na_th_an	and that's why there's so much bullshit in there
2017-04-12 14:15:47	keveloper	oh
2017-04-12 14:15:48	keveloper	um
2017-04-12 14:15:49	keveloper	decline
2017-04-12 14:15:50	na_th_an	bryan was like "no I can't merge this"
2017-04-12 14:16:01	na_th_an	we said so many times "Never merge integration into anything"
2017-04-12 14:16:02	na_th_an	multiple times
2017-04-12 14:16:04	na_th_an	explicitly
2017-04-12 14:16:09	na_th_an	"Integration never gets merged into anything"
2017-04-12 14:16:10	na_th_an	we drew a picture

2017-04-17 14:36:04	na_th_an	how much is the cheapest 61 key that's worth buying
2017-04-17 14:43:52	keveloper	do you want a controller or keyboard
2017-04-17 14:45:36	na_th_an	uhhh
2017-04-17 14:45:40	na_th_an	idk
2017-04-17 14:46:09	keveloper	contoller's don't make noise
2017-04-17 14:46:24	keveloper	they send signals to a soft synth on your PC that makes noise
2017-04-17 14:46:34	na_th_an	oh
2017-04-17 14:46:36	keveloper	digital piano/synths are standalone
2017-04-17 14:46:37	na_th_an	uhhhh
2017-04-17 14:46:40	na_th_an	what do you think
2017-04-17 14:47:18	keveloper	i think most synths can double as a controller
2017-04-17 14:47:23	keveloper	controllers are cheaper
2017-04-17 14:47:26	keveloper	but you need software
2017-04-17 14:47:39	keveloper	but if you have a DAW and some synths/plugins then you have more freedom with what you can do
2017-04-17 14:47:40	na_th_an	is there open source software
2017-04-17 14:47:46	keveloper	uhhh yeah but most of it isn't great
2017-04-17 14:48:32	keveloper	soft synths are a little harder to use though
2017-04-17 14:48:49	keveloper	you need to know about oscilators and wave forms and ADSR and stuff
2017-04-17 14:48:53	keveloper	unless you only use presets
2017-04-17 14:49:24	keveloper	also its easy to torrent like FL Studio
2017-04-17 14:49:30	keveloper	also with stuff like that you can record things
2017-04-17 14:49:49	na_th_an	idk a keyboard sounds better maybe
2017-04-17 14:49:51	na_th_an	for starting
2017-04-17 14:49:54	keveloper	yeah maybe
2017-04-17 14:49:55	na_th_an	if i even do it
2017-04-17 14:50:05	keveloper	DAWs can be DAWnting
2017-04-17 14:50:06	keveloper	lol
2017-04-17 14:50:07	keveloper	get it
2017-04-17 14:50:34	na_th_an	what should I get
2017-04-17 14:51:03	keveloper	idk i havent looked at keyboards in like 8 years
2017-04-17 14:52:44	keveloper	a lot of the soft synths I use look liek this so: https://audioz.download/uploads/posts/2015-04/1430265136_psyn-ii.jpg
2017-04-17 14:53:02	keveloper	http://static.cakewalk.com/cakewalk/products/pentagon/Pentagon-I.png
2017-04-17 14:53:17	na_th_an	that doesn't look like a piano to me
2017-04-17 14:53:25	na_th_an	I want one of those things that looks kinda like a piano
2017-04-17 14:53:48	keveloper	http://www.truepianos.com/images/screenshots/truepianos_front.png
2017-04-17 14:53:56	na_th_an	lol
2017-04-17 14:53:58	keveloper	http://www.truepianos.com/images/screenshots/truepianos_adv.png
2017-04-17 14:54:07	keveloper	thats the basic interface of the truepianos
2017-04-17 14:54:46	keveloper	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-pKB3lZsfk
2017-04-17 14:54:48	na_th_an	I don't feel like anything happened in this meeting
2017-04-17 14:54:53	keveloper	truepianos sounds really good
2017-04-17 14:54:54	keveloper	i have it
2017-04-17 14:55:09	keveloper	BUT if you use a non weighted keyboard it sounds like trash
2017-04-17 14:55:32	keveloper	piano dynamics are very distinctive and its impossible to sound like a piano with a non weighted keyboard
2017-04-17 14:55:33	na_th_an	you aren't helping me at all
2017-04-17 14:55:35	na_th_an	lol
2017-04-17 14:55:35	keveloper	lol
2017-04-17 14:55:53	keveloper	either way softsynths can be pure piano softsynths and stand alone from DAWs
2017-04-17 14:55:54	na_th_an	it's like if I was like "I've never used a keyboard before, what do you guys recommend" in #mechboards
2017-04-17 14:56:04	keveloper	but either way get a keyboard
2017-04-17 14:56:06	na_th_an	and they're like "do you want linears or tactile"
2017-04-17 14:56:11	na_th_an	and I'm ilke "wtf is that"
2017-04-17 14:58:15	keveloper	get a digital pinao
2017-04-17 14:58:30	keveloper	unless you might want to do music production
2017-04-17 14:59:06	na_th_an	https://www.amazon.com/Casio-CTK2400-61-Portable-Keyboard/dp/B00JZEW3KC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1492455529&sr=8-1&keywords=digital+piano+61+key

2017-04-17 14:59:27	keveloper	sure
2017-04-17 14:59:30	keveloper	listen to a demo
2017-04-17 14:59:38	keveloper	to make sure it doesn't sound like trash
2017-04-17 15:00:21	keveloper	also idk what "dynamic touch keys" means
2017-04-17 15:00:25	keveloper	look for weighted
2017-04-17 15:02:08	keveloper	That one looks pretty good
2017-04-17 15:05:28	na_th_an	it's the first one that came up in my amazon search
2017-04-17 15:18:30	keveloper	i dont think thats weighted tho dont get it
2017-04-17 15:18:46	na_th_an	ok
2017-04-17 15:18:52	na_th_an	I'm probably not gonna get one soon
2017-04-17 15:18:53	na_th_an	but I want one
2017-04-17 15:23:24	na_th_an	this could be the last time mark ever fucks something up in discoveryui

2017-04-18 09:14:56	na_th_an	jimmy has still not done a single code review without me askinghim
2017-04-18 09:14:59	na_th_an	usually multiple times
2017-04-18 09:18:13	keveloper	god dammit
2017-04-18 09:18:26	keveloper	i just heard bridget say "how did this get missed" and brett was like "it was tested"

2017-04-19 10:38:05	na_th_an	max spin bro
2017-04-19 10:38:12	keveloper	wheres the throw part of that
2017-04-19 10:38:35	keveloper	i meant throw by like you kinda throw it forward when you launch it
2017-04-19 10:38:41	keveloper	and try to hit the other guy with more force
2017-04-19 10:38:50	keveloper	straight drop is when you just launch it straight down

2017-04-19 10:39:13	na_th_an	start level with the arena

2017-04-19 15:36:22	na_th_an	"Nathan! Can I talk to you?"
2017-04-19 15:36:23	na_th_an	and I'm like omg
2017-04-19 15:36:26	keveloper	lol
2017-04-19 15:36:26	keveloper	no
2017-04-19 15:36:30	keveloper	just be like 'no'
2017-04-19 15:36:46	keveloper	remember that really bad css BEM presentation we saw
2017-04-19 15:36:47	na_th_an	but im a good boi
2017-04-19 15:36:49	keveloper	at code mash
2017-04-19 15:36:56	na_th_an	oh yeah that was pretty bad
2017-04-19 15:37:08	na_th_an	although idk if bad is really the right word
2017-04-19 15:37:16	na_th_an	like the electron one was BAD
2017-04-19 15:37:20	keveloper	lmao
2017-04-19 15:37:26	na_th_an	that BEM one was like
2017-04-19 15:37:27	na_th_an	a thought
2017-04-19 15:37:31	na_th_an	it was a good thought
2017-04-19 15:37:35	na_th_an	but it was more of a thought than a presentation
2017-04-19 15:37:42	na_th_an	"I think this is cool"
2017-04-19 15:37:43	keveloper	well i mean BEM is widely used
2017-04-19 15:37:45	keveloper	lol
2017-04-19 15:37:46	keveloper	yeah
2017-04-19 15:37:52	na_th_an	it was too short to be a presentation
2017-04-19 15:37:59	na_th_an	whereas the electron guy was like "I need to fill time"
2017-04-19 15:38:05	na_th_an	but anyway
2017-04-19 15:38:08	na_th_an	was there more you wanted to say about it
2017-04-19 15:38:28	keveloper	nope
2017-04-19 15:38:29	keveloper	lol
2017-04-19 15:38:32	na_th_an	lol
2017-04-19 15:38:32	keveloper	memberrr
2017-04-19 15:38:36	na_th_an	ya i member
2017-04-19 15:38:37	keveloper	im super slouching

2017-04-19 15:58:33	na_th_an	the kibana 8 thing
2017-04-19 15:58:35	keveloper	hades something
2017-04-19 15:58:36	keveloper	LMAO
2017-04-19 15:58:41	keveloper	WE MADE IT TO KIBANA 5 THO LOL
2017-04-19 16:07:41	na_th_an	really struggling rn
2017-04-19 16:07:46	na_th_an	can't work
2017-04-19 16:07:48	na_th_an	just can't
2017-04-19 16:08:50	keveloper	ok so
2017-04-19 16:08:51	keveloper	help
2017-04-19 16:08:54	keveloper	im coming over
2017-04-19 16:16:50	na_th_an	mark is packing up
2017-04-19 16:16:51	na_th_an	rip
2017-04-19 16:17:01	keveloper	:(
2017-04-19 16:17:03	keveloper	kinda sad
2017-04-19 16:17:20	na_th_an	most companies would just fire him
2017-04-19 16:17:25	na_th_an	so not that sad
2017-04-19 16:17:30	keveloper	i guess so
2017-04-19 16:25:26	na_th_an	i've done so little this afternoon
2017-04-19 16:26:10	keveloper	me too
2017-04-19 16:26:10	keveloper	idc
2017-04-19 16:26:11	keveloper	w/e
2017-04-19 16:56:29	na_th_an	lol abby didn't know that gamer gate came from game journalism but complained about gamer gaters
2017-04-19 19:07:56	na_th_an	yt
2017-04-19 19:08:06	keveloper	ya hi
2017-04-19 19:08:07	keveloper	man
2017-04-19 19:08:09	keveloper	mad8
2017-04-19 19:08:37	na_th_an	did you do the stuff with pacman-key
2017-04-19 19:08:44	keveloper	trying
2017-04-19 19:08:56	keveloper	what guide are you talking about
2017-04-19 19:09:04	na_th_an	pacman-key --init
2017-04-19 19:09:06	na_th_an	pacman-key --populate archlinux
2017-04-19 19:09:08	na_th_an	pacman-key --refresh-keys
2017-04-19 19:09:10	na_th_an	did you do that
2017-04-19 19:09:23	keveloper	no hold on
2017-04-19 19:09:36	na_th_an	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman/Package_signing
2017-04-19 19:09:55	na_th_an	that wiki page should have all the answers
2017-04-19 19:11:46	keveloper	i just want to make a fucking cron job
2017-04-19 19:11:53	keveloper	why does cron not come on arch
2017-04-19 19:12:10	na_th_an	because it's a bare minimum install and you can install cron with one command
2017-04-19 19:12:15	na_th_an	because that's the Arch Way
2017-04-19 19:12:21	keveloper	yeah well i couldnt so
2017-04-19 19:12:34	keveloper	every time i've tried to use pacman i have to go through some bullshit
2017-04-19 19:13:04	na_th_an	that's because you only run it once every 6 months
2017-04-19 19:13:18	na_th_an	and usually there's a change that requires manual intervention every 6 months or so
2017-04-19 19:13:24	na_th_an	which is posted on the arch news
2017-04-19 19:13:28	keveloper	-_-
2017-04-19 19:13:33	keveloper	what should i run like Syu with a cron job
2017-04-19 19:13:36	na_th_an	because arch is rolling install for fastest updates
2017-04-19 19:13:51	na_th_an	you should just update more often ideally 
2017-04-19 19:13:59	keveloper	when im bored on a sunday
2017-04-19 19:14:03	keveloper	go run pacman -Syu
2017-04-19 19:14:05	na_th_an	it's not designed as a distro to not be updated often
2017-04-19 19:14:20	na_th_an	that's why it's great for desktops
2017-04-19 19:14:26	na_th_an	because you get the latest software
2017-04-19 19:14:44	na_th_an	I run pacman -Syu on all my arch computers all the time without problems
2017-04-19 19:14:45	keveloper	this pacman-key --init command is taking forever
2017-04-19 19:15:10	na_th_an	https://www.archlinux.org/news/ca-certificates-utils-20170307-1-upgrade-requires-manual-intervention/
2017-04-19 19:15:13	na_th_an	you'll have to do that
2017-04-19 19:15:46	keveloper	why
2017-04-19 19:16:06	na_th_an	because if you don't it'll say there's a file conflict with that file that they tell you to delete
2017-04-19 19:16:34	na_th_an	if you do a -Syu it'll fail in the checking file conflicts step
2017-04-19 19:16:40	na_th_an	which comes after the verifying package integrity step
2017-04-19 19:16:45	na_th_an	which is what you're fixing now
2017-04-19 19:16:53	keveloper	you have any idea why pacman-key --init is hanging
2017-04-19 19:17:02	na_th_an	no
2017-04-19 19:17:10	na_th_an	kill it and try again?
2017-04-19 19:17:13	keveloper	did
2017-04-19 19:17:21	na_th_an	oh
2017-04-19 19:17:27	na_th_an	For this initialization, entropy is required. Moving your mouse around, pressing random characters at the keyboard or running some disk-based activity (for example in another console running ls -R / or find / -name foo or dd if=/dev/sda8 of=/dev/tty7) should generate entropy. If your system does not already have sufficient entropy, this step may take hours; if you actively generate entropy, it will complete
2017-04-19 19:17:29	na_th_an	much more quickly.
2017-04-19 19:17:36	na_th_an	on the wiki page I linked
2017-04-19 19:17:42	keveloper	"key generation may take a very long time"
2017-04-19 19:17:46	na_th_an	Note: If you need to run pacman-key --init on computer that does not generate much entropy (e.g. a headless server), key generation may take a very long time. To generate pseudo-entropy, install either haveged or rng-tools on the target machine and start the corresponding service before running pacman-key --init.
2017-04-19 19:18:13	na_th_an	or just go to a terminal and type a bunch of shit
2017-04-19 19:18:16	keveloper	i'd love to but i cant install anything so
2017-04-19 19:18:16	na_th_an	on the server
2017-04-19 19:18:22	keveloper	this is that server
2017-04-19 19:18:24	na_th_an	you probably could but it might not work
2017-04-19 19:18:27	keveloper	what if i cat random
2017-04-19 19:18:30	na_th_an	yeah go bash the keyboard
2017-04-19 19:18:35	na_th_an	no that'd use up entropy I think
2017-04-19 19:18:41	na_th_an	user interaction creates entropy 
2017-04-19 19:18:42	keveloper	wtf is entropy
2017-04-19 19:18:47	na_th_an	randomness
2017-04-19 19:18:53	na_th_an	i don't really understand it
2017-04-19 19:19:03	keveloper	this is the dumbest thing i have ever done
2017-04-19 19:19:06	na_th_an	but like, yanno how most randomness isn't random
2017-04-19 19:19:14	na_th_an	it's seeded and then it's an algorithm
2017-04-19 19:19:26	na_th_an	entropy lets computers create true randomness for crpytography
2017-04-19 19:19:44	na_th_an	rather than relying on an algorithm to generate a "random" number from a seed
2017-04-19 19:20:02	na_th_an	it reads hardware that has "random" signals and craetes randomness from that
2017-04-19 19:20:43	keveloper	i shouldve put this in a tmux session
2017-04-19 19:20:43	na_th_an	you might be able to just do a pacman-key --refresh-keys
2017-04-19 19:20:44	keveloper	fuck
2017-04-19 19:21:12	keveloper	k
2017-04-19 19:21:31	keveloper	total: 23, unchanged: 23
2017-04-19 19:21:57	keveloper	dunno bout to give up
2017-04-19 19:22:05	na_th_an	pacman-key --populate archlinux
2017-04-19 19:22:10	keveloper	running already
2017-04-19 19:23:10	keveloper	idk w/e i give up
2017-04-19 19:23:30	keveloper	maybe when i have 3 hours to dedicate to install a package i'll come back to this
2017-04-19 19:23:37	na_th_an	have you never updated on this system
2017-04-19 19:23:51	keveloper	i did like literally last week or something
2017-04-19 19:24:39	na_th_an	then something probably got corrupted
2017-04-19 19:24:51	na_th_an	whenever that ovh shit was happening
2017-04-19 19:24:51	keveloper	ya dont say
2017-04-19 19:24:57	keveloper	huh
2017-04-19 19:25:04	na_th_an	weren't you having issues this morning
2017-04-19 19:25:07	na_th_an	ovhplz
2017-04-19 19:25:28	keveloper	that was just renewing
2017-04-19 19:26:05	na_th_an	pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring && pacman -Syyu
2017-04-19 19:26:14	na_th_an	is the first result when I google your error and the name "anthraxx"
2017-04-19 19:26:41	keveloper	this command is still running 
2017-04-19 19:27:03	na_th_an	what guides were you reading when you said you read every guide
2017-04-19 19:27:13	keveloper	idfk
2017-04-19 19:27:22	keveloper	i searched the error and ran some commands
2017-04-19 19:29:05	keveloper	will running aminecraft server generate entropy
2017-04-19 19:29:17	na_th_an	i don't think so
2017-04-19 19:29:24	keveloper	oh well
2017-04-19 19:47:15	keveloper	bskcx@aster.duckdns.org
2017-04-19 19:47:46	keveloper	nathanisbomb
2017-04-19 19:50:27	keveloper	oh lmao

2017-04-19 21:06:27	keveloper	idk
2017-04-19 21:06:29	keveloper	an assignment
2017-04-19 21:54:01	keveloper	i tried helping him
2017-04-19 21:54:19	keveloper	the code doesn't compile
2017-04-19 21:54:26	keveloper	which was why he couldn't copy that executeable
2017-04-19 21:54:36	keveloper	it didn't exist because make failed
2017-04-19 22:02:48	na_th_an	rip
2017-04-19 22:02:50	na_th_an	well
2017-04-19 22:02:54	na_th_an	you did a good thing trying
2017-04-19 22:02:55	keveloper	i think i solved it
2017-04-19 22:02:57	na_th_an	were you able to fix
2017-04-19 22:03:09	keveloper	idk yet he formatted sd card because he's format happy i guess
2017-04-19 22:03:22	keveloper	https://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar/issues/614
2017-04-19 22:03:44	keveloper	it was breaking on avcoded shit
2017-04-19 22:03:46	keveloper	codec
2017-04-19 22:03:58	keveloper	so i bet if he checks out the commit before that it will work
2017-04-19 22:13:25	na_th_an	I'm typing on haley's keyboard for the first time
2017-04-19 22:13:34	na_th_an	I glued everything on the back and screwed it back together
2017-04-19 22:13:45	na_th_an	and then there was a grounding issue against the case where the whole top row didn't work
2017-04-19 22:14:01	na_th_an	so I had to take it apart and I covered the whole back part in electric tape
2017-04-19 22:14:04	na_th_an	damn this keyboard is nice
2017-04-19 22:14:10	na_th_an	rip
2017-04-19 22:14:16	na_th_an	I'm jelly of haley's keyboard

2017-04-20 09:17:12	keveloper	yo
2017-04-20 09:17:13	keveloper	so

2017-04-20 09:19:35	keveloper	uh first thing
2017-04-20 09:19:45	keveloper	asteria.duckdns.org minecraft server is now protected af
2017-04-20 09:19:47	keveloper	whitelist
2017-04-20 09:19:51	na_th_an	word
2017-04-20 09:19:55	keveloper	whitelist on building
2017-04-20 09:20:05	keveloper	literally on i can place or break blocks right now

2017-04-20 09:20:22	na_th_an	word
2017-04-20 09:20:25	keveloper	second
2017-04-20 09:20:30	keveloper	i finished 13 reasons why last night
2017-04-20 09:20:37	na_th_an	ok
2017-04-20 09:20:40	keveloper	"the scene" yanno
2017-04-20 09:20:48	na_th_an	I don't 
2017-04-20 09:20:52	keveloper	of her killing herself
2017-04-20 09:20:55	na_th_an	ok
2017-04-20 09:21:05	keveloper	was the most disturbing terrible thing i have ever seen
2017-04-20 09:21:17	keveloper	i would never recommend that anyone ever watch that show
2017-04-20 09:21:33	keveloper	i didn't watch 90% of the scene and the sound alone almost made me throw up
2017-04-20 09:21:38	na_th_an	it's a kinda fucked up show
2017-04-20 09:21:41	na_th_an	it glorifies suicide
2017-04-20 09:21:48	keveloper	if you watch the whole thing it doesnt
2017-04-20 09:21:56	na_th_an	ehhhhhhhhhh
2017-04-20 09:21:58	keveloper	in parts yeah
2017-04-20 09:22:15	keveloper	all of the people on the show are pissed at her or hate her for doing it
2017-04-20 09:22:37	keveloper	a kid in the last episode shoots himself in the head because he blames himself
2017-04-20 09:22:51	keveloper	(and doesn't die)
2017-04-20 09:23:25	keveloper	hannah was supposed to be a failed suicide attempt but the writers didn't want to show a second chance kind of thing
2017-04-20 09:23:49	keveloper	its pretty fucked
2017-04-20 09:23:54	keveloper	2 very hard to watch rape scenes
2017-04-20 09:24:05	keveloper	emily is like very distraught from watching the last 2 episodes
2017-04-20 09:24:11	na_th_an	I mean I understand that it doesn't make it a fun topic or anything
2017-04-20 09:24:20	na_th_an	but it's literally a suicide revenge fantasy 
2017-04-20 09:24:22	keveloper	the fact that they are making art out of suicide yeah
2017-04-20 09:24:23	keveloper	yeah
2017-04-20 09:24:32	na_th_an	it doesn't really address the fact that it's a mental health problem
2017-04-20 09:24:36	keveloper	yes it does
2017-04-20 09:24:37	na_th_an	healthy people do not do that
2017-04-20 09:24:44	keveloper	they address that multiple times
2017-04-20 09:24:54	na_th_an	they must have done it better than in the book
2017-04-20 09:24:59	keveloper	who watched the show me or you :P
2017-04-20 09:25:14	keveloper	but yeah it was fucked
2017-04-20 09:25:20	keveloper	do you know how she killed her self
2017-04-20 09:25:23	na_th_an	idk, all of the peolpe I know irl who have struggled with suicdal thoughts think the show and book are disgusting
2017-04-20 09:25:25	na_th_an	and dangerous
2017-04-20 09:25:38	keveloper	oh im sure lindsey would like it
2017-04-20 09:25:41	na_th_an	it paints a suicide revenge fantasy that isn't healthy
2017-04-20 09:25:50	keveloper	ya it does
2017-04-20 09:26:08	keveloper	they showed a girl who cut her wrists and it looked v fake
2017-04-20 09:26:22	keveloper	but i have way to much experience with that :|
2017-04-20 09:26:43	na_th_an	:(
2017-04-20 09:27:14	keveloper	but yeah so she laid in the bathtub and cut her wrists
2017-04-20 09:27:16	keveloper	like vertically
2017-04-20 09:27:20	keveloper	down the artery
2017-04-20 09:27:28	keveloper	the scene was starting and i was like "dammit"
2017-04-20 09:27:30	keveloper	and i thought
2017-04-20 09:27:34	keveloper	oh this probably wont be that bad
2017-04-20 09:27:46	keveloper	and she was all calm
2017-04-20 09:27:51	keveloper	and i was like oh itll be fine
2017-04-20 09:28:18	keveloper	then cut her wrist and like wince in pain and screamed and started sobbing and gasping and i literally almost threw up
2017-04-20 09:28:21	keveloper	it is so fucked up
2017-04-20 09:28:23	keveloper	never watch it
2017-04-20 09:28:30	keveloper	also the second rape scene is awful
2017-04-20 09:28:32	na_th_an	i wasn't planning on it
2017-04-20 09:28:51	keveloper	emily was pretty off because of it
2017-04-20 09:29:00	keveloper	probably will be when she wakes up because im still thinking abou tit
2017-04-20 09:29:06	keveloper	then they show her parents finding her
2017-04-20 09:29:12	keveloper	and that was just as bad
2017-04-20 09:29:19	keveloper	but less distrubing and more depressing
2017-04-20 09:29:23	keveloper	and the mom was like in denial
2017-04-20 09:29:26	keveloper	like 'no youre fine'
2017-04-20 09:29:42	keveloper	i was like 'how the fuck did someone write this and were like ya ppl should watch this'
2017-04-20 10:01:56	keveloper	mark is so bad at explaining things
2017-04-20 10:02:08	keveloper	:'(
2017-04-20 10:02:11	keveloper	he's talking to zach
2017-04-20 10:02:18	keveloper	"thanks for all your help through the years"
2017-04-20 10:23:50	keveloper	yanno how it takes like 15 minutes for service config changes to show in dui
2017-04-20 10:24:04	keveloper	i thought that was a service config limitation
2017-04-20 10:24:28	keveloper	but its DS caching the wclconfig for 10 minutes
2017-04-20 10:37:12	keveloper	ive bneen working slow
2017-04-20 10:38:57	na_th_an	same
2017-04-20 10:39:04	keveloper	i just cant
2017-04-20 10:39:05	keveloper	yanno
2017-04-20 10:39:32	na_th_an	it's a hard week
2017-04-20 10:39:36	keveloper	ya idk why
2017-04-20 10:39:44	keveloper	sometimes i wish i didnt have to write unit tests
2017-04-20 10:40:11	na_th_an	our unit tests are kinda terrible
2017-04-20 10:40:20	na_th_an	100% code coverage is bad
2017-04-20 10:40:26	na_th_an	it's not just not helpful
2017-04-20 10:40:27	na_th_an	it's bad
2017-04-20 10:40:41	na_th_an	because instead of saying "what's a smart unit test" we say "how do we make it build"
2017-04-20 10:40:47	na_th_an	and we just write tautological tests
2017-04-20 10:41:45	keveloper	my ds project is fucked
2017-04-20 10:41:45	keveloper	uh
2017-04-20 10:41:56	keveloper	how do i delete and reimport

2017-04-20 10:44:04	na_th_an	i meant delete project
2017-04-20 10:44:09	na_th_an	like file -> close project
2017-04-20 10:44:11	na_th_an	then delete it
2017-04-20 10:44:12	keveloper	ahh there we go

2017-04-20 11:06:50	keveloper	he was so funny
2017-04-20 11:07:31	na_th_an	he's a rockstar
2017-04-20 11:34:22	na_th_an	when I was an intern patrick was like "don't change formatting of code you aren't editing unless you're taking ownership of it"
2017-04-20 11:34:28	na_th_an	and it made a lot of sense to me
2017-04-20 11:34:34	na_th_an	apparently nobody ever said that to dave
2017-04-20 11:35:13	keveloper	holy omg
2017-04-20 11:35:15	keveloper	its so annoying
2017-04-20 13:20:41	na_th_an	i wonder what mark's house is like on the inside
2017-04-20 13:20:50	keveloper	('-')

2017-04-21 09:03:06	na_th_an	lol
2017-04-21 09:03:26	keveloper	no maybe a lil too much idk
2017-04-21 09:03:29	keveloper	it was all sugary shit so
2017-04-21 09:03:31	keveloper	that type of hangover
2017-04-21 09:03:35	keveloper	my head doesnt hurt tho so thats goo
2017-04-21 09:03:37	keveloper	d
2017-04-21 09:38:25	na_th_an	tbh I think we made some kinda bad design decisions on discovery cite
2017-04-21 09:38:28	na_th_an	it's not terrible
2017-04-21 09:38:36	keveloper	like what
2017-04-21 09:38:37	na_th_an	but they wanted it to not have any connection to ds
2017-04-21 09:38:44	na_th_an	so dui sends a ton of fields to discoverycite
2017-04-21 09:38:53	na_th_an	which then does some transformation and sends it to easybib
2017-04-21 09:39:01	na_th_an	but that just means that we have extra logic
2017-04-21 09:39:06	na_th_an	because we have all this transformation on dui
2017-04-21 09:39:06	keveloper	ya
2017-04-21 09:39:10	na_th_an	to make the fields
2017-04-21 09:39:14	keveloper	true
2017-04-21 09:39:20	na_th_an	and put the right data in the right fields for the right format types
2017-04-21 09:39:28	na_th_an	then we basically have to do it again on the cite side
2017-04-21 09:40:15	na_th_an	so like right now I have to make dui not send the year to discovery cite so that discovery cite won't have a field to put in this one object so it won't get sent to easybib
2017-04-21 09:40:25	na_th_an	which is pretty terrible
2017-04-21 09:40:56	keveloper	:/
2017-04-21 09:40:57	keveloper	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-04-21 09:41:03	keveloper	software is hard

2017-04-21 09:41:24	na_th_an	it's not terrible
2017-04-21 09:41:29	na_th_an	even though I just said it was
2017-04-21 09:41:33	na_th_an	it could be a lot worse
2017-04-21 09:41:42	na_th_an	I just never liked that we went with that design
2017-04-21 09:41:43	keveloper	lol
2017-04-21 09:41:49	na_th_an	it's what angela and them all wanted tho
2017-04-21 09:41:50	keveloper	i could be way worse
2017-04-21 09:41:56	na_th_an	yeah
2017-04-21 09:41:58	na_th_an	it's not terrible

2017-04-21 12:39:28	keveloper	there hasn't been a hi train since beyblades started
2017-04-21 12:39:53	na_th_an	i think there has
2017-04-21 12:39:56	keveloper	rly
2017-04-21 12:40:11	na_th_an	thin kso
2017-04-21 12:40:46	keveloper	uhhh tmux switch session is what
2017-04-21 12:41:01	na_th_an	idk I can never remember that shit
2017-04-21 12:41:21	keveloper	i always detach and then run tmux attach
2017-04-21 12:41:24	keveloper	but i need to stop that shit
2017-04-21 12:41:26	keveloper	takes forever
2017-04-21 12:41:33	keveloper	C-a s
2017-04-21 12:41:44	keveloper	omg that's fucking dope
2017-04-21 12:41:47	keveloper	do that ^^
2017-04-21 12:41:50	na_th_an	do you usually run multiple sessions
2017-04-21 12:41:56	keveloper	yeah
2017-04-21 12:41:58	na_th_an	oh
2017-04-21 12:42:00	na_th_an	I don't
2017-04-21 12:42:04	keveloper	minecraft/pernt/weechat
2017-04-21 12:42:14	na_th_an	:/
2017-04-21 12:42:14	keveloper	do you run multiple screens in one session?
2017-04-21 12:42:18	keveloper	why :/
2017-04-21 12:42:32	na_th_an	running services in tmux isn't the best practice
2017-04-21 12:42:35	na_th_an	but it's not that big of a deal
2017-04-21 12:42:38	keveloper	oh
2017-04-21 12:42:38	keveloper	why not
2017-04-21 12:42:40	keveloper	i love it
2017-04-21 12:42:52	na_th_an	because your system has a service manager
2017-04-21 12:42:57	na_th_an	that can do things like manage logs for you
2017-04-21 12:43:05	na_th_an	automatically start your services when the server boots
2017-04-21 12:43:06	keveloper	i need to be able to get to the minecraft server to run commands
2017-04-21 12:43:16	na_th_an	things like that
2017-04-21 12:43:18	keveloper	minecraft servers are CLIs
2017-04-21 12:43:25	keveloper	its a prompt
2017-04-21 12:43:35	keveloper	so what else would i do besides tmux for that
2017-04-21 12:43:41	keveloper	for pernt ya u right but im lazy
2017-04-21 12:43:45	na_th_an	"Using systemd you may start and enable the included minecraftd.service"
2017-04-21 12:43:57	keveloper	idk if i have that
2017-04-21 12:44:05	keveloper	i use spigot
2017-04-21 12:44:06	na_th_an	To easily control the server you may use the provided minecraftd script. It is capable of doing the basic commands like start, stop, restart or attaching to the session with console. Moreover it may be used to display status information with status, backup the server world directory with backup, restore world data from backups with restore or run single commands in the server console with command <server
2017-04-21 12:44:08	keveloper	not vanilla minecraft
2017-04-21 12:44:08	na_th_an	command>.
2017-04-21 12:44:14	na_th_an	did you install minecraft-server from the aur
2017-04-21 12:44:20	keveloper	no
2017-04-21 12:44:24	na_th_an	oh then you won't
2017-04-21 12:44:26	na_th_an	rip
2017-04-21 12:44:32	keveloper	i use spigot
2017-04-21 12:44:37	keveloper	vanilla minecraft server is trash
2017-04-21 12:45:13	keveloper	so to start pernt in the background somewhere everytime my vps starts how should i do that
2017-04-21 12:45:26	keveloper	and i want to be able to easily kill it with annoying ps shit
2017-04-21 12:45:36	keveloper	although ps -aux | grep pernt
2017-04-21 12:45:37	keveloper	should work
2017-04-21 12:45:38	keveloper	but
2017-04-21 12:45:44	keveloper	i dont wanna run a kill command to shut it down
2017-04-21 12:45:50	na_th_an	how does pernt run
2017-04-21 12:45:54	keveloper	spring boot
2017-04-21 12:45:54	na_th_an	and no that's bad you're right
2017-04-21 12:45:58	na_th_an	also learn about 'pgrep'
2017-04-21 12:46:03	keveloper	mvn spring-boot:run
2017-04-21 12:46:10	keveloper	well the actual command is
2017-04-21 12:46:22	keveloper	sudo mvn spring-boot:run -Dserver.port=80
2017-04-21 12:46:33	na_th_an	:O it runs as root?
2017-04-21 12:46:40	keveloper	yeah -_-
2017-04-21 12:46:50	keveloper	that's the only way i could bind to 80
2017-04-21 12:46:58	keveloper	and iw as too lazy to setup port shit
2017-04-21 12:47:06	na_th_an	well if you want to do it right you should write a systemd unit file
2017-04-21 12:47:17	keveloper	and also
2017-04-21 12:47:18	keveloper	fuckin
2017-04-21 12:47:18	na_th_an	and then you could just do "systemctl start/stop/status pernt"
2017-04-21 12:47:20	keveloper	whats it called
2017-04-21 12:47:35	keveloper	forward incoming 80 to 8080
2017-04-21 12:47:37	keveloper	is callllled
2017-04-21 12:47:40	keveloper	not port forwarding
2017-04-21 12:47:43	keveloper	uhhh
2017-04-21 12:47:50	keveloper	or is that port forwarding
2017-04-21 12:47:53	keveloper	no its not
2017-04-21 12:47:53	na_th_an	redirecting?
2017-04-21 12:47:56	keveloper	yeah but
2017-04-21 12:48:00	keveloper	theres a name for it
2017-04-21 12:48:07	na_th_an	it's not generally what people talk about when they say "port forwarding" but that might be right
2017-04-21 12:48:29	keveloper	iptables is the worst fucking tool
2017-04-21 12:48:45	na_th_an	port redirect?
2017-04-21 12:48:50	keveloper	i guess port redirect yeah
2017-04-21 12:48:52	na_th_an	but ya iptables is kinda terrible
2017-04-21 12:49:00	keveloper	is there a better iptables
2017-04-21 12:49:05	na_th_an	idk
2017-04-21 12:50:29	na_th_an	just follow something like https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Running+Jenkins+on+Port+80+or+443+using+iptables
2017-04-21 12:50:58	keveloper	i mean i know how to use it
2017-04-21 12:51:03	keveloper	i've done port redirects before
2017-04-21 12:51:08	keveloper	i was just too lazy to do it for pernt
2017-04-21 12:51:13	keveloper	why is running as root so bad
2017-04-21 12:51:18	keveloper	its a jvm
2017-04-21 12:51:28	keveloper	the app doesn't touch the file system
2017-04-21 12:51:32	na_th_an	because that's how security works
2017-04-21 12:51:38	keveloper	blergh
2017-04-21 12:51:42	keveloper	but so laze
2017-04-21 12:51:45	na_th_an	if someone finds a vulnerability in spring, the jvm, any layer of your app
2017-04-21 12:51:54	keveloper	well its not running right now so
2017-04-21 12:51:56	na_th_an	if there's any vulnerability for remote code execution
2017-04-21 12:51:58	na_th_an	they have your whole system
2017-04-21 12:52:08	keveloper	blergh
2017-04-21 12:52:08	na_th_an	if it's a limited privilege user running the app
2017-04-21 12:52:12	na_th_an	then there's little they can do
2017-04-21 12:52:15	keveloper	i know jeeeeeeez
2017-04-21 12:52:24	na_th_an	then don't ask why
2017-04-21 12:52:26	na_th_an	:pp
2017-04-21 12:52:28	keveloper	have you ever felt lazy before
2017-04-21 12:52:36	na_th_an	every day
2017-04-21 12:52:47	na_th_an	I'm a lazy piece of shit
2017-04-21 12:52:49	na_th_an	it's in my blood
2017-04-21 12:52:50	keveloper	have you been hungover before
2017-04-21 12:52:56	na_th_an	yes
2017-04-21 12:53:00	na_th_an	at least 1 day a week
2017-04-21 12:53:03	keveloper	k now combine those
2017-04-21 12:53:17	keveloper	then try to use iptables
2017-04-21 12:53:20	na_th_an	again
2017-04-21 12:53:23	na_th_an	at least 1 day a week
2017-04-21 12:53:25	na_th_an	minus the iptables part
2017-04-21 12:53:29	keveloper	lmao
2017-04-21 12:53:31	na_th_an	i can't  do iptables on a good day
2017-04-21 12:53:50	na_th_an	mbp screen is so dim
2017-04-21 12:53:57	keveloper	turn it up
2017-04-21 12:54:00	na_th_an	it's on max brightness rn and I want it brrighter
2017-04-21 12:54:02	keveloper	i have never ran iptables on this vps
2017-04-21 12:54:05	keveloper	its a fresh bb
2017-04-21 13:18:10	na_th_an	I've noticed that standing up while working helps me poop
2017-04-21 13:18:12	na_th_an	alos
2017-04-21 13:18:18	na_th_an	I could tell mark was nearby through my headphones
2017-04-21 13:18:23	keveloper	nice

2017-04-21 13:18:30	keveloper	he behind me
2017-04-21 13:18:32	na_th_an	re: poop
2017-04-21 13:18:34	na_th_an	or re: mark
2017-04-21 13:18:36	na_th_an	which is same
2017-04-21 13:18:40	keveloper	all

2017-04-21 13:18:44	na_th_an	lul
2017-04-21 13:19:01	keveloper	alles ist gut
2017-04-21 13:19:19	na_th_an	i just really wanna learn haskell
2017-04-21 13:19:23	na_th_an	there's a haskell on the jvm thing
2017-04-21 13:21:33	keveloper	weird
2017-04-21 13:21:37	keveloper	why you so haskell
2017-04-21 13:22:11	na_th_an	because stack overflow analysis has shown for 2 years in a row that haskell is heavily used by people in the evenings 
2017-04-21 13:22:22	na_th_an	i.e. when programming with whatever stack they choose
2017-04-21 13:22:27	na_th_an	I've heard amazng things about its type system
2017-04-21 13:22:30	keveloper	hmmm
2017-04-21 13:22:34	na_th_an	it's a functional language but not a lisp
2017-04-21 13:22:39	na_th_an	so I'll learn how to think in a new way
2017-04-21 13:22:41	keveloper	are there classes
2017-04-21 13:22:43	na_th_an	but without ((((((()))))))
2017-04-21 13:22:48	na_th_an	no it's functional
2017-04-21 13:22:50	na_th_an	not object oriented
2017-04-21 13:23:01	keveloper	well some functional langauge have classes now so idk man
2017-04-21 13:23:07	na_th_an	i guess it could
2017-04-21 13:23:08	na_th_an	idk
2017-04-21 13:23:11	na_th_an	i don't think so tho
2017-04-21 13:23:19	keveloper	perl was pure functional before classes got thrown in
2017-04-21 13:45:04	na_th_an	unit tests in dui are so dumb
2017-04-21 13:45:08	na_th_an	ugh
2017-04-21 13:45:15	keveloper	ugh
2017-04-21 13:45:47	keveloper	product forgot about advanced search when making the scope thing
2017-04-21 13:46:05	na_th_an	i wonder what product people do at other companies

2017-04-21 14:44:06	keveloper	because i lagged for .5 secs
2017-04-21 14:44:15	keveloper	becuase the server sent her all the chunks
2017-04-21 14:44:24	na_th_an	lol

2017-04-24 09:10:05	na_th_an	ffs
2017-04-24 09:43:53	keveloper	yoooo
2017-04-24 09:43:55	keveloper	i made it

2017-04-24 10:45:25	na_th_an	do you wanna read my interview questions
2017-04-24 10:50:31	keveloper	yeah
2017-04-24 10:52:08	na_th_an	pbcopy stopped working for me
2017-04-24 10:53:17	na_th_an	oh it was a regression in the OS :( fucking apple 
2017-04-24 10:53:19	na_th_an	I really hate osx
2017-04-24 10:53:35	na_th_an	https://0bin.net/paste/uLINF6SBoa77uodV#hQyi962oi3OVgEOyR0kYeC6HQtYLd0wboMSmxDUVIJV
2017-04-24 10:53:58	keveloper	weird
2017-04-24 10:54:22	na_th_an	you have to do "reattach-to-user-namespace pbcopy"
2017-04-24 10:54:32	keveloper	first question is a little unfair maybe if they are entry
2017-04-24 10:54:39	keveloper	do you expect them to say "kibana"
2017-04-24 10:54:42	na_th_an	no
2017-04-24 10:54:50	na_th_an	I expect them to say that they'll trim the log down
2017-04-24 10:54:52	na_th_an	grep for errors
2017-04-24 10:55:05	na_th_an	find exceptions
2017-04-24 10:55:10	na_th_an	that's a thing that we're asked to do all the time
2017-04-24 10:55:11	keveloper	i dont think i knew json encoded logs existed before i was on this team
2017-04-24 10:55:18	na_th_an	the point is that the log is gross
2017-04-24 10:55:22	na_th_an	it's hard to look at
2017-04-24 10:55:24	na_th_an	what tools do you use
2017-04-24 10:55:28	na_th_an	I just want them to be like
2017-04-24 10:55:35	na_th_an	"I'll put it in a json viewer after grepping for a time frame"
2017-04-24 10:55:38	na_th_an	instead of
2017-04-24 10:55:44	na_th_an	"I"ll trudge through a giant log I can't reall yread"
2017-04-24 10:55:55	na_th_an	that's why I asked what tools they'd use 
2017-04-24 10:55:58	keveloper	'why is an immutable class useful' uhhhh - me
2017-04-24 10:56:00	keveloper	fast?
2017-04-24 10:56:07	na_th_an	paralellization :/-
2017-04-24 10:56:09	keveloper	ensures nobody edits it if its not supposed to be
2017-04-24 10:56:15	keveloper	wat
2017-04-24 10:56:31	na_th_an	if you have an immutable class it can be shared among multiple threads
2017-04-24 10:56:37	na_th_an	without having to worry about synchonization
2017-04-24 10:57:04	keveloper	- What is the difference between an array and a linked list?
2017-04-24 10:57:06	keveloper	lol
2017-04-24 10:57:12	na_th_an	too easy?
2017-04-24 10:57:15	keveloper	wtf is a sparse matrix
2017-04-24 10:57:19	na_th_an	this is supposed to be like, they can answer every single one
2017-04-24 10:57:26	na_th_an	exactly what it sounds like
2017-04-24 10:57:31	na_th_an	a matrix that is sparse
2017-04-24 10:57:37	na_th_an	like 100,000x100,000 with 1000 entries
2017-04-24 10:57:41	keveloper	and most are 0
2017-04-24 10:57:43	keveloper	or
2017-04-24 10:57:48	na_th_an	most are null/default
2017-04-24 10:58:05	keveloper	i always forget what polymorphism is
2017-04-24 10:58:12	keveloper	thats like extending and overriding right
2017-04-24 10:58:19	na_th_an	yeah I guess
2017-04-24 10:58:23	keveloper	overloading
2017-04-24 10:58:59	keveloper	also i can't remember sorting algorithm complexities
2017-04-24 10:59:06	keveloper	merge sort is n log n
2017-04-24 10:59:07	na_th_an	yeah but you aren't interviewing
2017-04-24 10:59:19	na_th_an	if you were going to a tech interview
2017-04-24 10:59:25	na_th_an	you should be able to explain at least ONE algorithm
2017-04-24 10:59:28	na_th_an	I don't expect them to know 5
2017-04-24 10:59:30	na_th_an	but just one
2017-04-24 10:59:30	keveloper	bogosort
2017-04-24 10:59:31	keveloper	lol
2017-04-24 11:00:09	na_th_an	I'd be most impressed if they said "insertion sort" and talked about how it was good for lists that are already almost sorted
2017-04-24 11:00:55	na_th_an	what do you think
2017-04-24 11:00:57	na_th_an	is ok?
2017-04-24 11:01:13	keveloper	mergesort is the one the recursively splits the list in half and sorts as it goes back up the stack right
2017-04-24 11:01:33	keveloper	ya is good still reading
2017-04-24 11:01:35	na_th_an	yeah
2017-04-24 11:02:32	keveloper	What is the heap and the stack?
2017-04-24 11:02:33	keveloper	lol
2017-04-24 11:02:42	keveloper	- What kind of data structure would you use to model indexes?
2017-04-24 11:02:44	keveloper	what do you mean
2017-04-24 11:02:50	na_th_an	indexes in the database 
2017-04-24 11:02:52	na_th_an	how do you model that
2017-04-24 11:03:05	na_th_an	how do you find an entry that is indexed quickly
2017-04-24 11:03:07	na_th_an	(binary search trees)
2017-04-24 11:03:12	keveloper	ohhh got it
2017-04-24 11:03:13	na_th_an	that should be easy?
2017-04-24 11:03:24	keveloper	- Describe what a normalized vs unnormalized database. Explain what normalization is.
2017-04-24 11:03:31	keveloper	whats the thing called
2017-04-24 11:04:22	keveloper	BCNF thats what its called
2017-04-24 11:04:23	keveloper	3NF
2017-04-24 11:04:24	keveloper	etc.
2017-04-24 11:04:27	keveloper	i forget about all of those
2017-04-24 11:05:11	keveloper	What kind of problems can be solved with pushdown automata but not deterministic finite automata? Can you give an example?
2017-04-24 11:05:18	keveloper	i have absolutely no idea what pushdown automata is
2017-04-24 11:05:35	keveloper	- What's the difference between UDP and TCP? Give an example for when you'd use each.
2017-04-24 11:05:57	keveloper	i bet you lunch tomorrow that he'll say UDP is good for sending game data for online multiplayer games
2017-04-24 11:06:53	na_th_an	yeah lol
2017-04-24 11:07:02	na_th_an	that's why that question is under "formal languages"
2017-04-24 11:07:06	na_th_an	you didn't take formal languages
2017-04-24 11:07:08	na_th_an	I wouldn't ask it
2017-04-24 11:07:13	na_th_an	if you did take it I would ask it
2017-04-24 11:07:21	keveloper	rip me
2017-04-24 11:07:23	keveloper	am i fired
2017-04-24 11:07:26	na_th_an	ya
2017-04-24 11:07:29	keveloper	when is interview
2017-04-24 11:07:31	na_th_an	I'm talking to rashmi about it
2017-04-24 11:07:32	na_th_an	idk
2017-04-24 11:07:37	na_th_an	not scheduled yet I think
2017-04-24 11:07:38	keveloper	k well
2017-04-24 11:07:42	na_th_an	she's doing phone interviews first
2017-04-24 11:07:50	keveloper	i'll bet you lunch after the interview that he'll say UDP for online gaming packets"
2017-04-24 11:08:00	keveloper	do you take bet
2017-04-24 11:08:09	keveloper	if he says literally anything else i have to buy you lunch
2017-04-24 11:08:26	na_th_an	no
2017-04-24 11:08:29	keveloper	why
2017-04-24 11:08:32	na_th_an	I do not take that bet
2017-04-24 11:08:34	na_th_an	he'll say that
2017-04-24 11:08:38	keveloper	he might not tho
2017-04-24 11:08:42	keveloper	what if he says
2017-04-24 11:09:21	keveloper	"for a connection that can hop wifi access points similar to mosh" lol
2017-04-24 11:09:29	na_th_an	lol
2017-04-24 11:09:32	na_th_an	hired
2017-04-24 11:09:43	keveloper	"the developer of course would have to implement their own reliable transfer over UDP in this case"
2017-04-24 11:09:56	keveloper	would you hire them
2017-04-24 11:10:02	keveloper	take the bet
2017-04-24 11:10:06	na_th_an	no
2017-04-24 11:10:08	keveloper	there's a lot of things you can use UDP for
2017-04-24 11:10:10	na_th_an	do you like questions
2017-04-24 11:10:10	keveloper	likeeee
2017-04-24 11:10:14	na_th_an	any commens
2017-04-24 11:10:15	na_th_an	ts
2017-04-24 11:10:17	keveloper	yeah except the formal lang one
2017-04-24 11:10:29	keveloper	i wasn't able to answer the NAT one without looking it up
2017-04-24 11:10:31	keveloper	i forgot what it was
2017-04-24 11:10:49	keveloper	but if you said "How have we gotten around the limitation of running out of IPv4 addresses"
2017-04-24 11:10:51	keveloper	might be better
2017-04-24 11:11:05	na_th_an	hmm
2017-04-24 11:11:09	na_th_an	ya that's a good idea
2017-04-24 11:11:10	keveloper	and also what benefits did our solution give us
2017-04-24 11:11:12	keveloper	i.e. security
2017-04-24 11:11:44	keveloper	also you could ask something about ipv6 but that might be too easy
2017-04-24 11:11:46	keveloper	like
2017-04-24 11:11:51	keveloper	idk
2017-04-24 11:12:15	keveloper	'what might eliminate the use of NATs'
2017-04-24 11:12:18	na_th_an	eh nobody cares about ipv6 yet
2017-04-24 11:12:21	keveloper	except i bet we will still use them
2017-04-24 11:12:23	keveloper	eh ok
2017-04-24 11:12:33	keveloper	i wodner if we will use NATs forever for security
2017-04-24 11:12:36	keveloper	even with IPv6
2017-04-24 11:12:59	keveloper	but yeah i think you should ask about how we got around the limited number of IPv4 addresses thing instead of the NAT thing
2017-04-24 11:13:13	keveloper	because its more important that they know the cause and solution than the name of the thing
2017-04-24 11:13:29	keveloper	err problem and solution
2017-04-24 11:13:55	keveloper	maybe ask about input sanitization for the DB stuff idk
2017-04-24 11:14:26	na_th_an	There are more devices attached to the Internet than there are IPv4 addresses. How does this happen?
2017-04-24 11:14:30	na_th_an	better?
2017-04-24 11:14:51	keveloper	hmmm
2017-04-24 11:14:58	keveloper	How does this work
2017-04-24 11:15:00	keveloper	not happen
2017-04-24 11:15:10	na_th_an	ok
2017-04-24 11:15:16	na_th_an	How does SQL injection happen? How is it prevented?
2017-04-24 11:15:20	na_th_an	yea?
2017-04-24 11:15:20	keveloper	yeah
2017-04-24 11:15:23	na_th_an	coo
2017-04-24 11:15:29	keveloper	idek the 'modern' way to prevent it
2017-04-24 11:15:36	na_th_an	JPA
2017-04-24 11:15:40	keveloper	are prepared statements still a thing
2017-04-24 11:15:41	na_th_an	or prepared statements
2017-04-24 11:15:43	na_th_an	yea
2017-04-24 11:15:50	na_th_an	it hasn't really changed unless you're using an ORM
2017-04-24 11:16:10	keveloper	JPA is bae
2017-04-24 11:16:21	keveloper	idk a real world example for a semaphore
2017-04-24 11:16:22	keveloper	uhh
2017-04-24 11:16:36	na_th_an	idk my expectations aren't high
2017-04-24 11:18:04	na_th_an	if they say anything that makes sense I'm happy
2017-04-24 11:22:28	keveloper	for our computer arch and dig log class
2017-04-24 11:22:44	keveloper	our prof let people build circuits in minecraft lol
2017-04-24 11:22:47	keveloper	so like when we made an adder
2017-04-24 11:22:53	keveloper	1 or 2 people built it in minecraft redstone
2017-04-24 11:22:57	keveloper	and got full credit lol
2017-04-24 11:23:34	keveloper	and some other dig log stuf fin it

2017-04-24 12:34:09	na_th_an	when I figured it out I was like "whoa"
2017-04-24 13:47:43	keveloper	can u review me http://git.ent.oclc.org/projects/DISC/repos/discoveryui/pull-requests/405/overview
2017-04-24 13:47:50	keveloper	and if say anything about stub() imma be like fuck u
2017-04-24 13:48:47	na_th_an	hey why did you use stub
2017-04-24 13:48:53	keveloper	>:O
2017-04-24 13:48:58	keveloper	look at class name
2017-04-24 13:49:08	na_th_an	a factory should be easy to test 
2017-04-24 13:49:10	na_th_an	??????

2017-04-24 13:54:43	na_th_an	to create a list of facets
2017-04-24 13:54:45	keveloper	yeah
2017-04-24 13:54:52	na_th_an	that's what collect does
2017-04-24 13:55:20	keveloper	oh right
2017-04-24 13:55:33	na_th_an	ez to forget
2017-04-24 13:56:22	keveloper	k done
2017-04-24 13:57:14	keveloper	i mock buildDefaultScopeFacets() in OWCCustomQueryFactoryTest
2017-04-24 13:57:15	keveloper	and its fine
2017-04-24 13:57:26	keveloper	and the private one doesn't need to be mock
2017-04-24 13:57:26	keveloper	ed
2017-04-24 13:58:41	keveloper	k you hap
2017-04-24 14:00:01	na_th_an	i suppose
2017-04-24 14:00:22	keveloper	well its only used by owccustomqueryfactory and thats groovy
2017-04-24 14:00:25	keveloper	what you think
2017-04-24 14:00:31	keveloper	methods should be static when they can be
2017-04-24 14:00:34	keveloper	and they can be
2017-04-24 14:01:30	na_th_an	idk, I've seen a lot of stuff in DUI that can be static but isn't
2017-04-24 14:01:40	keveloper	do you think i should change
2017-04-24 14:01:47	keveloper	we dont write java anymore
2017-04-24 14:01:48	na_th_an	idc
2017-04-24 14:01:50	keveloper	nothing that is java uses it
2017-04-24 14:01:51	keveloper	ugh
2017-04-24 14:01:52	na_th_an	just a suggestion
2017-04-24 14:01:57	na_th_an	if a tech lead says to change it then do it
2017-04-24 14:02:01	na_th_an	I just wanted to point it out
2017-04-24 14:02:08	keveloper	i dont like when things in intelliJ have warnings lol
2017-04-24 14:02:23	na_th_an	me either
2017-04-24 14:02:28	na_th_an	we should use something like checkstyle
2017-04-24 14:02:34	na_th_an	that can integrate with our build
2017-04-24 14:02:36	na_th_an	and our IDEs
2017-04-24 14:02:54	keveloper	yeah
2017-04-24 14:03:30	keveloper	i wonder how many people on the team have no PRs to review
2017-04-24 14:03:35	na_th_an	0
2017-04-24 14:03:42	keveloper	well at least 1 (me)
2017-04-24 14:03:45	na_th_an	I've had 5+ for like 2 weeks now
2017-04-24 14:03:50	keveloper	oh i did all of them today
2017-04-24 14:03:58	na_th_an	because I don't approve things unless I actually approve them
2017-04-24 14:04:06	na_th_an	I don't have time to go figure out wtf salpicon is working on rn
2017-04-24 14:04:11	na_th_an	so I've just been leaving those
2017-04-24 14:04:14	keveloper	idk if i should ping leads or just let them sit there

2017-04-24 14:04:54	na_th_an	I even said in our feature team retro that our pull requests are taking too long to get merged
2017-04-24 14:04:56	na_th_an	ffs
2017-04-24 14:05:02	na_th_an	i told him to do it in standup

2017-04-24 15:06:51	na_th_an	idfk, it's a good question tho
2017-04-24 15:06:57	na_th_an	that's a question that deserves an IDP
2017-04-24 15:07:09	na_th_an	investigate how the facet code got so terrible so we can never have that happen again
2017-04-24 15:07:13	na_th_an	I bet mark wrote a lot of it
2017-04-24 15:07:23	na_th_an	mark and xifeng

2017-04-24 15:12:50	keveloper	i cant use the scope-facet.tag because they arent facets and i dont have counts or anyhting
2017-04-24 15:13:01	keveloper	and building facets requires a phd
2017-04-24 15:13:15	keveloper	but anywhere there's always a count next to them
2017-04-24 15:13:34	keveloper	and facets have the branching shit
2017-04-24 15:13:41	keveloper	i dont want to write the logic twice
2017-04-24 15:13:44	keveloper	its in scope-facet already

2017-04-25 12:46:02	na_th_an	i wouldn't
2017-04-25 12:46:13	na_th_an	because that means they expect it to get done
2017-04-25 12:46:17	na_th_an	and I don't think I can do it
2017-04-25 12:46:24	na_th_an	I don't have ~$360k worth of skills
2017-04-25 12:46:25	keveloper	we would finish it eventually
2017-04-25 12:46:33	na_th_an	so I'm not going to put myself into that position
2017-04-25 12:46:43	keveloper	its just a java app
2017-04-25 12:46:47	keveloper	with some shitty perl scripts
2017-04-25 12:47:03	keveloper	that does some weird Z39.50 shit
2017-04-25 12:47:08	na_th_an	and isoft and dependencies nobody understands and jassi
2017-04-25 12:47:12	keveloper	but people stupider than you worked on it
2017-04-25 12:47:18	na_th_an	yeah
2017-04-25 12:47:34	na_th_an	frankly I do not think I'm capable of converting jassi to a tomcat or whatever
2017-04-25 12:47:45	na_th_an	sure I'd probably figure it out eventually
2017-04-25 12:47:46	keveloper	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-04-25 12:47:52	na_th_an	but i don't wanna

2017-04-25 14:17:03	na_th_an	what would you guess
2017-04-25 14:17:11	na_th_an	there is a god or no
2017-04-25 14:17:11	keveloper	uh
2017-04-25 14:17:39	keveloper	i think that if there is a 'god' its something we cant really comprehend and is _incredibly_ far from the christian god or any god thought up by humans
2017-04-25 14:17:52	keveloper	idk what i'd guess
2017-04-25 14:18:15	keveloper	like what made the rules of the universe
2017-04-25 14:18:18	keveloper	what set the speed of light
2017-04-25 14:18:20	keveloper	that kinda thing
2017-04-25 14:18:21	na_th_an	omnipotent benevolent got
2017-04-25 14:18:22	na_th_an	god*
2017-04-25 14:18:30	keveloper	that helps people day to day/
2017-04-25 14:18:32	keveloper	?
2017-04-25 14:18:34	keveloper	that kind of thing?
2017-04-25 14:18:48	na_th_an	when people talk about "existence of god"
2017-04-25 14:18:57	na_th_an	usually they mean an omnipotent benevolent being
2017-04-25 14:18:58	keveloper	ok in that case then no definitely no god
2017-04-25 14:19:05	keveloper	nature doesn't give a fuck about us or even any life
2017-04-25 14:19:10	na_th_an	yeah
2017-04-25 14:19:12	na_th_an	i agree
2017-04-25 14:19:25	na_th_an	it gets more complicated when you're like "well what if god is more like _____"
2017-04-25 14:19:29	keveloper	yeah
2017-04-25 14:19:39	na_th_an	but I do not believe there is a creator that can guide my life and put me here for a reason
2017-04-25 14:19:42	na_th_an	and loves me
2017-04-25 14:19:44	keveloper	oh no
2017-04-25 14:19:50	keveloper	love is something humans made up
2017-04-25 14:19:58	na_th_an	dogs can love
2017-04-25 14:20:00	na_th_an	fuck you
2017-04-25 14:20:02	keveloper	what does that mean
2017-04-25 14:20:08	keveloper	dogs can love because we say they can lol
2017-04-25 14:20:33	na_th_an	love is what we call a certain emotion that's created in the brain
2017-04-25 14:20:39	keveloper	love is a word to describe what happens in your brain when you see something you are dependent upon lol
2017-04-25 14:20:47	keveloper	like in the most concrete way thats what it is
2017-04-25 14:20:51	na_th_an	yeah
2017-04-25 14:20:54	na_th_an	and dogs have that
2017-04-25 14:20:59	na_th_an	becasue dogs are wonderful
2017-04-25 14:21:00	keveloper	i didnt say they didnt
2017-04-25 14:21:07	keveloper	im saying love is a word humans made up to describe that
2017-04-25 14:21:16	keveloper	im a materialist hardcore lol
2017-04-25 14:21:22	na_th_an	every word is a word humans made up to describe something
2017-04-25 14:21:28	keveloper	literally everything we do and think is based on a chemical reaction in our brain/body
2017-04-25 14:21:37	na_th_an	so are you a determinist
2017-04-25 14:21:37	keveloper	k fine lol
2017-04-25 14:21:42	keveloper	i think so
2017-04-25 14:21:47	keveloper	idk tho
2017-04-25 14:21:48	na_th_an	do you believe in free will
2017-04-25 14:21:51	keveloper	quantum shit throws it off
2017-04-25 14:21:56	keveloper	idk
2017-04-25 14:22:12	keveloper	like i do think everything is a chain reaction
2017-04-25 14:22:17	keveloper	butterfly effect
2017-04-25 14:22:24	keveloper	so like if i lose my job in 5 years
2017-04-25 14:22:37	keveloper	that was determine by something before iw as born
2017-04-25 14:22:44	keveloper	but also idk
2017-04-25 14:22:51	keveloper	i dont really think randomness is real
2017-04-25 14:23:32	na_th_an	yeah this is a very deterministic world view
2017-04-25 14:23:42	keveloper	like i wouldn't be alive if the asteroid that hit earth hit at .01 less degrees of an angle
2017-04-25 14:23:44	na_th_an	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism
2017-04-25 14:23:54	keveloper	what are you
2017-04-25 14:24:03	keveloper	do you think randomness is real
2017-04-25 14:24:12	na_th_an	idk
2017-04-25 14:24:18	keveloper	do you agree with determinism
2017-04-25 14:24:32	na_th_an	i'm not totally sure
2017-04-25 14:24:34	keveloper	i want to find out that thats not how it works but it just seems very logical to me
2017-04-25 14:24:38	na_th_an	like, i kinda do
2017-04-25 14:24:44	keveloper	like everything that happens is a giant reaction
2017-04-25 14:24:47	na_th_an	but I find it hard to argue against free will
2017-04-25 14:25:00	keveloper	like you choosing to do something?
2017-04-25 14:25:15	na_th_an	free will and determinism are mutually exclusive
2017-04-25 14:25:20	na_th_an	they are logically incompatible
2017-04-25 14:25:25	keveloper	your brain wanted to choose that thing based on its current state which was based on its last state etc. etc. all the way back to when you were born
2017-04-25 14:25:48	keveloper	ya or no
2017-04-25 14:26:01	na_th_an	I can't give an argument for why that isn't true 
2017-04-25 14:26:07	na_th_an	but I'm pretty sure it's not
2017-04-25 14:26:18	keveloper	hmm
2017-04-25 14:26:20	keveloper	can you like
2017-04-25 14:26:22	keveloper	describe
2017-04-25 14:26:24	keveloper	it at all
2017-04-25 14:26:25	keveloper	lol
2017-04-25 14:26:37	keveloper	like i want that to not be true
2017-04-25 14:26:42	na_th_an	I'm just pretty damn sure I have my own free will
2017-04-25 14:26:50	keveloper	but when i think about how i make my actions it seems like thats what it is
2017-04-25 14:27:00	keveloper	ok like
2017-04-25 14:27:04	keveloper	idk
2017-04-25 14:27:24	keveloper	you have free will to pick up your water bottle or not right now
2017-04-25 14:27:48	keveloper	but that decision was already pre determined by what was happening in your brain when i said that
2017-04-25 14:29:04	na_th_an	I think if you go deep enough the universe has randomness
2017-04-25 14:29:11	keveloper	like quantum level
2017-04-25 14:29:14	na_th_an	yeah
2017-04-25 14:29:18	keveloper	i dont think humans can really understand that yet lol
2017-04-25 14:29:34	na_th_an	me either
2017-04-25 14:29:36	na_th_an	but
2017-04-25 14:29:45	na_th_an	if you assume the universe is not random
2017-04-25 14:29:53	na_th_an	it's totally deterministic
2017-04-25 14:30:00	keveloper	so what
2017-04-25 14:30:06	na_th_an	hold on
2017-04-25 14:30:08	na_th_an	jeez
2017-04-25 14:30:13	keveloper	:O
2017-04-25 14:30:16	keveloper	garbble garbble
2017-04-25 14:30:21	na_th_an	then we had to be put in exactly the right beginning state to develop life and society and stuff to where we are now
2017-04-25 14:30:31	na_th_an	the odds of being randomly put into that state are very low
2017-04-25 14:30:36	na_th_an	life is complex
2017-04-25 14:30:59	na_th_an	some philospohers use this as an argument for an existence of a god
2017-04-25 14:31:21	na_th_an	or a many-universe theory
2017-04-25 14:31:29	keveloper	the universe is very big
2017-04-25 14:31:36	na_th_an	and we just happen to exist in the universe with life... because we are existing
2017-04-25 14:31:52	keveloper	also i dont think the universe has a beginning or end
2017-04-25 14:32:07	na_th_an	:O why
2017-04-25 14:32:13	keveloper	i think humans are stuck on beginning and end stuff because we all are born and die
2017-04-25 14:32:19	na_th_an	it's pretty accepted that there was a beginning to the universe
2017-04-25 14:32:21	na_th_an	we have evidence of it
2017-04-25 14:32:31	keveloper	it doesn't make sense
2017-04-25 14:32:34	keveloper	where did it come from
2017-04-25 14:32:41	na_th_an	that's a different question
2017-04-25 14:33:05	na_th_an	some people believe in a cyclical universe
2017-04-25 14:33:09	keveloper	what if eventually our 'universe' will collapse back into that single spot and another big bang will happen
2017-04-25 14:33:18	na_th_an	yeah that's the cyclical universe theory
2017-04-25 14:33:24	na_th_an	I don't think it's very widely accepted
2017-04-25 14:33:49	keveloper	we just obvserve such small amount of the universe i dont think its possible to know or even guess about its origin
2017-04-25 14:35:01	na_th_an	the universe is homogenous though
2017-04-25 14:35:07	na_th_an	it's a homogenous mixture
2017-04-25 14:35:19	na_th_an	we've been able to observe that
2017-04-25 14:35:40	keveloper	we don't know that there's another big bang from outside the obversable universe heading at us tho
2017-04-25 14:35:54	na_th_an	and there are some pieces of evidence that give strong indications of the early universe
2017-04-25 14:35:59	na_th_an	like cosmic background radiation
2017-04-25 14:36:09	na_th_an	have you ever seen the original cosmos series by carl sagan
2017-04-25 14:36:15	keveloper	parts of it
2017-04-25 14:36:20	na_th_an	you gotta watch it
2017-04-25 14:36:21	na_th_an	you'd like it
2017-04-25 14:36:23	na_th_an	it's great
2017-04-25 14:36:26	na_th_an	it talks about a lot of this stuff
2017-04-25 14:36:44	keveloper	do you think neil degrasse tyson is a fuck
2017-04-25 14:36:46	keveloper	beccause i do
2017-04-25 14:36:48	keveloper	he's a douche bag
2017-04-25 14:36:54	keveloper	and like way too arrogant
2017-04-25 14:36:59	keveloper	bill nye tho
2017-04-25 14:37:01	keveloper	bill nye is great
2017-04-25 14:37:07	na_th_an	yeah pretty much
2017-04-25 14:37:25	na_th_an	NGT wasn't a fuck at first but has totally become a fuck
2017-04-25 14:37:35	na_th_an	I don't totally hate him like some people do but I'm not a fan
2017-04-25 14:37:38	na_th_an	I never really was tho
2017-04-25 14:38:44	keveloper	gravity is also weird
2017-04-25 14:38:59	keveloper	i wonder if humans will ever be able to synthesize gravity
2017-04-25 14:40:06	na_th_an	gravy fucks with my brain
2017-04-25 14:40:17	keveloper	gravity?
2017-04-25 14:40:21	na_th_an	ya
2017-04-25 14:40:23	na_th_an	lol
2017-04-25 14:40:32	keveloper	the only explanation i have ever understood
2017-04-25 14:40:40	keveloper	is that mass distorts space right
2017-04-25 14:40:47	keveloper	so it takes up and stretches space
2017-04-25 14:41:13	keveloper	the space is elastic per se and trying to push back into its original position
2017-04-25 14:41:22	keveloper	in turn pushing mass
2017-04-25 14:41:43	na_th_an	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg
2017-04-25 14:41:44	keveloper	but whether or not that is correct or the most accepted explanation i do not know
2017-04-25 14:41:47	keveloper	i forget
2017-04-25 14:41:50	na_th_an	it's long but that's a good video on it
2017-04-25 14:41:58	keveloper	oh ive seen that
2017-04-25 14:42:02	na_th_an	that IS what gravit yis
2017-04-25 14:42:08	na_th_an	gravity is time and space being distorted by mass
2017-04-25 14:42:16	na_th_an	how that makes gravity do what it does I have no idea
2017-04-25 14:42:19	na_th_an	I don't understand it
2017-04-25 14:42:48	na_th_an	abby has no chill
2017-04-25 14:43:12	keveloper	how is my explanation different than that
2017-04-25 14:43:18	na_th_an	it wasn't
2017-04-25 14:43:18	keveloper	that was just a 2d representation of it
2017-04-25 14:43:21	na_th_an	I wasn't disagreeingwith you
2017-04-25 14:43:26	keveloper	oh ok
2017-04-25 14:43:27	keveloper	yeah
2017-04-25 14:44:12	keveloper	i think the easiest way to think about it on a 3d scale is the space being stretched and it pushes back to where it was and pushes mass with it
2017-04-25 14:44:13	keveloper	but idk
2017-04-25 14:44:16	keveloper	it makes me happy
2017-04-25 14:44:34	na_th_an	idk i don't understand gravity at all
2017-04-25 14:45:04	keveloper	i dont understand the speed of light speed limit
2017-04-25 14:45:26	na_th_an	computational limit on the simulation we live in
2017-04-25 14:45:33	keveloper	what
2017-04-25 14:45:56	na_th_an	it limits the draw distance so the computer can handle all of us
2017-04-25 14:46:04	keveloper	ok but really do you understand it
2017-04-25 14:46:20	na_th_an	how do you know I don't subscribe to simulation theory
2017-04-25 14:46:37	keveloper	because your answers above would be different
2017-04-25 14:46:50	na_th_an	which answers
2017-04-25 14:47:00	keveloper	about determinsm and gravity
2017-04-25 14:47:05	keveloper	and there being a god
2017-04-25 14:47:28	na_th_an	that's how the simulation implements gravity
2017-04-25 14:47:36	na_th_an	and my answers for detierminism still work
2017-04-25 14:47:43	na_th_an	is there randomness in th esimulation?
2017-04-25 14:47:43	keveloper	k
2017-04-25 14:47:47	na_th_an	we colud have free will in the simulation
2017-04-25 14:47:55	keveloper	k but rl
2017-04-25 14:47:55	na_th_an	or it could be a deterministic simulation
2017-04-25 14:48:00	na_th_an	that would be pretty pointless though
2017-04-25 14:48:19	na_th_an	why would you create a deterministic simulation for conciousness to explore
2017-04-25 14:48:30	na_th_an	i guess we have the illusion of free will at least
2017-04-25 14:48:39	na_th_an	maybe the simulation was designed with that in mind
2017-04-25 14:48:45	na_th_an	we don't need real free will, just the illusion
2017-04-25 14:48:46	na_th_an	idk
2017-04-25 14:49:12	keveloper	...
2017-04-25 14:49:14	keveloper	is this realy
2017-04-25 14:49:15	keveloper	real
2017-04-25 14:49:25	keveloper	do you think we live in a simulation
2017-04-25 14:49:28	keveloper	like elon musk
2017-04-25 14:49:32	na_th_an	it's a possibility for sure
2017-04-25 14:49:53	na_th_an	probably not
2017-04-25 14:49:57	na_th_an	gun-to-head I'd say no
2017-04-25 14:50:00	keveloper	have you heard elon musks reasoning
2017-04-25 14:50:02	na_th_an	yes
2017-04-25 14:50:03	keveloper	its so dumb
2017-04-25 14:50:14	na_th_an	that's not a new idea he came up with
2017-04-25 14:50:26	keveloper	that explanation is dumb
2017-04-25 14:50:28	na_th_an	that's an idea that's been debated by philosophers for a long time
2017-04-25 14:50:33	na_th_an	as has that explanation
2017-04-25 14:50:49	na_th_an	you're discounting the work of a lot of smart people by saying "its so dumb"
2017-04-25 14:52:52	keveloper	welp
2017-04-25 14:53:16	keveloper	i just wanna find out if there is other life
2017-04-25 14:53:46	na_th_an	https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/678y49/cmv_we_are_not_living_in_a_simulation/
2017-04-25 14:53:54	na_th_an	that topic has some good discussion on this subject
2017-04-25 15:01:39	keveloper	i get very muddy when i think about this like
2017-04-25 15:01:43	keveloper	like i have no purpose
2017-04-25 15:01:48	keveloper	lol
2017-04-25 15:03:11	na_th_an	we don't
2017-04-25 15:03:21	na_th_an	life is inheritly meaningless
2017-04-25 15:03:47	na_th_an	what that means tho, is you are free to define your own meaning in life
2017-04-25 15:03:55	na_th_an	that's nihilism
2017-04-25 15:34:40	keveloper	can we stop putting html in properties lol
2017-04-25 15:35:00	na_th_an	no
2017-04-25 15:37:50	keveloper	wait
2017-04-25 15:37:50	keveloper	what
2017-04-25 15:37:52	keveloper	<c:if test="${not empty resultsPage.enhancedBibSearchResults.enhancedBibRecords}">
2017-04-25 15:37:52	keveloper	        <core:alert-warn id="no-records-found">
2017-04-25 15:38:10	na_th_an	hmm
2017-04-25 15:38:11	na_th_an	neat
2017-04-25 15:38:13	keveloper	lol

2017-04-26 08:55:48	keveloper	have you ever wondered what stephen does when he goes home for lunch because he used to do that all the time
2017-04-26 08:56:07	keveloper	like literally every day he'd be like "i have an errand"
2017-04-26 08:56:12	na_th_an	did he go home?
2017-04-26 08:56:14	keveloper	idk
2017-04-26 08:56:18	na_th_an	I remember him saying errand
2017-04-26 08:56:22	keveloper	but it was like everyday
2017-04-26 08:56:23	na_th_an	but i don't think he went all the way home
2017-04-26 08:56:28	keveloper	who has a lunchtime errand to run everyday
2017-04-26 08:56:42	na_th_an	i assume he just wanted to get away and be alone for a bit
2017-04-26 08:56:43	na_th_an	id
2017-04-26 08:56:45	na_th_an	k
2017-04-26 08:56:50	na_th_an	get something from kroger
2017-04-26 08:56:51	na_th_an	get gas
2017-04-26 08:56:57	na_th_an	send mail
2017-04-26 08:57:01	na_th_an	go to bank
2017-04-26 08:57:02	na_th_an	etc
2017-04-26 08:57:13	na_th_an	if you plan to do shit on your lunch it's easier to come up with more errands
2017-04-26 08:57:16	keveloper	what if it was condoms so him and abby could have sex in the sleep room thing
2017-04-26 08:57:20	keveloper	:o
2017-04-26 08:57:32	na_th_an	i don't think that was it
2017-04-26 08:57:35	keveloper	lol
2017-04-26 08:59:08	na_th_an	dave 100% used the wrong words in his email
2017-04-26 08:59:10	na_th_an	the path changed 
2017-04-26 08:59:14	na_th_an	the path is part of the uri
2017-04-26 08:59:17	na_th_an	of course the uri changed
2017-04-26 08:59:23	na_th_an	it's a new location
2017-04-26 08:59:27	na_th_an	a whole new uri
2017-04-26 09:01:08	keveloper	where
2017-04-26 09:01:23	na_th_an	*eyeroll*
2017-04-26 09:01:26	na_th_an	oh he only copied me
2017-04-26 09:01:32	na_th_an	i fucking hate when people don't copy the whole team
2017-04-26 09:01:33	keveloper	what was it
2017-04-26 09:01:44	na_th_an	because then 3 different people send emails to middleware
2017-04-26 09:01:49	na_th_an	it's the coverart serv)e
2017-04-26 09:01:57	na_th_an	they changed their path
2017-04-26 09:02:06	na_th_an	from like /somethingdumb to /coverart
2017-04-26 09:02:15	na_th_an	but ds properties just has the base domain name 
2017-04-26 09:02:16	keveloper	what did he say
2017-04-26 09:02:17	na_th_an	without the path
2017-04-26 09:02:20	na_th_an	so we have to do a code change
2017-04-26 09:02:25	na_th_an	to check if it's prod 
2017-04-26 09:02:31	na_th_an	unless they support both
2017-04-26 09:02:33	na_th_an	whic they don't
2017-04-26 09:02:48	na_th_an	and he's like "your uri changed help"
2017-04-26 09:02:55	keveloper	lol
2017-04-26 09:03:04	na_th_an	he doesn't mention the path part of it
2017-04-26 09:03:04	keveloper	he just wants to sound smart by saying URI
2017-04-26 09:03:07	keveloper	except incorrectly
2017-04-26 09:03:09	na_th_an	they're gonna have no idea what he's talking about
2017-04-26 09:03:14	na_th_an	pretty much
2017-04-26 09:03:54	keveloper	isnt the whole thing a URI
2017-04-26 09:03:57	keveloper	like a URL is a URI
2017-04-26 09:04:15	na_th_an	without looking it up I think so
2017-04-26 09:04:25	na_th_an	a URI is a more general term for a URL I think
2017-04-26 09:04:41	na_th_an	yea
2017-04-26 09:04:44	na_th_an	URNs are URIs
2017-04-26 09:04:45	keveloper	URI has like URN and URLs in it
2017-04-26 09:04:47	keveloper	yeah
2017-04-26 09:04:51	keveloper	and file paths are URIs
2017-04-26 09:04:51	na_th_an	he's 100% jus ttrying to sound smart
2017-04-26 09:04:52	keveloper	but not URLs
2017-04-26 09:04:58	na_th_an	and being more wrong by saying URI instead of URL
2017-04-26 09:05:04	na_th_an	and saying URI instead of path
2017-04-26 09:05:09	keveloper	so what changed
2017-04-26 09:05:11	keveloper	the path?
2017-04-26 09:05:14	na_th_an	yeah
2017-04-26 09:05:15	keveloper	and the host?
2017-04-26 09:05:19	na_th_an	yeah
2017-04-26 09:05:21	na_th_an	dui has
2017-04-26 09:05:23	keveloper	ok
2017-04-26 09:05:33	na_th_an	coverart.baseUrl=//cartws.ent.oclc.org/ImageWebSvc
2017-04-26 09:05:38	na_th_an	but in the ds properties it's only like
2017-04-26 09:05:42	na_th_an	coverart.baseUrl=//cartws.ent.oclc.org/
2017-04-26 09:05:46	keveloper	ok
2017-04-26 09:05:50	na_th_an	but the new endpoint has /CoverArt 
2017-04-26 09:05:55	keveloper	ok
2017-04-26 09:05:55	na_th_an	instead of /ImageWebSvc
2017-04-26 09:05:57	keveloper	ok
2017-04-26 09:06:02	keveloper	yeah so the path changed
2017-04-26 09:06:06	na_th_an	yeah
2017-04-26 09:06:13	keveloper	i think he just doesnt know what a URI is
2017-04-26 09:06:17	na_th_an	obv not
2017-04-26 09:06:24	keveloper	a path might BE a URI tho
2017-04-26 09:06:24	na_th_an	and he thinks he does so he's not gonna look it up
2017-04-26 09:06:25	keveloper	...
2017-04-26 09:06:32	na_th_an	no a path is part of a uri
2017-04-26 09:06:41	keveloper	a part of a URI can be a URI
2017-04-26 09:06:44	na_th_an	 scheme:[//[user[:password]@]host[:port]][/path][?query][#fragment]
2017-04-26 09:06:51	keveloper	/home/bskcx/poop is a URI
2017-04-26 09:06:51	na_th_an	I looked this up when I talked about this
2017-04-26 09:06:56	keveloper	/home/bskcx is also a URI
2017-04-26 09:06:58	na_th_an	because I like to use the correct words for things
2017-04-26 09:07:15	na_th_an	it is not
2017-04-26 09:07:25	keveloper	wait what
2017-04-26 09:07:26	na_th_an	a uri is supposed to have a scheme
2017-04-26 09:07:34	keveloper	hmmmm
2017-04-26 09:07:38	keveloper	URNs are URIs tho
2017-04-26 09:07:42	keveloper	and a URN doesn't have a scheem
2017-04-26 09:07:51	na_th_an	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier
2017-04-26 09:07:57	na_th_an	go debate wikipedia *shrug*
2017-04-26 09:08:10	keveloper	oh URNs do have schemes ok
2017-04-26 09:08:18	keveloper	i read this https://danielmiessler.com/study/url-uri/
2017-04-26 09:08:24	keveloper	and the URNs there dont have schemes
2017-04-26 09:09:26	keveloper	a phone number is a URI but not a URL
2017-04-26 09:09:35	keveloper	the scheme is tel: tho
2017-04-26 09:09:46	keveloper	ok so right a path is not a URI
2017-04-26 09:09:50	na_th_an	i hope you're gonna tell dave about this
2017-04-26 09:09:52	na_th_an	inform him
2017-04-26 09:09:55	keveloper	no

2017-04-26 09:11:34	keveloper	i know i know dave should be a UUID refering to the people table
2017-04-26 09:11:55	keveloper	this table is called person_has_misconception

2017-04-26 09:20:05	na_th_an	ya
2017-04-26 10:03:43	keveloper	phd in fluid dynamics
2017-04-26 10:03:44	keveloper	hmm
2017-04-26 10:30:22	na_th_an	Well DEV/NIT/NAT have the URI “/CoverArt” and prod uses “/ImageWebSvc”.  That’s our sticking point because the URI is in our codebase whereas the hostname is in a properties file. 
2017-04-26 10:30:27	na_th_an	confirmed dave does not know what a URI is

2017-04-26 10:33:54	keveloper	if i got zealios and keycaps
2017-04-26 10:33:56	keveloper	i would get cherry stabs

2017-04-26 11:04:46	keveloper	hmm how many switches do i need
2017-04-26 11:05:01	na_th_an	I'd probably get like 80 to be safe if you're doing ~70% build
2017-04-26 11:05:16	na_th_an	I got 70 for my 60% which is 61 keys
2017-04-26 11:06:39	keveloper	it has 84 switches
2017-04-26 11:06:43	keveloper	84 keys
2017-04-26 11:06:47	na_th_an	oh right F row
2017-04-26 11:06:50	na_th_an	so buy like 90

2017-04-26 11:08:41	keveloper	hm how loud are they
2017-04-26 11:08:45	na_th_an	very clicky
2017-04-26 11:08:50	na_th_an	remember when we were on discord
2017-04-26 11:08:53	keveloper	what do you have zealio on
2017-04-26 11:08:53	na_th_an	and you were like "wow"
2017-04-26 11:08:57	na_th_an	nothing yet
2017-04-26 11:08:59	na_th_an	they're for my 60% 
2017-04-26 11:09:04	na_th_an	which i don't have all the parts for yet
2017-04-26 11:09:13	keveloper	hmmm
2017-04-26 11:09:19	keveloper	whats a cheaper tactile one
2017-04-26 11:09:30	keveloper	$82!! for swithces
2017-04-26 11:09:47	na_th_an	there aren't great options for tactile switches other than zealios
2017-04-26 11:09:55	na_th_an	you can get cherry browns or clears
2017-04-26 11:10:00	na_th_an	and I think gateron makes one but it's not great
2017-04-26 11:10:01	keveloper	$200 without caps and stabs and usb cable
2017-04-26 11:10:20	keveloper	should i just do like gateron browns idk
2017-04-26 11:10:45	na_th_an	it's up to you man
2017-04-26 11:12:10	keveloper	also hall effect is too loud for work
2017-04-26 11:12:21	na_th_an	it's no worse than record builder team
2017-04-26 11:12:28	keveloper	lol
2017-04-26 11:12:31	na_th_an	but linears 
2017-04-26 11:12:31	keveloper	ahhhh cherry browns
2017-04-26 11:12:32	na_th_an	rip
2017-04-26 11:13:35	na_th_an	gateron browns are probably better than cherry browns
2017-04-26 11:13:37	keveloper	yeah the hall effect is not good
2017-04-26 11:13:46	na_th_an	they're good linear switches I think
2017-04-26 11:13:50	na_th_an	I just don't like linear switches
2017-04-26 11:13:53	na_th_an	they are super smooth
2017-04-26 11:13:57	keveloper	they are really rattley and loud

2017-04-26 13:04:16	keveloper	booo
2017-04-26 13:04:19	keveloper	webdev is more important
2017-04-26 13:06:37	na_th_an	i haven't seen mark fall asleep all week
2017-04-26 13:06:40	na_th_an	yay

2017-04-26 13:08:55	keveloper	oh its arij's cat jk
2017-04-26 13:08:59	keveloper	think that testing will be done in time
2017-04-26 13:09:06	na_th_an	lul
2017-04-26 13:09:29	na_th_an	yesterday she was like "I'm gonna have to stay late then work tonight to get all this tested"
2017-04-26 13:09:37	keveloper	idk maybe i just dont remember how long it takes to test things but
2017-04-26 13:09:43	keveloper	i was in qa once
2017-04-26 13:09:53	keveloper	i did manual testing
2017-04-26 13:10:06	keveloper	she's been looking at irc and that picture since i messaged you
2017-04-26 13:10:09	na_th_an	imagine if mark were the only developer on our team
2017-04-26 13:10:18	na_th_an	so your performance was stacked against mark
2017-04-26 13:10:24	keveloper	truew
2017-04-26 13:10:28	na_th_an	you only have to be faster than him to look good
2017-04-26 13:10:32	keveloper	idk tho i would still try my hardest
2017-04-26 13:10:40	na_th_an	yeah but you're still not gonna be very motivated
2017-04-26 13:10:43	keveloper	i like to get shit done
2017-04-26 13:10:50	keveloper	i'm motivated when im alone
2017-04-26 13:13:23	na_th_an	it's weird to me that places have frontend and backend devs
2017-04-26 13:13:31	na_th_an	we just have to know everything
2017-04-26 13:13:53	keveloper	yeah
2017-04-26 13:14:06	keveloper	well tbf we have templating so
2017-04-26 13:14:11	na_th_an	so?
2017-04-26 13:14:13	keveloper	if there was a DUI front end and back end
2017-04-26 13:14:16	keveloper	then maybe not
2017-04-26 13:14:27	keveloper	the backend people would tell us the contract
2017-04-26 13:14:35	keveloper	and we would modify the front end accordingly
2017-04-26 13:14:54	keveloper	if the front end and back end werent coupled
2017-04-26 13:15:02	keveloper	in a giant ball of shoe laces
2017-04-26 13:15:08	na_th_an	the more I see it
2017-04-26 13:15:09	na_th_an	and think about it
2017-04-26 13:15:11	na_th_an	and read about it 
2017-04-26 13:15:12	keveloper	that have been rolling down the street
2017-04-26 13:15:14	na_th_an	I think MVC is bad
2017-04-26 13:15:19	keveloper	what is better
2017-04-26 13:15:22	keveloper	what should i used
2017-04-26 13:15:33	na_th_an	by MVC I mean 'classic' mvc
2017-04-26 13:15:38	na_th_an	where you have a controller that returns a view
2017-04-26 13:15:41	na_th_an	that it builds off a model
2017-04-26 13:15:46	keveloper	oh
2017-04-26 13:15:46	keveloper	yes
2017-04-26 13:15:52	na_th_an	controller returns a model and view that's rendered in the browser
2017-04-26 13:16:01	na_th_an	it just doesn't work for modern web development
2017-04-26 13:16:13	na_th_an	especially single page applications
2017-04-26 13:16:14	keveloper	then you think _>
2017-04-26 13:16:15	keveloper	what
2017-04-26 13:16:24	na_th_an	huh
2017-04-26 13:16:49	keveloper	what is best
2017-04-26 13:16:59	keveloper	rest back end?
2017-04-26 13:17:01	na_th_an	idk what acronym you'd call it
2017-04-26 13:17:07	na_th_an	but yeah, rest backend
2017-04-26 13:17:13	keveloper	returns json to front end
2017-04-26 13:17:14	keveloper	or something
2017-04-26 13:17:22	keveloper	front end updates accordingly
2017-04-26 13:17:24	na_th_an	backend should realyl only have state for authentication and authorization
2017-04-26 13:17:25	keveloper	so single page app or?
2017-04-26 13:17:44	na_th_an	single page app is the only way to make modern web applications that look like what users expect
2017-04-26 13:17:52	keveloper	ok so if i go to website.com/path
2017-04-26 13:18:01	keveloper	it would get static markup from a simple http server
2017-04-26 13:18:03	keveloper	the path
2017-04-26 13:18:08	keveloper	all static content js css from there
2017-04-26 13:18:15	keveloper	anything dynamic on the page
2017-04-26 13:18:26	keveloper	there's xhr for that
2017-04-26 13:18:34	keveloper	that gets data from a rest endpoint
2017-04-26 13:18:35	na_th_an	i have no idea what you're saying
2017-04-26 13:18:37	keveloper	updates page
2017-04-26 13:18:39	keveloper	jfidoafjdsoiafjdsfiodsjaf
2017-04-26 13:18:46	keveloper	how
2017-04-26 13:18:56	na_th_an	what do you mean
2017-04-26 13:19:00	na_th_an	use words
2017-04-26 13:19:01	keveloper	so you have a simple http server to serve static conent
2017-04-26 13:19:01	na_th_an	not asthisacipdsantehidu
2017-04-26 13:19:12	na_th_an	ok
2017-04-26 13:19:12	keveloper	so if i go to /path
2017-04-26 13:19:17	keveloper	it serves me the html
2017-04-26 13:19:20	na_th_an	ok
2017-04-26 13:19:31	keveloper	that static server also handle css/js
2017-04-26 13:19:34	keveloper	correct?
2017-04-26 13:19:42	na_th_an	yeah?
2017-04-26 13:19:48	na_th_an	or a cdn
2017-04-26 13:19:53	na_th_an	i have no idea where you're going with this
2017-04-26 13:19:55	keveloper	k then i have another server for my backend logic and that is a rest api
2017-04-26 13:19:56	na_th_an	i have no idea what you're asking me
2017-04-26 13:20:08	na_th_an	i mean it can be the same server
2017-04-26 13:20:12	keveloper	and the frontend uses xhr to communicate with that
2017-04-26 13:20:55	na_th_an	there's more than one way you can do it
2017-04-26 13:21:04	keveloper	but thats the kind of thing you mean
2017-04-26 13:21:20	keveloper	is there no name for that pattern yet
2017-04-26 13:21:43	na_th_an	idk there probably is
2017-04-26 13:21:50	na_th_an	mvvvvvvvvvvmc
2017-04-26 13:21:52	na_th_an	or some dumb shit
2017-04-26 13:22:11	keveloper	sfrb
2017-04-26 13:22:14	na_th_an	really the pattern is called "single page webapplication"
2017-04-26 13:22:16	keveloper	static frontend rest backend lol
2017-04-26 13:22:17	keveloper	idk
2017-04-26 13:23:17	keveloper	decouple stack
2017-04-26 13:23:18	keveloper	d
2017-04-26 13:46:41	na_th_an	i realized yesterday 
2017-04-26 13:46:49	na_th_an	cheddar ruffles chips have 230 calories
2017-04-26 13:46:51	na_th_an	a red bull has 110
2017-04-26 13:46:55	na_th_an	110 calories isn't that many
2017-04-26 13:47:07	keveloper	except the redbull i drink
2017-04-26 13:47:15	keveloper	buts 1% of cancer
2017-04-26 14:01:25	keveloper	can you make quotes channel specific

2017-04-26 15:19:29	keveloper	true
2017-04-26 15:19:43	na_th_an	and ya if she gets a promotion......
2017-04-26 15:19:58	na_th_an	I'd be pretty mad if someone who consistently works less than 40 hours a week gets a promotion

2017-04-27 09:20:25	keveloper	"i'll be here every day i can"

2017-04-27 09:34:31	na_th_an	people should know what code they have in integration and what's in progress being tested

2017-04-27 09:35:06	na_th_an	it's directly visible in jira if people do their jobs properly and put the ticket name in the branches
2017-04-27 09:35:25	na_th_an	obviously we are unable to do seperate feature branches and merge them at the end

2017-05-01 13:25:24	na_th_an	Strong problem solving skills - think outside the box
2017-05-01 13:25:26	na_th_an	Self starter. don't just follow the herd
2017-05-01 13:25:28	na_th_an	The limited experience they have - demonstrate that they a good mastery of what they have been exposed to.
2017-05-01 13:25:30	na_th_an	And a cheerful personality
2017-05-01 13:25:33	na_th_an	"think outside the box"
2017-05-01 13:26:16	na_th_an	lol zach said
2017-05-01 13:26:20	na_th_an	"thanks for the tips
2017-05-01 13:26:42	keveloper	lllllloooooooooolllllllll
2017-05-01 13:27:03	na_th_an	no we were gonna find someone who's an asshole
2017-05-01 13:27:08	na_th_an	with bad problem solving skills
2017-05-01 13:27:14	na_th_an	that isn't self motivated
2017-05-01 13:27:16	keveloper	why does abby get mad about 'nigga'
2017-05-01 13:28:10	na_th_an	because she has to get offended for minorities 
2017-05-01 13:28:16	na_th_an	because if you don't you're racist
2017-05-01 13:28:22	na_th_an	and she doesn't wanna be racist
2017-05-01 13:28:32	keveloper	lol
2017-05-01 13:32:23	keveloper	is nigga even bad anymore
2017-05-01 13:32:34	keveloper	like faggot is 1000x worse right
2017-05-01 13:32:40	na_th_an	it depends on who you talk to and the context
2017-05-01 13:32:46	keveloper	i guess so
2017-05-01 13:32:51	keveloper	quoting nigga nigga nigga is not bad
2017-05-01 13:32:54	na_th_an	no
2017-05-01 13:32:57	na_th_an	imo quoting music is fine
2017-05-01 13:33:01	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-01 13:33:17	na_th_an	a bunch of white people on irc calling each other 'nigga' is sorta weird
2017-05-01 13:33:20	na_th_an	I wouldn't call it offensive
2017-05-01 13:33:22	na_th_an	but I wouldn't do it
2017-05-01 13:33:26	na_th_an	but again, context
2017-05-01 13:33:27	keveloper	lol yeah
2017-05-01 13:33:30	keveloper	veam said it as a joke tho
2017-05-01 13:33:31	na_th_an	that could be done in a racist mannerc
2017-05-01 13:33:34	na_th_an	not that I think it was done here
2017-05-01 13:33:43	keveloper	its just funny because abby is easily offended
2017-05-01 13:33:47	na_th_an	and I also think that assigning a blanket ban on the word and callign it "the word" is
2017-05-01 13:33:50	na_th_an	bad
2017-05-01 13:33:52	na_th_an	it's like voldemort
2017-05-01 13:33:55	na_th_an	not saying tha name gives him power
2017-05-01 13:34:06	na_th_an	and it's not like 'nigger' is going to fall out of common usage
2017-05-01 13:34:14	na_th_an	because black people use it amongst each other
2017-05-01 13:34:14	keveloper	lol
2017-05-01 13:34:17	na_th_an	nobody says that's racist
2017-05-01 13:34:22	na_th_an	it's part of their culcure
2017-05-01 13:34:25	na_th_an	culture
2017-05-01 13:34:38	na_th_an	and it's a culture that's shared by all of america
2017-05-01 13:34:42	na_th_an	because we're a melting pot
2017-05-01 13:34:58	na_th_an	I don't buy that I'm not allowed to sing a song written by someone else in my country
2017-05-01 13:35:05	na_th_an	because my skin is the wrong color
2017-05-01 13:35:14	na_th_an	except for the nigga nigga nigga song
2017-05-01 13:35:17	na_th_an	they can have that one
2017-05-01 13:35:18	na_th_an	idk it's complicated
2017-05-01 13:35:51	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-01 13:35:59	keveloper	im assuming
2017-05-01 13:36:03	keveloper	abby has some prejudice thoughts
2017-05-01 13:36:09	keveloper	so she overcompensates
2017-05-01 13:36:59	na_th_an	idk, her actions are pretty consisent with the female tumblr sjw-lite
2017-05-01 13:37:03	na_th_an	like she's not full sjw
2017-05-01 13:37:06	na_th_an	crazy internet person
2017-05-01 13:37:19	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-01 13:37:22	keveloper	she might be on the internet
2017-05-01 13:37:25	na_th_an	but she's closer to that end of the spectrum than /r/redpill
2017-05-01 13:37:35	keveloper	she got mad about the casting of a character in a marvel movie
2017-05-01 13:37:45	keveloper	a MARVEL movie
2017-05-01 13:37:58	keveloper	marvel is like the most diverse universe of fictional characters
2017-05-01 13:38:36	na_th_an	her complaint was more about hollywood than marvel
2017-05-01 13:38:43	na_th_an	I think that's a bad example to latch on to
2017-05-01 13:38:43	keveloper	no it was specifically that movie
2017-05-01 13:38:46	na_th_an	I know
2017-05-01 13:38:47	keveloper	she like wanted to boycot it
2017-05-01 13:38:48	na_th_an	I know
2017-05-01 13:38:50	na_th_an	I know
2017-05-01 13:38:52	na_th_an	we've talked about this like 5 times
2017-05-01 13:38:56	keveloper	its annoying
2017-05-01 13:39:03	na_th_an	you're both annoying
2017-05-01 13:39:09	na_th_an	you act like it's nothing at all
2017-05-01 13:39:13	na_th_an	abby acts like it's the biggest deal ever
2017-05-01 13:39:18	na_th_an	it's somewhere in the middle
2017-05-01 13:39:24	na_th_an	you're more right than she is
2017-05-01 13:40:19	keveloper	matt damon being the lead for 'great wall of china'
2017-05-01 13:40:22	keveloper	that is an issue

2017-05-02 10:15:29	keveloper	it like set background images
2017-05-02 10:15:43	keveloper	gothalice was like 'if you was hiring and say this it would be an instant no'

2017-05-02 10:19:45	keveloper	lol
2017-05-02 10:20:04	keveloper	it looks like google doesnt use their own icon framework
2017-05-02 10:20:15	na_th_an	u sure
2017-05-02 10:20:30	keveloper	at least not the i tag part

2017-05-02 10:21:35	keveloper	because thats better
2017-05-02 10:21:54	na_th_an	lul
2017-05-02 10:22:12	keveloper	i dont get why <i> is such a bad idea
2017-05-02 10:22:32	na_th_an	idk, legacy bullshit
2017-05-02 10:22:33	keveloper	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11135261/should-i-use-i-tag-for-icons-instead-of-span
2017-05-02 10:22:41	keveloper	huh
2017-05-02 10:22:43	keveloper	i meant italics
2017-05-02 10:23:00	keveloper	it*
2017-05-02 10:23:04	na_th_an	yeah
2017-05-02 10:23:06	na_th_an	did you not know that
2017-05-02 10:23:11	keveloper	is it bad practice "awful"
2017-05-02 10:23:14	keveloper	no i knew that
2017-05-02 10:23:18	keveloper	i dont get what you mean by legacy bullshit
2017-05-02 10:23:37	na_th_an	just like, legacy accessibility bullshit from it being italics
2017-05-02 10:23:44	na_th_an	even though you're not supposed to use it any more
2017-05-02 10:23:49	na_th_an	legacy bullshit
2017-05-02 10:31:08	keveloper	like
2017-05-02 10:31:17	keveloper	im fine if i shouldnt use <i> but i need a good reason
2017-05-02 10:31:20	keveloper	because i havent heard one yet
2017-05-02 10:31:25	na_th_an	because it's not semantic
2017-05-02 10:31:32	keveloper	how
2017-05-02 10:31:33	na_th_an	and semantic markup is good
2017-05-02 10:31:37	keveloper	how is it not semantic
2017-05-02 10:31:39	na_th_an	because <i> is italics 
2017-05-02 10:31:41	na_th_an	WHY is it italics
2017-05-02 10:31:45	na_th_an	nobody knows
2017-05-02 10:31:48	na_th_an	the markup doesn't say why
2017-05-02 10:31:54	na_th_an	<em> means something
2017-05-02 10:32:00	na_th_an	it means that that text is emphasized
2017-05-02 10:32:01	keveloper	The HTML <i> element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, for example, technical terms, foreign language phrases, or fictional character thoughts. It is typically displayed in italic type.
2017-05-02 10:32:17	keveloper	Does an icon not match that def
2017-05-02 10:32:20	na_th_an	*shrug* 
2017-05-02 10:32:23	na_th_an	that's the reason
2017-05-02 10:32:29	keveloper	Because it sounds pretty close
2017-05-02 10:32:42	na_th_an	well an icon isn't text
2017-05-02 10:32:44	na_th_an	so I'd say no
2017-05-02 10:34:40	keveloper	ehhhhh
2017-05-02 10:35:04	na_th_an	"The HTML <i> element represents a range of text"
2017-05-02 10:35:06	na_th_an	an icon is not text
2017-05-02 10:35:09	keveloper	https://www.utf8icons.com/
2017-05-02 10:35:13	keveloper	are those not text
2017-05-02 10:35:23	na_th_an	no
2017-05-02 10:35:30	na_th_an	they are encoded the same way as text can be encoded
2017-05-02 10:35:37	na_th_an	but not text
2017-05-02 10:35:48	na_th_an	a picture of someone with their tongue sticking out is not text
2017-05-02 10:36:28	keveloper	idk
2017-05-02 10:37:40	na_th_an	do you have any use for a 100mbps network switch
2017-05-02 10:37:51	keveloper	uh
2017-05-02 10:37:56	keveloper	dont think so
2017-05-02 10:38:03	keveloper	maybe actually
2017-05-02 10:38:11	na_th_an	I meant to get a gbps one
2017-05-02 10:38:17	na_th_an	but accidentally got a 8 port 100mbps one
2017-05-02 10:38:29	na_th_an	I feel dishonest returning it because I opened it and shit and it's totally my fault and also I'm lazy
2017-05-02 10:38:38	na_th_an	and 100mbps is ok
2017-05-02 10:38:47	na_th_an	but if you want it I'd sell it to ya for $5
2017-05-02 10:38:55	keveloper	i dont think i could use it
2017-05-02 10:39:14	keveloper	what are you using it for
2017-05-02 10:39:54	keveloper	like
2017-05-02 10:39:56	keveloper	why is this better
2017-05-02 10:39:56	keveloper	  <span aria-hidden="true" data-icon="&#x25a8;"></span>
2017-05-02 10:39:57	keveloper	thats awful
2017-05-02 10:40:47	keveloper	or doing this <h2 id="stats" class="stats-title">Stats</h2>
2017-05-02 10:41:13	keveloper	then having stats-title specifically display the icon
2017-05-02 10:41:21	keveloper	abby is annoying
2017-05-02 10:41:45	na_th_an	lol
2017-05-02 10:42:09	na_th_an	true tho
2017-05-02 10:52:43	keveloper	so i guess im feature lead for like 3 epics now
2017-05-02 10:52:44	keveloper	uhh
2017-05-02 10:53:25	na_th_an	wut
2017-05-02 10:55:24	keveloper	i dont understand the fear of spiders
2017-05-02 10:55:47	na_th_an	I mean I sorta get it
2017-05-02 10:55:50	na_th_an	but not to that extent
2017-05-02 10:56:32	keveloper	i think she just wanted to goof off and act cute idk
2017-05-02 10:56:36	keveloper	no way she's actually afraid of that
2017-05-02 10:56:45	keveloper	it was literally like 2mm long
2017-05-02 10:56:56	keveloper	just kind standing there

2017-05-02 10:57:23	na_th_an	"ahh it's so gross"

2017-05-02 10:58:17	na_th_an	and hasn't coded anything since school
2017-05-02 10:58:20	keveloper	i think its out of fear of failling or something
2017-05-02 10:58:24	na_th_an	probably
2017-05-02 10:58:29	na_th_an	it's just like
2017-05-02 10:58:31	keveloper	because qa is easy
2017-05-02 10:58:35	na_th_an	if you're gonna talk the talk, then walk the walk

2017-05-02 11:25:41	na_th_an	jimmy has had build issues every single day it seems like
2017-05-02 11:26:01	na_th_an	he's spent whole days "trying to fix the build" after his stuff is done
2017-05-02 11:26:12	na_th_an	and then he's like "now I have like 8 merge conflicts"
2017-05-02 11:26:25	na_th_an	what am I doing different that I don't have these issues
2017-05-02 11:26:58	keveloper	not being shit

2017-05-02 11:30:01	keveloper	is that different
2017-05-02 11:30:02	na_th_an	because apparently breaking an epic into user stories is our job
2017-05-02 11:30:03	keveloper	after the design meeting?
2017-05-02 11:30:09	na_th_an	you groom the epic
2017-05-02 11:30:14	na_th_an	with product
2017-05-02 11:30:23	na_th_an	then with the feature team and tech leads you create the user stories
2017-05-02 11:30:24	na_th_an	design
2017-05-02 11:30:25	keveloper	ok so that later after the design meeting ok

2017-05-02 11:30:34	keveloper	ok wait wait
2017-05-02 11:30:38	na_th_an	then once you have that done
2017-05-02 11:30:39	keveloper	the epic went through grooming
2017-05-02 11:30:41	na_th_an	you have the solution review
2017-05-02 11:30:58	na_th_an	and you look at the user stories and everything with product and rashmi
2017-05-02 11:31:05	na_th_an	and are like "yes this is good"
2017-05-02 11:31:17	keveloper	ok
2017-05-02 11:46:17	na_th_an	i'm getting really tired of senior devs saying they're having build issues
2017-05-02 12:03:28	keveloper	sooo
2017-05-02 12:03:30	keveloper	north korea
2017-05-02 12:03:57	na_th_an	yea

2017-05-02 12:04:18	keveloper	whats gonna happen
2017-05-02 12:04:21	na_th_an	idk
2017-05-02 12:04:39	na_th_an	idk what nk's end game is here
2017-05-02 12:04:51	na_th_an	they're going pretty far if it's they're usual "give us food and we'll calm down"
2017-05-02 12:04:57	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-02 12:05:15	keveloper	i feel like if they do anything they are going to get pummeled by the rest of the world
2017-05-02 12:05:21	na_th_an	yeah
2017-05-02 12:05:24	na_th_an	and they must know that
2017-05-02 12:05:31	na_th_an	but there also must be a plan
2017-05-02 12:05:32	keveloper	idk do they
2017-05-02 12:05:35	na_th_an	like, they're insane
2017-05-02 12:05:40	na_th_an	but they're not illogical
2017-05-02 12:06:10	keveloper	i dont know much about it but i kind of support trumps agression
2017-05-02 12:06:14	keveloper	like their nuclear testing shit is not ok
2017-05-02 12:06:24	keveloper	i dont really know what trump has done though
2017-05-02 12:06:36	na_th_an	nothing
2017-05-02 12:06:43	na_th_an	he said he was gonna send an aircraft carrier over there
2017-05-02 12:06:47	na_th_an	but lied
2017-05-02 12:06:51	keveloper	oh
2017-05-02 12:06:53	na_th_an	it's actually going the other deriction
2017-05-02 12:06:57	na_th_an	so we'll see
2017-05-02 12:06:59	keveloper	hm
2017-05-02 12:07:15	na_th_an	it's a difficult situation that pretty much requires coorporation from china and sk
2017-05-02 12:07:24	na_th_an	but sk's government is sorta in shambles right now with a huge corruption thing
2017-05-02 12:07:29	keveloper	i doubt nk could successfully launch a missle to the US
2017-05-02 12:07:29	na_th_an	their former pres is in jail
2017-05-02 12:07:37	na_th_an	it's possible
2017-05-02 12:07:42	na_th_an	they have missiles that can reach the us
2017-05-02 12:07:49	na_th_an	they have nuclear warheads
2017-05-02 12:08:05	na_th_an	the thing is all they have to do is let a nuke off in space to create a EM blast that fucks us over
2017-05-02 12:08:19	na_th_an	but like, what's the end game for something lik ethat
2017-05-02 12:08:22	na_th_an	idk

2017-05-02 13:03:46	na_th_an	so you did work that QA never verified in DEV or NIT or NAT
2017-05-02 13:03:50	keveloper	correct

2017-05-02 13:04:01	na_th_an	wut
2017-05-02 13:04:21	keveloper	the DC and DUI parts are there
2017-05-02 13:04:23	keveloper	no DS part
2017-05-02 13:04:52	keveloper	k well
2017-05-02 13:09:02	na_th_an	mallesh has 3 commits that are labelled 
2017-05-02 13:09:04	na_th_an	"WIP"
2017-05-02 13:09:06	na_th_an	srsly
2017-05-02 13:09:16	keveloper	lol link
2017-05-02 13:09:36	keveloper	so abby didn't test this feature in dev, nit, or nat
2017-05-02 13:09:53	keveloper	it literally only worked on the fb
2017-05-02 13:09:58	keveloper	idk how i forgot to merge this but
2017-05-02 13:10:13	na_th_an	i saw it in an email
2017-05-02 13:10:15	na_th_an	and ya
2017-05-02 13:10:22	na_th_an	like obv you missed merging it into integration
2017-05-02 13:10:38	na_th_an	but it's a much bigger miss for qa to have verified dev nit nat csdc without realizing that's broken
2017-05-02 13:11:31	keveloper	it kinda looks like the features is there
2017-05-02 13:11:37	keveloper	but changing the defaults in DC doesn't do anything in DUI
2017-05-02 13:15:05	keveloper	bleh
2017-05-02 13:15:09	keveloper	idk how i didn't do this rip
2017-05-02 13:15:26	keveloper	i remember thinking 'okay i have to merge all of the epics to master'
2017-05-02 13:15:27	na_th_an	rip
2017-05-02 13:15:32	keveloper	then i was like 'okay i have merged all of the epics'
2017-05-02 14:35:25	keveloper	"but it sounds like a guy who breaks into your house and rapes you" lmao
2017-05-02 14:37:05	keveloper	“Life is simple. Are you happy? Yes? Keep going. No? Change something.”
2017-05-02 14:37:10	keveloper	my momentum quote rn

2017-05-02 14:37:36	na_th_an	“The path to wisdom is paved with humility.”
2017-05-02 14:37:48	na_th_an	tbf you're not the inspirational quote kind of guy
2017-05-02 14:38:08	keveloper	what
2017-05-02 14:38:13	keveloper	i like inspirational quotes
2017-05-02 14:38:25	keveloper	but "are you happy" is a pretty complicated question to answer i think

2017-05-03 09:23:07	na_th_an	i think your poop would still be poop
2017-05-03 09:57:11	keveloper	everyday i think binaebi is worse at ui design
2017-05-03 10:00:58	na_th_an	yeah...
2017-05-03 10:01:11	na_th_an	I have nothing to say to defend her
2017-05-03 10:01:19	keveloper	meanwhile i made this by hand kevinholland.me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-05-03 10:01:20	keveloper	just sayin
2017-05-03 10:02:29	keveloper	do you remember how to release social ws
2017-05-03 10:02:32	keveloper	like what you select
2017-05-03 10:02:46	na_th_an	cut new release?
2017-05-03 10:02:49	na_th_an	or recut current release
2017-05-03 10:03:05	keveloper	u sure
2017-05-03 10:03:14	na_th_an	i think
2017-05-03 10:03:19	na_th_an	it depends on what you see
2017-05-03 10:06:12	keveloper	i wonder what DUI would look like in a year if I was put in charge of UI/UX lol
2017-05-03 10:06:32	keveloper	like i know binaebi has a bunch of knowledge i don't in the UX area
2017-05-03 10:06:40	keveloper	but she just seems not very good at design
2017-05-03 10:06:46	na_th_an	yeah
2017-05-03 10:07:25	keveloper	what you think of my portfolio
2017-05-03 10:07:27	keveloper	any feedback
2017-05-03 10:08:00	na_th_an	it looks good
2017-05-03 10:08:02	na_th_an	idk
2017-05-03 10:08:12	keveloper	is that all lol
2017-05-03 10:08:22	na_th_an	I joined #datahoarr last night and there's been no talk of data storage at all
2017-05-03 10:08:26	na_th_an	datahoarder*
2017-05-03 10:08:29	na_th_an	and idk man it looks good
2017-05-03 10:08:36	keveloper	lol ok
2017-05-03 10:09:57	na_th_an	there's a pull request to dui that's been open for 7 buisenss days
2017-05-03 10:10:00	na_th_an	business
2017-05-03 10:10:28	keveloper	is it yings
2017-05-03 10:10:33	na_th_an	no
2017-05-03 10:10:35	na_th_an	mallesh
2017-05-03 10:10:44	keveloper	yings are too big
2017-05-03 10:10:50	na_th_an	yes
2017-05-03 10:12:46	keveloper	i think this thing can be groovified
2017-05-03 10:12:51	keveloper	but idk if im being dumb
2017-05-03 10:13:02	keveloper	she instantiates a map, puts, returns map
2017-05-03 10:13:14	keveloper	same thing as ['stuff':val,'stuff2':val2]
2017-05-03 10:13:15	keveloper	k ya
2017-05-03 10:13:33	na_th_an	>_>
2017-05-03 10:13:40	keveloper	wait did i do something stupid
2017-05-03 10:13:44	keveloper	im tired and sick man i cant think
2017-05-03 10:13:44	na_th_an	no
2017-05-03 10:32:11	na_th_an	i wonder how many people in this company know what "string interpolation" is
2017-05-03 10:32:17	na_th_an	or a "unary operator"
2017-05-03 10:32:30	na_th_an	or other technical terms like that
2017-05-03 10:32:46	na_th_an	technical programming term trivia would be fun
2017-05-03 10:33:24	keveloper	idk nobody calls it string interpolation
2017-05-03 10:33:33	keveloper	and when would you ever use the term unary operator
2017-05-03 10:33:59	na_th_an	i mean I just googled "scala string interpolation"
2017-05-03 10:34:04	na_th_an	because that's what I wanted
2017-05-03 10:34:17	na_th_an	and I'd use the term unary operator when looking up operators for a new language
2017-05-03 10:34:18	keveloper	you could also google scala string substituion tho
2017-05-03 10:34:27	keveloper	ya fair
2017-05-03 11:04:25	keveloper	yo
2017-05-03 11:04:27	keveloper	design question
2017-05-03 11:04:40	na_th_an	k
2017-05-03 11:04:46	keveloper	if i want to create a List<Suggestion>
2017-05-03 11:04:50	keveloper	from List<String>
2017-05-03 11:05:00	keveloper	the string look like "hye:hey"
2017-05-03 11:05:15	keveloper	Suggestion has two fields: source, suggestion
2017-05-03 11:05:23	keveloper	So something needs to parse that out and make a list
2017-05-03 11:05:32	keveloper	that shouldn't be called a factory
2017-05-03 11:05:38	na_th_an	spring converter string -> suggestion
2017-05-03 11:05:53	na_th_an	strings.collect { convert(it, blah blah) }
2017-05-03 11:06:01	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-03 11:06:17	keveloper	SuggestionStringToObjectConverter
2017-05-03 11:06:17	keveloper	??
2017-05-03 11:06:21	keveloper	uhh
2017-05-03 11:06:21	na_th_an	I think in "classic" java that would be a place where you'd use a factory though
2017-05-03 11:06:27	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-03 11:06:30	na_th_an	don't you want a StringToSuggestionConverter
2017-05-03 11:06:42	keveloper	yeah i guess
2017-05-03 11:06:48	keveloper	but like
2017-05-03 11:06:57	keveloper	i want to be clear that its a SuggestionString
2017-05-03 11:07:04	keveloper	like a string that looks like "hye:hey"
2017-05-03 11:07:08	na_th_an	there's no t much you can do about that
2017-05-03 11:07:12	na_th_an	in Haskell...... you cav
2017-05-03 11:07:14	na_th_an	can
2017-05-03 11:07:16	keveloper	does ds even have converters
2017-05-03 11:07:20	na_th_an	but java's type system isn't descriptive enough for that
2017-05-03 11:07:22	na_th_an	oh idk maybe not
2017-05-03 11:07:28	na_th_an	see how other shit is converted in ds and use that
2017-05-03 11:07:36	na_th_an	i figured you were talking dui
2017-05-03 11:07:45	keveloper	there is one converter lol
2017-05-03 11:08:01	keveloper	conversionService is nowhere in the project
2017-05-03 11:08:39	keveloper	oh they just include the resource and do specificConverter.convert
2017-05-03 11:09:29	na_th_an	is veam like 300lbs
2017-05-03 11:09:36	na_th_an	how does a bottle of wine only get him tipsy
2017-05-03 11:09:42	keveloper	lol idk
2017-05-03 11:10:11	keveloper	one bottle of wine gets your pretty drunk
2017-05-03 11:10:12	keveloper	like
2017-05-03 11:10:14	na_th_an	yeah
2017-05-03 11:10:16	keveloper	PRETTTTTy drunk lol
2017-05-03 11:10:24	na_th_an	one bottle to myself would put me out pretty hard
2017-05-03 11:10:37	keveloper	wtf
2017-05-03 11:10:51	na_th_an	maybe he's drinking smaller bottles of low abv?
2017-05-03 11:12:17	keveloper	idk
2017-05-03 11:13:37	keveloper	dude that guy is going no where
2017-05-03 11:13:48	keveloper	if he's not lying/exaggerating
2017-05-03 11:13:49	na_th_an	it seems like it
2017-05-03 11:13:51	keveloper	hes like skipping class
2017-05-03 11:13:56	keveloper	seems to be an alcoholic
2017-05-03 11:14:05	keveloper	and is quitting school because its too expensive
2017-05-03 11:14:08	na_th_an	tbh you'd have probably said that about me at his age too
2017-05-03 11:14:12	na_th_an	I wasn't quitting school
2017-05-03 11:14:14	keveloper	it was like $6k a year or something
2017-05-03 11:14:18	na_th_an	but I was spending time on acid on irc
2017-05-03 11:14:32	keveloper	he doesn't have any scholarships
2017-05-03 11:14:36	na_th_an	but ya it seem like he's not going anywhere
2017-05-03 11:14:39	keveloper	or loans
2017-05-03 11:14:40	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-03 11:14:40	keveloper	rip
2017-05-03 11:14:44	na_th_an	does not really plan on graduating
2017-05-03 11:14:51	na_th_an	rip
2017-05-03 11:16:00	keveloper	lousiana sounds great
2017-05-03 11:16:10	na_th_an	yup
2017-05-03 11:16:28	keveloper	im sure he's not right though
2017-05-03 11:16:36	keveloper	like that was probably his experience in his bubble
2017-05-03 11:16:55	keveloper	also i doubt he can barely feel it after 1 full bottle of wine
2017-05-03 11:17:11	na_th_an	maybe he drinks slow
2017-05-03 11:17:22	keveloper	maybe
2017-05-03 11:17:28	na_th_an	drink slow, low abv, genetic tolerance, plus being an alcoholic
2017-05-03 11:17:29	keveloper	he just said "i need to get 3 bottles of wine"
2017-05-03 11:17:43	keveloper	or being 19 and trying to seem cool
2017-05-03 11:17:51	keveloper	one of those is more likely
2017-05-03 11:18:24	na_th_an	true
2017-05-03 11:18:30	na_th_an	he's probably exaggerating a bit
2017-05-03 11:20:11	keveloper	would you skydive
2017-05-03 11:20:15	keveloper	do you think abby would skydive
2017-05-03 11:20:22	na_th_an	maybe
2017-05-03 11:20:23	na_th_an	and no
2017-05-03 11:20:34	keveloper	how much faster do you think she would fall
2017-05-03 11:20:44	na_th_an	not that much faster
2017-05-03 11:20:50	keveloper	a lil bit though
2017-05-03 11:20:53	keveloper	i think
2017-05-03 11:20:53	keveloper	idk
2017-05-03 11:20:54	na_th_an	maybe
2017-05-03 11:21:05	na_th_an	if we were the same dimensions that'd be true
2017-05-03 11:21:12	keveloper	i dont think her frontal area would provide enough resistance to equal out with us tho
2017-05-03 11:21:15	na_th_an	she'd have a slightly higher terminal veloc}y
2017-05-03 11:21:32	na_th_an	but yeah increased air resistence would probably about balance that out
2017-05-03 11:21:44	keveloper	idk man
2017-05-03 11:21:55	keveloper	how much do you think she weighs
2017-05-03 11:22:06	na_th_an	um
2017-05-03 11:22:12	na_th_an	idk i'd feel mean guessing
2017-05-03 11:22:18	na_th_an	becaus I feel like it's a lot
2017-05-03 11:22:19	keveloper	idk how much i weigh
2017-05-03 11:22:26	keveloper	i think i weigh like 175
2017-05-03 11:22:27	na_th_an	I'm 145 usually
2017-05-03 11:22:33	keveloper	ime 175 or 180
2017-05-03 11:22:34	na_th_an	I go between 140 and 145
2017-05-03 11:22:39	keveloper	u small
2017-05-03 11:22:47	na_th_an	ya
2017-05-03 11:22:51	keveloper	i bet abby is only like 210
2017-05-03 11:23:11	keveloper	cause she's shorter than me and probably has less muscle
2017-05-03 11:23:16	keveloper	and muscle weighs more
2017-05-03 11:23:28	keveloper	hm maybe we would fall faster
2017-05-03 11:23:35	na_th_an	I'd bet she's more honestly
2017-05-03 11:23:48	keveloper	the proportional difference in weight would be not as much because we'd also have people strapped to our backs
2017-05-03 11:24:27	keveloper	remember this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qF_fzEI4wU
2017-05-03 11:24:46	na_th_an	ya
2017-05-03 11:24:55	na_th_an	we need to get teafordc to listen to weak music this afternoon
2017-05-03 11:25:04	keveloper	week
2017-05-03 11:25:07	keveloper	yeah why has he not
2017-05-03 11:25:21	na_th_an	he usually listens from his phone is why i think
2017-05-03 11:25:53	keveloper	oh what why
2017-05-03 11:25:55	keveloper	why would u do that
2017-05-03 11:26:03	na_th_an	idk
2017-05-03 13:04:06	keveloper	hey
2017-05-03 13:04:18	keveloper	so sometimes a string shouldn't return a spelling suggestion
2017-05-03 13:05:41	na_th_an	ok
2017-05-03 13:05:51	keveloper	so should i return null or
2017-05-03 13:06:19	na_th_an	from what
2017-05-03 13:06:21	na_th_an	to what
2017-05-03 13:06:24	na_th_an	context can help
2017-05-03 13:06:30	keveloper	so
2017-05-03 13:06:31	keveloper	if its
2017-05-03 13:06:37	keveloper	"hello:hello"
2017-05-03 13:06:45	keveloper	there shouldn't be an object for that
2017-05-03 13:06:54	keveloper	lol
2017-05-03 13:07:00	keveloper	how long until he realizes we are joking
2017-05-03 13:07:15	keveloper	actually
2017-05-03 13:07:19	keveloper	this is dumb i don't think this matters
2017-05-03 13:07:23	keveloper	nvm
2017-05-03 13:07:24	keveloper	bye
2017-05-03 13:18:39	na_th_an	"How do you want to track this work? Do you want us to open an incident? Or should I open a service now request?"
2017-05-03 13:18:54	na_th_an	reply: "We will need to track this work. Can you give us the source IPs and destination IPs?"
2017-05-03 13:19:02	na_th_an	both of which were in my first email >_>
2017-05-03 13:20:15	keveloper	checkout my bridge and also shitty office building thing i made two years ago oin auto cad lol http://imgur.com/a/w1hxV
2017-05-03 13:20:24	keveloper	lol
2017-05-03 13:20:32	keveloper	lol @ the thing u said
2017-05-03 13:20:43	na_th_an	it just pisses me offf that the networking team has to be so spoon fed
2017-05-03 13:20:53	keveloper	yeah idk
2017-05-03 13:20:56	na_th_an	I feel like I should be able to say "production DiscoveryCite can't connect to this url"
2017-05-03 13:21:03	keveloper	and they fix it
2017-05-03 13:21:06	na_th_an	and they should be able to go to prod amp and see what discovery cite hosts are
2017-05-03 13:21:08	na_th_an	and what the url is
2017-05-03 13:21:14	na_th_an	instead of me having to go do nslookups
2017-05-03 13:21:16	na_th_an	and copy and paste the result
2017-05-03 13:21:19	na_th_an	that's just stupid
2017-05-03 13:22:02	keveloper	y aowrd
2017-05-03 13:31:40	keveloper	hey
2017-05-03 13:31:49	keveloper	if 'hello:hello' should the converter just return null
2017-05-03 13:32:18	na_th_an	idk
2017-05-03 13:32:25	na_th_an	optional would be better if possible
2017-05-03 13:32:31	na_th_an	it's not good to return nulls
2017-05-03 13:32:41	na_th_an	but it's not the worst
2017-05-03 13:32:51	keveloper	what do you mean optional
2017-05-03 13:33:02	na_th_an	Optional
2017-05-03 13:33:05	na_th_an	java 8 
2017-05-03 13:33:09	keveloper	i dont see how that applies here
2017-05-03 13:33:18	na_th_an	this is what optional is for
2017-05-03 13:33:24	na_th_an	when a method might return a value
2017-05-03 13:33:26	na_th_an	or it might return null
2017-05-03 13:33:41	na_th_an	Optional lets you return "null" without returning a null object
2017-05-03 13:33:54	na_th_an	and then gives you useful methods for extracting the object
2017-05-03 13:34:02	na_th_an	like, orElseThrow
2017-05-03 13:34:08	na_th_an	or orElse to give a default object
2017-05-03 13:34:26	na_th_an	that's literally why they put optional into java
2017-05-03 13:34:41	na_th_an	is so you don't have to return null and check if (var != null)
2017-05-03 13:36:03	na_th_an	our qa person is asking for a patron sign un
2017-05-03 13:36:05	na_th_an	sign on
2017-05-03 13:36:10	na_th_an	that's not worrisome at all
2017-05-03 13:36:19	keveloper	wait what
2017-05-03 13:36:31	keveloper	oh
2017-05-03 13:36:36	keveloper	hmm

2017-05-03 13:39:32	na_th_an	"I can do _____ to change this redirect rule, is that ok for you?"

2017-05-04 09:12:46	na_th_an	pretty much
2017-05-04 09:12:50	na_th_an	but I put this in my eye
2017-05-04 09:14:33	na_th_an	business words are like newspeak in 1984
2017-05-04 09:14:45	na_th_an	instead of calling them "bugs" we call them "opportunitiesh'
2017-05-04 09:14:51	na_th_an	wtf is that

2017-05-04 09:20:58	na_th_an	I wonder how "mandatory" it is
2017-05-04 09:22:13	keveloper	omg its  like a college assignemnt
2017-05-04 09:22:16	keveloper	https://insideoclc.sharepoint.com/sites/gsit/isa/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B61FBBEC2-B8C0-4E23-BBED-12E14279E3B0%7D&file=OCLC%20Developer%20Security%20Awareness%20Annual%20Training%202017.docx&action=default
2017-05-04 09:22:35	keveloper	oh wait jk
2017-05-04 09:22:41	keveloper	still tho
2017-05-04 09:22:59	keveloper	its very not mandatory
2017-05-04 09:23:13	keveloper	i says "plz dont send the answer to GSS; thse are for your use only"
2017-05-04 09:23:44	keveloper	there's nothing to do
2017-05-04 09:23:47	keveloper	it just that document
2017-05-04 09:23:56	na_th_an	lol
2017-05-04 09:24:05	na_th_an	so exactly as mandatory as the last mandatory security training that barely anyone did
2017-05-04 09:24:32	na_th_an	i got the 1080ti btw
2017-05-04 09:24:37	na_th_an	I had to move hard drives in my case to make it fit
2017-05-04 09:24:41	na_th_an	it's yyyuuuuuugee
2017-05-04 09:24:48	na_th_an	then I played vr and it was cool
2017-05-04 09:24:52	keveloper	wow :o
2017-05-04 09:24:59	keveloper	how much better is the ti
2017-05-04 09:25:08	keveloper	did rich your 1080
2017-05-04 09:25:14	na_th_an	idk exactly and yes
2017-05-04 09:25:29	keveloper	was there a notable difference in vr
2017-05-04 09:25:32	na_th_an	this will be the best consumer grade card on the market for like 2 years
2017-05-04 09:25:42	keveloper	titan
2017-05-04 09:25:51	na_th_an	I need to up my super sampling which I didn't do
2017-05-04 09:25:54	na_th_an	so no real difference yet
2017-05-04 09:25:57	na_th_an	and titan isn't consumer grade
2017-05-04 09:26:04	keveloper	rly
2017-05-04 09:26:07	na_th_an	titan is hte professional enterprise computing grade
2017-05-04 09:26:15	na_th_an	ya they're meant for enterprise computing
2017-05-04 09:26:18	na_th_an	like CUDA and CAD
2017-05-04 09:26:19	na_th_an	not gaming
2017-05-04 09:26:25	keveloper	ah
2017-05-04 09:26:26	na_th_an	they're obv really good at gaming
2017-05-04 09:26:31	na_th_an	but that's not the target market
2017-05-04 09:27:27	keveloper	so basically read the top 10 OWASP web vulnerabilies and read the SANS SWAT checklist
2017-05-04 09:27:29	keveloper	thats the training
2017-05-04 09:27:51	na_th_an	10x better than last year's training
2017-05-04 09:29:50	keveloper	number 1 is still injection
2017-05-04 09:29:57	keveloper	2 is broken auth or session managment
2017-05-04 09:30:11	keveloper	3 is XSS
2017-05-04 09:30:29	keveloper	broken access control what does that mean
2017-05-04 09:30:46	na_th_an	being able to access endpoints you're not authorized to
2017-05-04 09:30:53	keveloper	oh
2017-05-04 09:30:56	keveloper	underportected apis
2017-05-04 09:30:58	na_th_an	it's related to authentication vs authorization
2017-05-04 09:31:33	na_th_an	sometimes ying talks like people in the bible
2017-05-04 09:31:39	na_th_an	"It is good to haev early feedback from you."
2017-05-04 09:31:53	keveloper	Application functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented
2017-05-04 09:31:53	keveloper	incorrectly
2017-05-04 09:31:54	keveloper	:)
2017-05-04 09:32:10	keveloper	glad we wrote our own
2017-05-04 09:32:20	na_th_an	we use spring?
2017-05-04 09:32:24	keveloper	wskey/idm
2017-05-04 09:32:27	keveloper	not discovery
2017-05-04 09:32:31	na_th_an	we didn't write our own authentication and session management
2017-05-04 09:32:38	keveloper	i meant oclc
2017-05-04 09:32:47	keveloper	authentication yes
2017-05-04 09:32:54	na_th_an	wskey/idm is an implementation of oauth2 so idk 
2017-05-04 09:33:13	keveloper	im sure they did something wrong
2017-05-04 09:33:46	na_th_an	I doubt they rolled their own oauth2 implementation from scratch
2017-05-04 09:33:56	na_th_an	it's not like it's an uncommon thing to od
2017-05-04 09:33:59	na_th_an	there are libraries
2017-05-04 09:34:19	keveloper	from how the SS team explained it to me it seems that way
2017-05-04 09:34:52	keveloper	because WSKey 1 was or 1.5 was not oauth, and then they made WSKey 2 which was oauth  but still has a lot of parts from the old wskey
2017-05-04 09:35:18	na_th_an	well sure 
2017-05-04 09:35:28	na_th_an	that doesn't imply that they made their own oauth implementation
2017-05-04 09:35:42	keveloper	dui seems p secure from reading this
2017-05-04 09:36:14	na_th_an	we've got some holes but nothing major
2017-05-04 09:36:37	na_th_an	but we're not protecting anything too valuable
2017-05-04 09:36:42	keveloper	true
2017-05-04 09:36:45	keveloper	there's no pii i dont think
2017-05-04 09:36:50	keveloper	literally anywhere in dui
2017-05-04 09:37:00	keveloper	besides user/pass that idm handles
2017-05-04 09:37:42	keveloper	ah we are
2017-05-04 09:37:53	keveloper	there is contact information on the my account page

2017-05-04 09:37:58	na_th_an	ya
2017-05-04 09:38:05	na_th_an	but they wanna move that to user portal
2017-05-04 09:38:09	keveloper	where is this stored
2017-05-04 09:38:37	na_th_an	where is what stored
2017-05-04 09:39:41	keveloper	name/address
2017-05-04 09:39:48	na_th_an	we don't store it anywhere
2017-05-04 09:39:52	na_th_an	i think it comes from circ
2017-05-04 09:48:40	keveloper	badly
2017-05-04 09:48:57	keveloper	'need to get it cut very badly'
2017-05-04 09:50:23	na_th_an	fuck u
2017-05-04 09:51:25	keveloper	my car will be paid of in 2 years and 4 months
2017-05-04 09:51:31	keveloper	\o/
2017-05-04 09:51:42	na_th_an	\o/

2017-05-04 10:30:21	na_th_an	I'd bet not that hard
2017-05-04 10:39:15	keveloper	blerpdalerb
2017-05-04 10:39:19	keveloper	my throat hurts
2017-05-04 10:39:28	na_th_an	go home
2017-05-04 10:39:29	na_th_an	or wfh
2017-05-04 10:39:46	keveloper	i want to get shit done
2017-05-04 10:39:53	keveloper	oh
2017-05-04 10:40:02	keveloper	i watched half of the red pill with quinton and his gf last night
2017-05-04 10:56:11	keveloper	i was expecting a reaction to that lol
2017-05-04 10:57:02	na_th_an	oh I didn't see it
2017-05-04 10:57:09	keveloper	what you think bout that lol
2017-05-04 10:57:10	na_th_an	half of the red pill?_
2017-05-04 10:57:17	keveloper	the documentary
2017-05-04 10:57:18	na_th_an	is there a movie called the red pill
2017-05-04 10:57:20	keveloper	the red pill
2017-05-04 10:57:21	na_th_an	oh
2017-05-04 10:57:21	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-04 10:57:26	na_th_an	I guess I didn't know there was a documentary
2017-05-04 10:57:28	keveloper	its about the mens rights movement or whatever
2017-05-04 10:57:32	keveloper	made by some feminist
2017-05-04 10:57:44	na_th_an	I bet it's a fair view
2017-05-04 10:57:49	keveloper	it is
2017-05-04 10:57:52	keveloper	its about like
2017-05-04 10:58:04	keveloper	how only men are required to be in the selective service
2017-05-04 10:58:16	keveloper	and how 96% of dangerous jobs are filled by men
2017-05-04 10:58:19	keveloper	and uhh
2017-05-04 10:58:31	keveloper	75% of suicides are men
2017-05-04 10:58:33	na_th_an	so it's not just bashing MRAs because that's normally what I read whenever feminists talk about men's rights
2017-05-04 10:58:44	na_th_an	and MRAs spend all their time bashing feminists
2017-05-04 10:58:52	keveloper	no its not bashing
2017-05-04 10:58:57	keveloper	its pretty unbiased
2017-05-04 10:58:58	na_th_an	that's good
2017-05-04 10:59:15	keveloper	she has vlogs in it where she's talking through their points and stuff and she can't decide whether or not she support it or not
2017-05-04 10:59:43	keveloper	a guy in it has a good point about how the distance from A to B is equivalent from B to A
2017-05-04 10:59:53	keveloper	so like if women say men can't understand their issues
2017-05-04 11:00:03	keveloper	then how can women understand mens' issues
2017-05-04 11:00:17	keveloper	its definitely a hard sell but there are some good points
2017-05-04 11:00:44	keveloper	81% of custody cases go to the woman
2017-05-04 11:00:47	keveloper	stuff like that
2017-05-04 11:00:59	keveloper	rape issues
2017-05-04 11:01:12	na_th_an	yeah there are real men's issues that aren't talked about often
2017-05-04 11:01:16	keveloper	something like more men than women are raped
2017-05-04 11:01:30	keveloper	she interviewed some feminists about it and they were very uninformed about what it actually was
2017-05-04 11:01:35	keveloper	and they are so like "ITS US AGAINST THEM"
2017-05-04 11:01:37	keveloper	its ridiculous
2017-05-04 11:01:41	na_th_an	yea
2017-05-04 11:01:52	keveloper	they also had a point that patriarchy is a result of society not vise versa
2017-05-04 11:02:06	keveloper	men did not create the patriachical society
2017-05-04 11:02:11	keveloper	was their point
2017-05-04 11:02:25	keveloper	and also they don't want the patriachical society
2017-05-04 11:02:38	na_th_an	some of them definitely do
2017-05-04 11:02:57	keveloper	well i mean based on what their spokesperson said i mean
2017-05-04 11:03:13	na_th_an	there are men like us (hopefully) who listen to donald trump's "grab em by the pussy" statement and think "that's fucking disgusting, what a terrible person"
2017-05-04 11:03:16	keveloper	everything is really just shitty gender roles
2017-05-04 11:03:20	na_th_an	but thene there are others who think "I want to be in that position"
2017-05-04 11:03:52	keveloper	the "you are x gender and are expected by society to be ___" goes both ways
2017-05-04 11:03:59	na_th_an	yea
2017-05-04 11:04:02	keveloper	was basically the whole thing
2017-05-04 11:04:09	keveloper	and feminists were so pissed about it
2017-05-04 11:04:12	na_th_an	so it wasn't about the subreddit
2017-05-04 11:04:16	keveloper	no lol
2017-05-04 11:04:22	keveloper	it was about what the subreddit is based on
2017-05-04 11:04:25	na_th_an	did you hear that one of the mods of that subreddit was fonud out
2017-05-04 11:04:27	keveloper	but apparently the subreddit is cancer
2017-05-04 11:04:31	na_th_an	and he's a new hampshire legisature
2017-05-04 11:04:34	keveloper	oh wow
2017-05-04 11:04:34	na_th_an	yes the subreddit is cancer
2017-05-04 11:04:47	na_th_an	if you read through some of the posts there's like 10% of truth to them and 90% "holy shit"
2017-05-04 11:05:09	keveloper	they were saying that the momuments to veterans and statues of soldiers is a bribe to convince men to want to sacrifice their life for their country
2017-05-04 11:05:14	keveloper	idk about that one
2017-05-04 11:05:31	na_th_an	I mean some of the things they talk about have underlying truths
2017-05-04 11:05:39	na_th_an	but the conclusions they draw from those truths are way off base
2017-05-04 11:05:41	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-04 11:05:57	keveloper	oh also the women and children first thing
2017-05-04 11:06:11	keveloper	about how womens lives are valued higher than mens
2017-05-04 11:06:21	keveloper	which i think also goes back to an early cultre/biological thing
2017-05-04 11:06:26	na_th_an	a lot of it does
2017-05-04 11:06:37	na_th_an	a lot of it goes back to men being stronger and women bearing children
2017-05-04 11:06:38	keveloper	the idea that anybody is in control of it is stupid
2017-05-04 11:06:41	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-04 11:06:50	na_th_an	there are real biological differences between men and women
2017-05-04 11:06:52	keveloper	also 1 man can impregnate 10 women
2017-05-04 11:06:53	na_th_an	physical and mental
2017-05-04 11:07:00	keveloper	1 women cant be impregnated by 10 men
2017-05-04 11:07:07	na_th_an	also 
2017-05-04 11:07:15	keveloper	so women are more valuable to the survival of the species
2017-05-04 11:07:22	keveloper	which obviously isn't really an issue anymore but
2017-05-04 11:07:30	na_th_an	I'll start giving a shit about movements to get women into technology when there's equal focus to get men into child care and early childhood education
2017-05-04 11:07:36	keveloper	the traditions and cultural aspects of that live on naturally
2017-05-04 11:07:42	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-04 11:07:48	keveloper	or also get women into dangerous jobs
2017-05-04 11:07:50	na_th_an	yeah
2017-05-04 11:07:59	na_th_an	nobody wants to get gender equality in garbage collection
2017-05-04 11:08:11	keveloper	the feminists movement talks about getting women into CEO jobs and shit like that but they never talk about the unbalance in danerous and unwanted jobs
2017-05-04 11:08:20	keveloper	which >90% men
2017-05-04 11:08:24	na_th_an	yeah
2017-05-04 11:08:27	na_th_an	they definitely do
2017-05-04 11:08:38	na_th_an	that's one of the legit things I see from MRAs a lot
2017-05-04 11:08:54	keveloper	also one of the big feminists in it was being interviewed about MRAsd
2017-05-04 11:09:22	keveloper	and she was like "they feel threatened that women can now take their jobs and theres more competition and the mens rights movement is backlash becauset they are afraid"
2017-05-04 11:09:24	keveloper	and im like
2017-05-04 11:09:25	keveloper	"WAT
2017-05-04 11:09:35	keveloper	"HAVE YOU LITERALLY HEARD ANY OF THEIR ARGUMENTS"
2017-05-04 11:09:35	na_th_an	lol
2017-05-04 11:09:41	keveloper	this is like a big spokesperson of feminism
2017-05-04 11:09:43	keveloper	i forget her name
2017-05-04 11:09:54	keveloper	im sure some of the MRA people suck
2017-05-04 11:10:12	na_th_an	a lot of them do tbh
2017-05-04 11:10:16	na_th_an	/r/mensrights is pretty cancer
2017-05-04 11:10:20	keveloper	but from what the founders/spokepeople believe and preach it seems like a good movement
2017-05-04 11:10:26	keveloper	its really about gender equality
2017-05-04 11:10:28	keveloper	from both sides
2017-05-04 11:10:37	keveloper	we shouldn't be focusing on either side of it
2017-05-04 11:10:41	keveloper	feminism or mens rights
2017-05-04 11:10:45	keveloper	it should just be gender equality
2017-05-04 11:10:46	na_th_an	yeah whenever I talk to haley about this she's like "feminism means gender equality, they fight for both sides"
2017-05-04 11:10:53	keveloper	i dont think thats true
2017-05-04 11:10:58	keveloper	like maybe by definiton
2017-05-04 11:10:58	na_th_an	yeah
2017-05-04 11:11:06	keveloper	but haley knows better than most that usage becomes the definition
2017-05-04 11:11:08	na_th_an	that's like saying we only need one anti-cancer foundation
2017-05-04 11:11:15	na_th_an	because all cancers are bad
2017-05-04 11:11:23	na_th_an	no, we need to focus on certain issues for certain cancers
2017-05-04 11:11:28	na_th_an	like gettin women to get mammograms
2017-05-04 11:11:43	na_th_an	or getting men to get prostate exams
2017-05-04 11:11:52	na_th_an	because more men die of prostate cancer than women of breast cancer
2017-05-04 11:11:58	keveloper	there were some examples of women putting a baby up for adoption when the dad didn't know the baby existed
2017-05-04 11:12:04	na_th_an	but there isn't as much money in campaigning for fingers up butts than boobs 
2017-05-04 11:12:09	keveloper	and he had to fight for like 18 months and $150k to get the baby
2017-05-04 11:12:16	keveloper	and i think he got like visiting hours on weekends
2017-05-04 11:12:26	na_th_an	"no that doesn't actually happen" - feminists
2017-05-04 11:12:31	keveloper	he found out and took action before the family signed adoption papers
2017-05-04 11:12:39	keveloper	and got weekend visiting hours
2017-05-04 11:12:41	keveloper	like wtf
2017-05-04 11:13:04	keveloper	also the whole lindsey could have accused me of rape at any point (even now) and i'd probably go to jail
2017-05-04 11:13:07	keveloper	maybe not anymore but
2017-05-04 11:13:17	keveloper	a whole lot of people would hate be for no reason other than accusation
2017-05-04 11:13:27	na_th_an	it's like when my mom was against gay marriage and I was like "there are people that aren't able to be beside their loved ones on their death bed because they aren't immediate family" and my mom said "I don't think that happens"
2017-05-04 11:13:28	keveloper	but if it were the other way around and i say lindsey raped me no one would really care
2017-05-04 11:13:42	na_th_an	and then if it was found out that she was lying nothing would happen to her
2017-05-04 11:13:51	na_th_an	there was a girl that lied about a rape and a dude spent 4 years in jail
2017-05-04 11:13:51	keveloper	right
2017-05-04 11:14:02	keveloper	there was a guy that was raped
2017-05-04 11:14:03	na_th_an	she admitted her lie and is getting 1 month of weekend community service
2017-05-04 11:14:05	keveloper	and went to jail for 15 years
2017-05-04 11:14:06	keveloper	then got out
2017-05-04 11:14:10	keveloper	and had to pay child support
2017-05-04 11:14:17	na_th_an	yeah I heard about that
2017-05-04 11:14:35	keveloper	lindsey definitely raped me one time
2017-05-04 11:14:48	na_th_an	:(
2017-05-04 11:14:48	keveloper	it was at least not consentual
2017-05-04 11:14:53	keveloper	it was in her dorm
2017-05-04 11:14:58	keveloper	and she was like trying to have sex with me
2017-05-04 11:15:06	keveloper	and i was telling her to stop and that i didnt want it but she kept jumping on me
2017-05-04 11:15:16	na_th_an	men always want sex tho
2017-05-04 11:15:16	keveloper	and i didnt want like push her off or hurt her or anything
2017-05-04 11:15:54	keveloper	and i didn't want to cause a big scene or anything because it was in a dorm and i know she is emotionally distraught and i didn't want to make anything worse so i just kind of let it happen and gave up
2017-05-04 11:16:44	keveloper	she's p fucked up
2017-05-04 11:16:47	na_th_an	yeah
2017-05-04 11:16:51	na_th_an	that's pretty fucked up
2017-05-04 11:17:08	keveloper	idk i dont think its that big of a deal
2017-05-04 11:17:36	keveloper	when i think about shitty things she did to me that doesn't really come to the front of my mind
2017-05-04 12:18:20	keveloper	abby pms people from beyblades lol
2017-05-04 12:20:06	na_th_an	wat
2017-05-04 12:20:25	na_th_an	she's on a lot in the evenings now
2017-05-04 12:21:07	keveloper	shes in love
2017-05-04 12:33:09	na_th_an	do you think abby actually has OCD or if she's like "lol I have OCD" like a lot of people do
2017-05-04 12:34:24	keveloper	idk
2017-05-04 12:34:33	keveloper	seems like an attention thing with her honestly
2017-05-04 12:34:39	keveloper	she gets way too excited to talk about it
2017-05-04 12:34:44	na_th_an	yeah
2017-05-04 12:34:53	keveloper	if she actually had it i bet she wouldn't want to talk about it
2017-05-04 12:36:39	na_th_an	are you sure you updated the readmes
2017-05-04 12:36:48	keveloper	uh
2017-05-04 12:36:51	keveloper	i updated at least 4
2017-05-04 12:36:53	na_th_an	DS and DUI both weren't done
2017-05-04 12:36:56	keveloper	oh
2017-05-04 12:37:00	keveloper	i thought i did ds
2017-05-04 12:37:04	na_th_an	it's not there
2017-05-04 12:37:32	keveloper	i guess i didn't do DS or DUI
2017-05-04 14:25:21	na_th_an	just farted really loud
2017-05-04 14:25:23	na_th_an	whoops
2017-05-04 14:26:26	keveloper	hey
2017-05-04 14:26:27	keveloper	yt
2017-05-04 14:26:46	na_th_an	ya
2017-05-04 14:28:11	keveloper	remember when you did that seperator on the citations select thing
2017-05-04 14:28:16	keveloper	did you just use dashes to separate
2017-05-04 14:28:17	na_th_an	yea
2017-05-04 14:28:19	na_th_an	yea
2017-05-04 14:28:23	na_th_an	well
2017-05-04 14:28:33	na_th_an	there's a UTF character that can make it look like a solid line
2017-05-04 14:28:44	na_th_an	but it's still one character repeating that forms a line
2017-05-04 14:28:57	na_th_an	if the data in the select is static then it's not a proble
2017-05-04 14:29:25	na_th_an	but if it's dynamic then it can be an issue because the length of the UTF8 separators has to be equal to the length of the longest option
2017-05-04 14:29:36	na_th_an	and since it's not monospace it's not really something you can calculate
2017-05-04 14:30:07	keveloper	ok cool
2017-05-04 14:30:18	keveloper	k same
2017-05-04 16:18:10	keveloper	im so confused

2017-05-04 16:46:47	na_th_an	it took me like 2 hours to get the firmware working on my 60% and it was the first time I was doing it

2017-05-08 09:39:56	keveloper	then started the remix
2017-05-08 09:39:59	keveloper	still haven't heard the real song
2017-05-08 09:41:15	keveloper	oh i dont like this
2017-05-08 09:42:03	na_th_an	bridget was like "why did we even do snowflake if we have to do this every quarter" when bill mentioned that DEV/NIT have to be down for a day

2017-05-08 10:44:49	na_th_an	what did you think of that meeting
2017-05-08 10:44:57	keveloper	-_-
2017-05-08 10:45:02	keveloper	did you see me look at you a couple times
2017-05-08 10:45:05	na_th_an	yes
2017-05-08 10:45:15	na_th_an	I thought bryan did a pretty poor job of explaining things
2017-05-08 10:45:24	na_th_an	I wasn't sure if that was for developers or qa/product
2017-05-08 10:45:37	na_th_an	it hit a weird mix of both that I feel like just confused product and brett with technical terms
2017-05-08 10:46:08	na_th_an	half of the point of us changing was to get product and qa to test code where it's integrated with other features and I don't feel like their questions in that regard were addressed
2017-05-08 10:46:10	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-08 10:46:13	keveloper	yes
2017-05-08 10:46:26	na_th_an	and then rashmi would ask a question
2017-05-08 10:46:32	na_th_an	and dave answered osmething completely unrelated
2017-05-08 10:46:42	na_th_an	because he didn't understand the question
2017-05-08 10:46:45	keveloper	lol
2017-05-08 10:47:19	na_th_an	also "you always need a pull request"

2017-05-08 13:25:04	na_th_an	I don't think so?
2017-05-08 13:25:20	na_th_an	they said that it's capacity issues with not enough dedicated hosts and their virtual hosts are bad
2017-05-08 13:25:26	na_th_an	idk why their virtual hosts are so bad
2017-05-08 13:25:58	keveloper	they didn't scale with their playerbase
2017-05-08 13:27:39	keveloper	so
2017-05-08 13:27:50	keveloper	even though
2017-05-08 13:27:55	keveloper	dui starts and runs on 8090
2017-05-08 13:28:02	keveloper	it can't bind if i have ds running on 8080
2017-05-08 13:28:10	keveloper	so i have to start dui first
2017-05-08 13:28:21	keveloper	so it can pretend that it will start on 8080 then actually start on 8090
2017-05-08 13:28:25	keveloper	then i start ds on 8080
2017-05-08 13:28:35	keveloper	once dui has convinced itself to run on 8090
2017-05-08 13:28:45	keveloper	ok now i can't bind DS to 8080
2017-05-08 13:29:00	keveloper	there's nothing running on 8080
2017-05-08 13:29:07	keveloper	DS can't bind to 8080
2017-05-08 13:29:20	keveloper	WAIT
2017-05-08 13:29:29	keveloper	it might be the debug socket
2017-05-08 13:29:46	keveloper	it doesn't say
2017-05-08 13:30:53	keveloper	ok so you have to start DUI first, then connect the debugger
2017-05-08 13:30:54	keveloper	then start ds

2017-05-08 16:12:43	keveloper	if i search booklet or booklets it fails
2017-05-08 16:12:50	keveloper	has nothing to do with the fact that it has book in it
2017-05-08 16:12:53	keveloper	i tried bookl
2017-05-08 16:12:55	keveloper	and bookletz

2017-05-09 10:25:35	keveloper	its being mocked how it was written a year ago by ying
2017-05-09 10:25:38	keveloper	but it doesn't make sense
2017-05-09 10:25:50	keveloper	you can't see what the method returns if you mock it...
2017-05-09 10:26:02	keveloper	and this is supposed to test what the method returns..
2017-05-09 10:26:52	na_th_an	*shrug* idk
2017-05-09 10:30:52	keveloper	u get what i mean
2017-05-09 10:31:15	na_th_an	ya
2017-05-09 10:31:17	na_th_an	kinda
2017-05-09 10:31:19	na_th_an	idk
2017-05-09 10:31:23	na_th_an	got a lotta saved searches stuff to think about rn
2017-05-09 10:31:50	keveloper	https://pastebin.com/kSMaFs9Y
2017-05-09 10:31:52	keveloper	to test that method
2017-05-09 10:32:06	keveloper	you can't mock the messageSourceAccessor
2017-05-09 10:32:06	na_th_an	dude idk
2017-05-09 10:32:10	keveloper	fjiosadjfoidsjf
2017-05-09 10:32:10	keveloper	dsafiosdfjdsoioj
2017-05-09 10:32:17	keveloper	ok
2017-05-09 10:39:59	na_th_an	well I guess I'll go ask jimmy to look at stlack
2017-05-09 10:48:08	na_th_an	the user portal build is set up poorly and undocumented 
2017-05-09 10:50:32	keveloper	rip
2017-05-09 10:51:22	na_th_an	npm is trash
2017-05-09 10:51:24	na_th_an	fuck this
2017-05-09 10:54:51	keveloper	do crows really start brining you random gifts if you feed them continuously
2017-05-09 10:55:25	na_th_an	I don't think so idk
2017-05-09 10:56:25	keveloper	there's been multiple accounts of it apparently
2017-05-09 10:56:42	na_th_an	can't say I know much about crows
2017-05-09 10:56:57	keveloper	apparently they are really smart
2017-05-09 10:57:08	na_th_an	ya they are
2017-05-09 10:58:04	keveloper	oh wow
2017-05-09 10:58:20	keveloper	i m watching a video of one solving puzzles to get food from a little trough thing
2017-05-09 10:58:39	keveloper	WOW
2017-05-09 10:58:40	na_th_an	the water displacement one is awesome
2017-05-09 10:58:48	keveloper	omg
2017-05-09 10:59:11	keveloper	so he like managed to get a stick from this string thing
2017-05-09 10:59:39	keveloper	https://youtu.be/URZ_EciujrE?t=1m4s
2017-05-09 10:59:51	keveloper	but its too small to reach the food
2017-05-09 11:00:13	keveloper	so he uses it to get another longer stick from a cage thing
2017-05-09 11:00:25	keveloper	TIL crows are tool users
2017-05-09 11:03:24	keveloper	i always forget to return it and the end of a with blcook
2017-05-09 11:07:14	keveloper	match {} is super nice in gmock
2017-05-09 12:00:55	keveloper	i have \\s twice
2017-05-09 12:00:59	keveloper	and codenarc is like
2017-05-09 12:01:03	keveloper	DUPLICATE STRING!!#:DJH!11!!
2017-05-09 12:01:27	na_th_an	I liked how I had to supress a warning in a health check for catching Exception
2017-05-09 12:02:56	keveloper	omg
2017-05-09 12:02:57	keveloper	and join
2017-05-09 12:03:01	keveloper	i have join(' ')
2017-05-09 12:03:01	keveloper	twice
2017-05-09 12:03:03	keveloper	and codenarc
2017-05-09 12:03:04	keveloper	islike
2017-05-09 12:03:05	keveloper	nope
2017-05-09 12:03:06	na_th_an	rip
2017-05-09 12:03:11	keveloper	smfhsh
2017-05-09 12:03:15	keveloper	shake my fucking head so hard
2017-05-09 12:03:20	na_th_an	so much hate
2017-05-09 12:03:22	na_th_an	smh
2017-05-09 12:07:50	keveloper	uh no i have cyclomatic complexity issues
2017-05-09 12:07:57	na_th_an	rip
2017-05-09 12:09:26	keveloper	i dont get where this value comes from
2017-05-09 12:09:27	keveloper	its 5
2017-05-09 12:09:40	na_th_an	the cyclomatic complexity?
2017-05-09 12:09:43	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-09 12:09:50	keveloper	like how is the value caluclated
2017-05-09 12:09:51	na_th_an	completely arbitrary but it doesn't matter what the number is - JB
2017-05-09 12:10:01	keveloper	lol
2017-05-09 12:10:10	keveloper	i have a for loop and a find
2017-05-09 12:10:16	keveloper	thats not that bad
2017-05-09 12:10:27	keveloper	but its apparently 5
2017-05-09 12:10:30	na_th_an	rip
2017-05-09 12:11:17	keveloper	so i have
2017-05-09 12:11:23	keveloper	for { e.find {}}
2017-05-09 12:11:28	keveloper	and collect { e.find {}}
2017-05-09 12:11:32	keveloper	and those are both 5?
2017-05-09 12:11:33	keveloper	idk
2017-05-09 12:11:36	na_th_an	idk man
2017-05-09 12:11:43	keveloper	like i can't write it any better than that
2017-05-09 12:12:00	keveloper	i have to loop through the suggestions and then loop through the query words
2017-05-09 12:12:00	keveloper	so
2017-05-09 12:12:02	keveloper	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-05-09 12:12:07	na_th_an	is it method cyclomatic
2017-05-09 12:12:09	na_th_an	or what
2017-05-09 12:12:14	na_th_an	if it's the method just break it up
2017-05-09 12:12:22	na_th_an	you can even assign closures to variables
2017-05-09 12:12:24	keveloper	The cyclomatic complexity for method [generateSuggestionMarkup] is [5]
2017-05-09 12:12:26	na_th_an	and then call the closure
2017-05-09 12:12:43	keveloper	what is the type of a closure
2017-05-09 12:12:47	na_th_an	Closure
2017-05-09 12:13:16	na_th_an	http://git.ent.oclc.org/projects/DISC/repos/discoveryui/pull-requests/440/diff#discoveryui-health/src/test/groovy/org/oclc/discoveryui/health/DiscoverySavedSearchHealthCheckTest.groovy
2017-05-09 12:13:18	na_th_an	I do it here
2017-05-09 12:13:29	keveloper	yeah i got it
2017-05-09 12:13:30	keveloper	thats cool
2017-05-09 12:13:35	na_th_an	ya
2017-05-09 12:16:09	keveloper	hmm i need to pass a value to this closure
2017-05-09 12:16:19	na_th_an	you can do that
2017-05-09 12:16:28	na_th_an	.call(foo)
2017-05-09 12:16:34	na_th_an	.call(foo, bar)
2017-05-09 12:16:43	na_th_an	{ foo, bar -> blah }
2017-05-09 12:16:53	keveloper	Closure matchingSource = { int i -> it.source == (queryWords[i] - STARTING_INDEX_REGEX) }
2017-05-09 12:16:59	keveloper	boolean suggestion = spellingSuggestionList.find matchingSource.call(i)?.suggestion
2017-05-09 12:17:17	na_th_an	that reads better imo
2017-05-09 12:17:25	keveloper	what reads better
2017-05-09 12:17:28	na_th_an	that
2017-05-09 12:17:29	keveloper	the find matching source part?
2017-05-09 12:17:31	na_th_an	I like that
2017-05-09 12:17:32	keveloper	yeah its pretty interesting
2017-05-09 12:17:33	na_th_an	ya
2017-05-09 12:17:43	keveloper	spellingSuggestionList find matching source is really intuitive
2017-05-09 12:18:00	na_th_an	self documenting code and whatnot
2017-05-09 12:19:20	keveloper	hmmmm
2017-05-09 12:19:23	keveloper	idk if this is gonna work with find
2017-05-09 12:19:35	keveloper	like will it pass it to it automatically
2017-05-09 12:19:45	na_th_an	wut
2017-05-09 12:19:57	keveloper	idk intelliJ isn't like it
2017-05-09 12:21:54	keveloper	ooh simplified more
2017-05-09 12:21:55	keveloper	            Closure matchingSource = { it.source == (queryWords[i] - STARTING_INDEX_REGEX) }
2017-05-09 12:21:55	keveloper	            boolean suggestion = spellingSuggestionList.find matchingSourec
2017-05-09 12:21:57	keveloper	that works
2017-05-09 12:22:08	na_th_an	oh wow that's awesmoe
2017-05-09 12:22:12	na_th_an	wouldn't have eixpected that
2017-05-09 12:22:26	keveloper	that '-' subtracts an index from the word
2017-05-09 12:22:37	na_th_an	dope
2017-05-09 12:22:39	keveloper	any index if there is one at the beginning
2017-05-09 12:22:40	keveloper	so coool
2017-05-09 12:22:46	keveloper	plz codenarc
2017-05-09 12:23:10	keveloper	consecutive blank lines
2017-05-09 12:23:11	keveloper	OK
2017-05-09 12:23:49	keveloper	i have no idea why the cyclomatic complexity of this method is high
2017-05-09 12:23:55	keveloper	uhh
2017-05-09 12:24:21	na_th_an	rip
2017-05-09 12:25:45	keveloper	https://cryptobin.co/f3l48117
2017-05-09 12:25:49	keveloper	password oclc
2017-05-09 12:26:47	na_th_an	idk man
2017-05-09 12:26:52	keveloper	like thats fine
2017-05-09 12:26:59	na_th_an	idk
2017-05-09 12:26:59	keveloper	i guess i could move the logger stuff
2017-05-09 12:27:05	na_th_an	show rich and he'll be like "yeah codenarc sucks"
2017-05-09 12:27:09	keveloper	lol
2017-05-09 12:27:12	na_th_an	show zach and he'll be like "yeah codenarc sucks"
2017-05-09 12:27:23	na_th_an	show bryan and he'll be like "yeah codenarc isn't great"
2017-05-09 12:27:27	na_th_an	and we'll do nothing about it
2017-05-09 12:42:06	keveloper	ugh
2017-05-09 12:42:10	keveloper	time to test some optionals
2017-05-09 12:48:22	keveloper	bleb bleb

2017-05-09 13:13:39	na_th_an	declined
2017-05-09 13:14:06	keveloper	is that in code or commit

2017-05-09 13:14:25	keveloper	i dont see that
2017-05-09 13:14:44	keveloper	my title is Ticket/enitre query suggestion/DA-23423
2017-05-09 13:15:24	na_th_an	savage
2017-05-09 13:16:23	na_th_an	this user portal build is awful
2017-05-09 13:16:28	keveloper	:(
2017-05-09 13:16:33	na_th_an	I thought it was good because it's from last summer and it's spring boot
2017-05-09 13:16:38	na_th_an	I've been told it was good
2017-05-09 13:16:40	na_th_an	parts of it are
2017-05-09 13:16:44	na_th_an	but holy shit this build is poorly put together
2017-05-09 13:16:56	na_th_an	it's been building for like 15 minutes and I have no idea why it's taking so long
2017-05-09 13:18:21	na_th_an	holy shit there are literally 4 conversations happening within earshot of me right now
2017-05-09 13:18:38	keveloper	earshot
2017-05-09 13:18:48	na_th_an	what about it
2017-05-09 13:19:03	na_th_an	jim shut the fuck up
2017-05-09 13:19:10	na_th_an	the mic is one inch from your mouth
2017-05-09 13:21:25	keveloper	loooool
2017-05-09 13:21:39	keveloper	i just wanna go work on remix
2017-05-09 13:22:08	keveloper	i need to redo the chorus
2017-05-09 13:22:14	keveloper	the vocal fills r bad
2017-05-09 13:22:22	keveloper	also the piano layer needs out of there
2017-05-09 13:22:36	keveloper	im so hap tho it sounds like
2017-05-09 13:22:37	keveloper	professional
2017-05-09 13:22:42	na_th_an	-_- these tests work when I run them from intellij but the build is getting stuck so I can't even get the report
2017-05-09 13:22:43	keveloper	i haven't made something that sounds this good in a while
2017-05-09 13:22:48	keveloper	weird
2017-05-09 13:25:01	keveloper	i also have these dope tom fills but i can't get them to pop out the mix idk why its annoying
2017-05-09 13:25:34	keveloper	mixing is hard :(
2017-05-09 13:26:14	keveloper	i have to have a solution review
2017-05-09 13:26:21	keveloper	what do i do for this
2017-05-09 13:26:28	keveloper	invite product/qa/ux/tech lledas?
2017-05-09 13:26:39	na_th_an	ya I think
2017-05-09 13:26:44	keveloper	we already spent all the time grooming and stuff why do we have to review it again
2017-05-09 13:27:09	na_th_an	because product doesn't want to do their job and break shit into stories so you have to
2017-05-09 13:27:20	na_th_an	then you have to go and say "here I did your job, did I do it well enough?"
2017-05-09 13:27:42	keveloper	are managers supposed to do this
2017-05-09 13:27:44	keveloper	come
2017-05-09 13:27:46	keveloper	i dont want them to

2017-05-09 13:38:39	na_th_an	I never thought I'd do LD relationships
2017-05-09 13:38:43	na_th_an	but he's special <3 <3 <3
2017-05-09 13:39:19	keveloper	v speical

2017-05-09 13:41:09	keveloper	we were friends from like sophomore year of highscool to junior year of college
2017-05-09 13:41:23	keveloper	she's the only long distance person i would consider was actually a friend at some point
2017-05-09 13:41:27	keveloper	not anymore we dont really talk
2017-05-09 13:41:31	keveloper	im assuming we're never gonna talk again
2017-05-09 13:41:49	keveloper	i unfriended her on fb a month ago or so when i was pruning friends
2017-05-09 13:41:50	na_th_an	I have LD friends from coding
2017-05-09 13:41:55	keveloper	fb fetch --prunce
2017-05-09 13:41:56	na_th_an	aww rip :(
2017-05-09 13:41:59	keveloper	¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Please review the email I sent - you were the SME on this and I was looking for you to step up and get this resolved for me. You need to recognize these “opportunities” to assist, particularly your boss. If you have any questions please set a meeting sometime next week since I’m out of time this week. Thanks

2017-05-10 14:57:33	na_th_an	passes it around a bit
2017-05-10 14:57:41	na_th_an	then splits it back into an array by splitting on ~|~
2017-05-10 14:57:46	na_th_an	why not just use a fucking array
2017-05-10 14:57:50	na_th_an	this code is confusing as fuck

2017-05-10 15:07:35	na_th_an	i like long methods
2017-05-10 15:07:40	na_th_an	without descriptive names
2017-05-10 15:07:41	keveloper	lol
2017-05-10 15:07:59	na_th_an	I really wanted to comment on this js when he made the pr but I really didn't know how
2017-05-10 15:08:11	na_th_an	"This javascript seems terrible, can you make it better?"
2017-05-10 15:08:12	keveloper	yeah not much you can do
2017-05-10 15:08:21	keveloper	"rewrite this, hard to understand"
2017-05-10 15:08:28	na_th_an	it seemed like a tech lead's job
2017-05-10 15:08:32	keveloper	"have all jquery selectors in one place"
2017-05-10 15:08:33	keveloper	yeah but
2017-05-10 15:08:36	keveloper	if they had no comments then
2017-05-10 15:08:37	keveloper	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-05-10 15:08:43	keveloper	non-profit
2017-05-10 15:08:48	keveloper	less than avg pay w/e
2017-05-10 15:08:55	na_th_an	rockstars tho
2017-05-10 15:08:56	keveloper	less than avg pay == less than avg code
2017-05-10 15:09:00	keveloper	jus sayin
2017-05-10 15:09:02	na_th_an	yeah
2017-05-10 15:09:05	na_th_an	totally
2017-05-10 15:09:13	keveloper	like there are exceptions
2017-05-10 15:09:14	keveloper	but
2017-05-10 15:09:18	keveloper	when youre talkinga bout averages
2017-05-10 15:09:26	keveloper	if you pay less than average your product will be less than average
2017-05-10 15:09:35	na_th_an	it's like the construction
2017-05-10 15:09:38	keveloper	yes
2017-05-10 15:09:40	na_th_an	when you go with the minimum bidder
2017-05-10 15:09:52	keveloper	i thought charles wrote good code :(
2017-05-10 15:10:07	na_th_an	he usually does
2017-05-10 15:11:14	keveloper	hmm
2017-05-10 15:11:28	keveloper	that dumb method that generates markup
2017-05-10 15:11:34	keveloper	i wanted to make it NOT do that
2017-05-10 15:11:36	keveloper	and use tags
2017-05-10 15:11:40	keveloper	but zach was like no dont do that
2017-05-10 15:11:44	keveloper	and i was like ok w/e ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-05-10 15:52:30	keveloper	"Can you try it now?"
2017-05-10 15:52:36	keveloper	not an acceptable response
2017-05-10 15:52:40	keveloper	the only acceptable response is
2017-05-10 15:52:42	keveloper	"This is fixed"
2017-05-10 15:52:52	keveloper	like did he not try it
2017-05-10 15:53:19	keveloper	like its clearly not there when i got dev service config
2017-05-10 15:53:37	keveloper	 garbble garbble
2017-05-10 15:55:06	na_th_an	can we have smaller teams plz
2017-05-10 15:55:40	keveloper	you see goth alice being a dick to kerrang lol
2017-05-10 15:55:46	keveloper	i dont think she's trying to be but
2017-05-10 16:00:38	na_th_an	"Stop, kerrang, breath, and really think about it for a moment"
2017-05-10 16:00:43	keveloper	lol
2017-05-10 16:00:44	keveloper	like
2017-05-10 16:00:44	keveloper	wat
2017-05-10 16:00:48	na_th_an	does she realize how incredibly condecending that is
2017-05-10 16:00:52	keveloper	he stopped replying
2017-05-10 16:00:54	keveloper	probably not idk
2017-05-10 16:01:43	keveloper	i am confused about what he means by 'getting it working'
2017-05-10 16:01:47	keveloper	like it just happens
2017-05-10 16:01:52	na_th_an	idk
2017-05-10 16:01:56	keveloper	if the browser finds that the font is on the system
2017-05-10 16:05:13	na_th_an	i'm still trying to figure out wtf is happening with this js
2017-05-10 16:15:10	keveloper	balc was nice
2017-05-10 16:22:21	keveloper	"There was some “cleverness” employed on these applications/pieces.  I started doing the copy for DeliveryResolver-elink and found that “ansibleGroupName” was overridden in a nonstandard way."
2017-05-10 16:22:24	keveloper	mike called me clever
2017-05-10 16:22:55	na_th_an	"cleverness" is that which is born when we don't know what we're doing and have to make it work anyway
2017-05-10 16:23:02	keveloper	uh
2017-05-10 16:23:04	keveloper	ok
2017-05-10 16:23:09	na_th_an	it is
2017-05-10 16:23:14	keveloper	i knew what i was doing tho
2017-05-10 17:22:52	keveloper	i dont  think mdc1 is in most installscripts yet :o
2017-05-10 18:58:22	na_th_an	no it's not
2017-05-10 18:58:29	na_th_an	why would it be
2017-05-10 18:58:31	na_th_an	we didn' do it
2017-05-11 08:55:24	keveloper	have you seen sausage party
2017-05-11 08:55:29	na_th_an	no
2017-05-11 08:55:39	keveloper	do you care if i tell you
2017-05-11 08:55:44	keveloper	its not really a spoiler
2017-05-11 08:55:47	na_th_an	no
2017-05-11 08:55:59	keveloper	the whole thing is basically about questioning your beliefs
2017-05-11 08:56:13	na_th_an	i thought it was about penis
2017-05-11 08:56:16	keveloper	and finding evidence for actual facts
2017-05-11 08:56:29	keveloper	no all of the food follows religions
2017-05-11 08:56:36	keveloper	about what happens when they leave the grocery store
2017-05-11 08:56:40	na_th_an	idk anything about it
2017-05-11 08:57:06	keveloper	and they all think the "gods" aka humans worship them and treat them well in the "Great Beyond" aka heaven
2017-05-11 08:57:07	keveloper	lol
2017-05-11 08:57:19	keveloper	and the "non-perishables" made up that story
2017-05-11 08:57:23	keveloper	because the truth was depressing
2017-05-11 08:57:28	keveloper	and they wanted the food to be happy
2017-05-11 08:57:42	na_th_an	sounds like a story someone would write while really high
2017-05-11 08:57:45	keveloper	lol
2017-05-11 08:57:52	keveloper	well seth rogen wrote it so
2017-05-11 08:58:09	keveloper	anyway it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be
2017-05-11 08:58:19	keveloper	a lot of 'challenge your religious beliefs' stuff in it
2017-05-11 09:00:16	keveloper	oh yeah and the main guy (seth rogen) finds proof of the truth and shows it to all the food and they choose to believe the happier one
2017-05-11 09:00:29	na_th_an	3deep5me
2017-05-11 09:00:54	keveloper	also 
2017-05-11 09:01:01	keveloper	the humans cant understand or see the food
2017-05-11 09:01:04	keveloper	talking and moving around and stuff
2017-05-11 09:01:09	na_th_an	so toy story with food
2017-05-11 09:01:25	keveloper	but they find out that if the humans are on bath salts they can
2017-05-11 09:01:36	keveloper	so the food uses that to their advantage to kill a bunch of people
2017-05-11 09:01:40	na_th_an	the more you talk about this the worse it sounds
2017-05-11 09:01:42	keveloper	also toy story is different
2017-05-11 09:01:57	keveloper	i didn't say it was good i said it was better than i thought lol
2017-05-11 09:02:10	keveloper	but the toys in toy story stop moving when humans are around
2017-05-11 09:05:51	na_th_an	it's crazy to me how some people have spent so long on these applications but know almost nothing about it
2017-05-11 09:06:09	na_th_an	jimmy was around for all of user portal's development but didn't even know it used a cdn
2017-05-11 09:06:10	keveloper	ya
2017-05-11 09:06:14	keveloper	what makes you think of that
2017-05-11 09:06:24	na_th_an	we have people that worked on owc for all or nearly all of its life
2017-05-11 09:06:35	na_th_an	but it's just totally impossible to run it on our macs
2017-05-11 09:06:35	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-11 09:06:39	keveloper	idk man
2017-05-11 09:07:08	keveloper	idp week i'll get owc running locally and in git and ubiquitized
2017-05-11 09:07:10	keveloper	using gradle 
2017-05-11 09:07:12	keveloper	1 week
2017-05-11 09:07:45	keveloper	im just gonna convert it to git and go ham
2017-05-11 09:08:06	na_th_an	i want to get dui to have es6
2017-05-11 09:08:12	na_th_an	and get rid of gulp
2017-05-11 09:08:15	keveloper	doit
2017-05-11 09:08:16	na_th_an	and use webpack
2017-05-11 09:08:36	keveloper	vanilla js the entire thing lol
2017-05-11 09:08:38	keveloper	get rid of jquery
2017-05-11 09:08:44	na_th_an	lol no
2017-05-11 09:08:49	keveloper	that would take
2017-05-11 09:08:51	keveloper	agggeessss
2017-05-11 09:08:57	na_th_an	I'm not a vanilla js hipster
2017-05-11 09:13:25	keveloper	what if in a week we converted DUI to a front end/back end
2017-05-11 09:13:35	keveloper	what if we did just one page
2017-05-11 09:13:42	keveloper	as a poc
2017-05-11 09:13:57	na_th_an	then we'd end up with a page that nobody else knows how it's supposed to work
2017-05-11 09:14:04	na_th_an	and as soon as anyone did anything in it they'd fuck it up
2017-05-11 09:14:09	na_th_an	and do something really dumb
2017-05-11 09:14:09	keveloper	we would fork obviously jeez

2017-05-11 09:59:51	keveloper	:(
2017-05-11 10:00:03	na_th_an	this is honestly some of the worst js I've had to deal with on this team
2017-05-11 10:00:35	na_th_an	                        (this.indexOf('::') > -1) ? secondaryFacetInputValues.push(this) : primaryFacetInputValues.push(this);
2017-05-11 10:00:42	na_th_an	like you could at least put a comment saying wtf this is
2017-05-11 10:00:46	na_th_an	where did '::' come from 
2017-05-11 10:00:48	na_th_an	like seriously

2017-05-11 10:02:00	na_th_an	oh obviously this method took a string list separated by ~|~ instead of an array

2017-05-11 10:04:34	keveloper	http://disccfgap01dxm1.dev.oclc.org:8080/discoveryconfig/health
2017-05-11 10:04:36	keveloper	i dont believe

2017-05-11 10:07:27	keveloper	i love that the best way to store that is a string
2017-05-11 10:07:35	na_th_an	yeah when I think key value pairs
2017-05-11 10:07:37	na_th_an	I think strings
2017-05-11 10:07:52	na_th_an	does he not know that you can do maps and lists in js
2017-05-11 10:07:52	keveloper	god fcking dammit no rip me
2017-05-11 10:07:55	na_th_an	i just don't fucking understand
2017-05-11 10:08:42	keveloper	bitbucket plz respond
2017-05-11 10:08:47	keveloper	so hard to be productive
2017-05-11 10:10:27	na_th_an	it's so hard to not just want to rip all this code out
2017-05-11 10:11:54	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-11 10:12:01	keveloper	i almost did that to the YUI stuff
2017-05-11 10:12:03	keveloper	but its used so
2017-05-11 10:17:08	na_th_an	I think I fixed the bug on the DUI side at least
2017-05-11 10:17:16	na_th_an	I literally just had to add "name-" to a string
2017-05-11 10:17:24	na_th_an	because it was "database-value" instead of "database-name-value"
2017-05-11 10:17:31	na_th_an	but it took me about 4 hours to debug this code
2017-05-11 10:17:35	keveloper	-_-
2017-05-11 10:33:12	na_th_an	>_> I have to do a 360 degree feedback for mark

2017-05-11 10:34:56	keveloper	i have to do one for you
2017-05-11 10:34:59	na_th_an	idk
2017-05-11 10:35:04	na_th_an	email probably
2017-05-11 11:06:35	na_th_an	I'm not big on the whole "x number of indentation is too many" thing
2017-05-11 11:06:38	na_th_an	there are a lot of exceptions
2017-05-11 11:06:51	na_th_an	but 5 levels with 3 embedded closures is a bit much
2017-05-11 11:08:02	keveloper	lol
2017-05-11 11:12:41	keveloper	jimmy giving another crack at it
2017-05-11 11:12:46	keveloper	'can you try it now?' -_-
2017-05-11 11:12:48	keveloper	YOU GO TRY IT NOW
2017-05-11 11:12:49	keveloper	jfc
2017-05-11 11:13:15	na_th_an	maybe he doesn't have credentials
2017-05-11 11:13:24	na_th_an	and doesn't realize he can get them or osmething
2017-05-11 11:13:32	keveloper	ugh
2017-05-11 11:18:26	keveloper	hey
2017-05-11 11:18:30	keveloper	what do you know about reactor
2017-05-11 11:18:34	na_th_an	nothing
2017-05-11 11:18:34	keveloper	and reactive programming
2017-05-11 11:18:37	na_th_an	well
2017-05-11 11:18:47	na_th_an	I know that spring 5 was build with something or other reactor in mind
2017-05-11 11:18:51	na_th_an	and that's all
2017-05-11 11:18:54	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-11 11:19:02	keveloper	do you what reactive programming is
2017-05-11 11:19:05	keveloper	or what reactive streams are
2017-05-11 11:19:08	na_th_an	no
2017-05-11 11:19:10	keveloper	same
2017-05-11 11:19:16	na_th_an	i might have read about them before but I don't remember
2017-05-11 11:19:39	keveloper	spring 5 is apparently like built on this idk http://projectreactor.io/
2017-05-11 11:20:00	keveloper	In a nutshell reactive programming is about non-blocking, event-driven applications that scale with a small number of threads with backpressure as a key ingredient that aims to ensure producers do not overwhelm consumers.

2017-05-17 12:22:54	keveloper	i've never done anything like this in my life so im thinking why not yanno
2017-05-17 12:23:31	keveloper	ok so what exactly did you do?
2017-05-17 12:23:37	na_th_an	"are stephen and abby dating yet" lololololo

2017-05-17 12:24:03	na_th_an	like i said tho it takes awhile for coinbase to send you the coins
2017-05-17 12:24:07	na_th_an	which is why I owe arij $500
2017-05-17 12:24:21	keveloper	ok

2017-05-17 12:27:22	keveloper	where does digibyte come into play
2017-05-17 12:27:31	keveloper	its a blockchain
2017-05-17 12:27:51	na_th_an	you should probably go read about altcoins and cryptocurrencies
2017-05-17 12:29:18	keveloper	so altcoins are just alternative cryptocurrencies that arent bitcoin ya
2017-05-17 12:29:24	keveloper	i figured that much already
2017-05-17 12:30:14	na_th_an	ya
2017-05-17 12:30:43	keveloper	so you bought both bitcoin and an altcoin?

2017-05-17 14:28:08	keveloper	what is it
2017-05-17 14:28:16	na_th_an	some sybase connections are failing in dev
2017-05-17 14:28:21	na_th_an	and cluttering their logs
2017-05-17 14:28:56	keveloper	oh wow
2017-05-17 14:33:31	na_th_an	nothing like being handed a 3 week old problem by a senior dev and being told "I have no idea" when you ask what they found out
2017-05-17 14:34:11	keveloper	ikr
2017-05-17 14:34:37	keveloper	idk who to get 360 reviews from

2017-05-17 14:36:02	keveloper	i always ask him dumb questions
2017-05-17 14:38:05	na_th_an	what makes me especially ticked off about this triage issue is that bill asked harika to open a jira if it was needed for tracking
2017-05-17 14:38:18	na_th_an	then the issue was forgotten about for 2 weeks and nothing was done
2017-05-17 14:38:23	na_th_an	she never opened a jira or documented anything she found
2017-05-17 14:38:38	na_th_an	but we're gonna get the same "self actualization" talk from rashmi on thursday
2017-05-17 14:39:00	na_th_an	and then I'm gonna have my one on one where she asks me how I think we can change our team to a high functioning product development shop
2017-05-17 14:39:10	na_th_an	and help our team become self actualizing
2017-05-17 14:39:25	keveloper	-_-
2017-05-17 14:39:44	na_th_an	I write fucking paragraphs in my triage tickets and document everything I find
2017-05-17 14:40:02	na_th_an	I documented everything I did in confluence the last time I was on triage
2017-05-17 14:40:04	na_th_an	literally everything
2017-05-17 14:40:17	keveloper	grade 17 fo ru
2017-05-17 14:40:28	na_th_an	zach updated it a few times when he was on triage the week after me
2017-05-17 14:40:32	na_th_an	and it hasn't been updated since
2017-05-17 14:40:34	keveloper	u only have 1 year post college xperience na_th_an u r junior dev
2017-05-17 14:40:44	keveloper	nothing happened when i was on triage so
2017-05-17 15:21:19	na_th_an	charles destroyed all logging in DR when he did the logging improvements stuff
2017-05-17 15:21:34	na_th_an	it's not logging anything for this request :(
2017-05-17 15:21:58	keveloper	really
2017-05-17 15:22:01	keveloper	i figured that would happen
2017-05-17 15:22:03	keveloper	not surprised
2017-05-17 15:22:14	na_th_an	yup
2017-05-17 15:22:21	na_th_an	I have no idea how to debug this
2017-05-17 15:22:24	keveloper	-_-
2017-05-17 15:22:24	na_th_an	because it isn't logging anything
2017-05-17 15:22:33	keveloper	that whole minimize logging thing was risky af
2017-05-17 15:22:45	na_th_an	it made rashmi really happy
2017-05-17 15:22:51	keveloper	well
2017-05-17 15:22:51	na_th_an	we definitely need to improve our logs but
2017-05-17 15:23:07	keveloper	i think charles was a little inexperience in DR to do that...
2017-05-17 15:23:12	na_th_an	yeah
2017-05-17 15:23:13	na_th_an	that too

2017-05-18 08:46:06	keveloper	then try to send money to it

2017-05-18 08:46:18	na_th_an	I can't help you if all you say is "it doesn't work"
2017-05-18 08:46:33	na_th_an	I probably can't help you anyway but
2017-05-18 08:46:54	keveloper	did you go to the coin base UI and send funds using the Send/Request feature
2017-05-18 08:47:00	na_th_an	yes
2017-05-18 08:47:03	keveloper	and paste in an ID that poloniex gavee you
2017-05-18 08:47:06	na_th_an	yes
2017-05-18 08:47:24	keveloper	yeah everytime i try that it says "Please enter a valid wallet address" or whatever

2017-05-18 08:48:04	keveloper	ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
2017-05-18 08:48:10	keveloper	looooooooooooooool
2017-05-18 08:48:20	na_th_an	so you could have easily just sent all of your money to someone else's wallet and lost it all
2017-05-18 08:48:41	keveloper	well coinbase didn't let me send it so
2017-05-18 08:49:01	keveloper	how much did you leave in coinbase
2017-05-18 08:49:30	na_th_an	I don't think any
2017-05-18 09:04:11	keveloper	i think its just how bill talks
2017-05-18 09:04:16	keveloper	like how he structures sentences
2017-05-18 09:04:18	keveloper	and the words he says
2017-05-18 09:04:20	keveloper	i cant stand it
2017-05-18 09:05:52	na_th_an	would you rather rashmi be your manager
2017-05-18 09:13:00	keveloper	so abby went to all of our grooming and never estimated testing lol
2017-05-18 09:13:06	keveloper	matt is confused
2017-05-18 09:13:31	keveloper	also that separate spreadsheet that rashmi made for what was in the june release was missing a bunch of stuff
2017-05-18 09:13:33	keveloper	and matt is stressin
2017-05-18 09:13:53	na_th_an	it's almost like we should just use jira
2017-05-18 09:13:59	na_th_an	instead of trying to put everything into excel also
2017-05-18 09:14:06	keveloper	ya what a dumb idea

2017-05-18 09:14:56	na_th_an	it's a tool that could give us a lot more value than it is
2017-05-18 09:15:53	keveloper	¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2017-05-18 09:55:17	keveloper	-_-
2017-05-18 09:55:18	keveloper	Thought of a clean and very smart way to write stateful javascript modules in the confinements of DUI's frontend, e.g. using jQuery, require. Shared this with other devs. I've now written 2 JS modules this way in Discovery. They are very easy to read and change.
2017-05-18 09:55:28	na_th_an	dank

2017-05-19 09:52:08	keveloper	you see that rly funny prank
2017-05-19 15:15:24	na_th_an	-_-
2017-05-19 15:16:42	na_th_an	apparently kat is getting a windows machine because when you try to install 1.8.0_05 it tells you that the version isn't compatible with osx
2017-05-19 15:16:47	na_th_an	I told her I know a workaround for this
2017-05-19 15:16:51	na_th_an	and can help her
2017-05-19 15:17:01	keveloper	we dont even need to use that version anymore
2017-05-19 15:17:02	keveloper	remember
2017-05-19 15:17:03	na_th_an	but instead of asking for help she apparently has put in a request for a windows machine
2017-05-19 15:17:06	keveloper	that was because of dui
2017-05-19 15:17:07	na_th_an	we do in prod tho
2017-05-19 15:17:15	na_th_an	and I said
2017-05-19 15:17:16	keveloper	oh i guess
2017-05-19 15:17:17	keveloper	wait so
2017-05-19 15:17:23	keveloper	she did that herself?
2017-05-19 15:17:26	keveloper	without asking anybody?
2017-05-19 15:17:26	na_th_an	"you should talk to a tech lead or someone because it'll actually run with the newest version now"
2017-05-19 15:17:27	keveloper	like
2017-05-19 15:17:29	na_th_an	and she apparently did
2017-05-19 15:17:31	na_th_an	did not*
2017-05-19 15:17:32	keveloper	"hey how do you all have macs"
2017-05-19 15:17:47	na_th_an	I literally told her there was a workaround and I could help her
2017-05-19 15:17:53	na_th_an	I don't think she's very good with computers :/
2017-05-19 15:18:07	keveloper	can't we not run DUI on windows.
2017-05-19 15:18:09	na_th_an	she had to have me double click for her
2017-05-19 15:18:12	na_th_an	on her mac
2017-05-19 15:18:14	na_th_an	she couldn't get it
2017-05-19 15:18:18	keveloper	oh
2017-05-19 15:18:21	keveloper	-_-
2017-05-19 15:18:26	keveloper	masters in what
2017-05-19 15:22:00	na_th_an	applied computer science
2017-05-19 15:22:08	keveloper	what does that mean
2017-05-19 15:22:11	na_th_an	idk
2017-05-19 15:22:22	na_th_an	I was sitting down to do a technical interview and she was like "ok this is the time to install java"
2017-05-19 15:22:31	na_th_an	beacuse she couldn't find where to download 1.8.0_05
2017-05-19 15:22:35	na_th_an	so I gave her the link
2017-05-19 15:22:45	na_th_an	then she couldn't figure out how to install it
2017-05-19 15:22:52	na_th_an	because she'd "double click" and nothing happened
2017-05-19 15:22:59	keveloper	are we like training her or something
2017-05-19 15:23:03	na_th_an	I don't think she's going to be able to do anything useful for us 
2017-05-19 15:23:06	na_th_an	idk

2017-05-22 12:46:45	na_th_an	i don't understand how jb and jeff were so anal about design and the architecture for the backend
2017-05-22 12:46:51	keveloper	ya idk
2017-05-22 12:46:52	na_th_an	but then they just let the frontend go t oshit
2017-05-22 12:47:04	na_th_an	our js is so bad
2017-05-22 12:47:10	keveloper	yeah its p bad
2017-05-22 12:47:22	keveloper	idk
2017-05-22 12:47:26	keveloper	cause they dont know
2017-05-22 12:47:41	na_th_an	some basic design patterns or standards would be nice
2017-05-22 12:47:45	na_th_an	we don't even have fucking linting
2017-05-22 12:47:49	na_th_an	what year is this
2017-05-22 12:48:07	na_th_an	then there's our unit tests that use markup that we never update
2017-05-22 12:48:11	na_th_an	so those are useless
2017-05-22 12:48:52	keveloper	yeah

2017-05-22 12:49:47	keveloper	lol
2017-05-22 12:53:23	na_th_an	it's just basic things
2017-05-22 12:53:29	na_th_an	like this button is #create-personal-list
2017-05-22 12:53:40	na_th_an	but then all the js uses a class .personal-list-edit-list
2017-05-22 12:53:44	na_th_an	for no reason at all
2017-05-22 12:53:56	na_th_an	there's no other element with that class
2017-05-22 12:54:01	na_th_an	it exists for no reason at all
2017-05-22 12:54:05	na_th_an	and we just keep doing it the same way
2017-05-22 13:13:33	keveloper	because we havev bad front end devs
2017-05-22 13:53:01	keveloper	why cant we dbug soy
2017-05-22 13:53:04	keveloper	that would be so useful
2017-05-22 13:54:30	na_th_an	why can't we debug any templates at all
2017-05-22 13:54:35	na_th_an	we could if they were done on the client side
2017-05-22 13:54:50	keveloper	-_-
2017-05-22 14:13:59	na_th_an	this personal list stuff front end stuff is terrible
2017-05-22 14:14:05	keveloper	:(
2017-05-22 14:14:13	keveloper	yeah i don think ying is very good at front end
2017-05-22 14:14:31	na_th_an	she's good in that she can get something done
2017-05-22 14:14:37	keveloper	ya
2017-05-22 14:14:37	na_th_an	but not in that someone else can read it
2017-05-22 14:14:39	na_th_an	and modify it 
2017-05-22 14:14:45	na_th_an	#dr
2017-05-22 14:17:56	na_th_an	there's list-operations.soy list-actions.soy and show-created-private-list-page.soy
2017-05-22 14:18:02	na_th_an	all of them have the same button repeated in them
2017-05-22 14:18:10	na_th_an	and each instance of that button uses the same js
2017-05-22 14:18:21	na_th_an	to do different things
2017-05-22 14:18:29	na_th_an	on different pages
2017-05-22 14:18:30	keveloper	-_-
2017-05-22 14:19:05	na_th_an	ya let's just use the same code for creating and editing a personal list
2017-05-22 14:19:08	na_th_an	that sounds like a good idea
2017-05-22 14:19:12	na_th_an	okay </complain>
2017-05-22 14:20:04	na_th_an	I'm not looking forward to my 360 review for jimmy because i don't know what i can say that he does really well
2017-05-22 14:20:10	na_th_an	aside from answer questions when i go ask him things
2017-05-22 14:28:17	keveloper	in grooming the other day
2017-05-22 14:28:31	keveloper	yeah im putting one off for bryan because i have to think of compliments
2017-05-22 14:28:39	keveloper	good at leading the team i guess idk
2017-05-22 14:28:59	keveloper	abby was all snarky at me in grooming the other day
2017-05-22 14:29:16	keveloper	because i was making sure she knows how to go into firefly and find the wclconfig record to find an instutition that doesn't have a certain value set
2017-05-22 14:29:23	keveloper	and she was all snarky like "yes i know how"
2017-05-22 14:29:32	keveloper	i didn't even get to tell her the name of the field lol
2017-05-22 14:29:53	na_th_an	>_>
2017-05-22 14:29:58	na_th_an	ya bc firefly so ez
2017-05-22 14:31:02	keveloper	i can't find an inst that doesn't have it set so
2017-05-22 14:31:20	keveloper	and the field is at the very bottom of the record
2017-05-22 14:31:21	keveloper	so
2017-05-22 14:31:24	keveloper	i'm sure she'll find it
2017-05-22 14:31:45	keveloper	it's at the bottom of the record right below her massive amounts of pride
2017-05-22 14:32:17	na_th_an	W O W
2017-05-22 14:32:29	keveloper	lol

2017-05-22 14:32:42	na_th_an	like why doesn't she want to be a dev
2017-05-22 14:32:44	na_th_an	pride
2017-05-22 14:32:48	na_th_an	she might fale
2017-05-22 14:32:50	na_th_an	fail
2017-05-22 14:32:53	keveloper	i think thats it
2017-05-22 14:32:57	keveloper	we were talking to joe

2017-05-22 14:33:02	keveloper	joe ricci
2017-05-22 14:33:03	keveloper	and he was like
2017-05-22 14:33:05	na_th_an	ya
2017-05-22 14:33:08	keveloper	"when are you running off to dev land"
2017-05-22 14:33:16	keveloper	and she was like "i wanna be a amnager dude"
2017-05-22 14:33:21	keveloper	and he was like "what!? since when?"
2017-05-22 14:33:26	na_th_an	why the fuck would you want to be a manager
2017-05-22 14:33:30	na_th_an	i don't even get that
2017-05-22 14:33:33	keveloper	and she was like "i've always wanted to be a manager" and kinda nervous laughed
2017-05-22 14:33:33	keveloper	idk
2017-05-22 14:33:38	keveloper	because she's afraid to be a dev
2017-05-22 14:33:54	keveloper	probably because there are decent people who me and you dont love working with because they are incompetent and annoying
2017-05-22 14:33:59	keveloper	and she would be incompetent 
2017-05-22 14:34:04	keveloper	esp. after not coding for so long
2017-05-22 14:34:12	keveloper	i don't think she knows much about web dev
2017-05-22 14:34:13	keveloper	idk tho
2017-05-22 14:34:17	keveloper	she seems like she'd be decent
2017-05-22 14:34:18	na_th_an	well now she doesn't
2017-05-22 14:34:20	keveloper	she wants to make money
2017-05-22 14:34:23	na_th_an	i'm sure she's forgotten a ton
2017-05-22 14:34:27	keveloper	like managers dont make that much money abby
2017-05-22 14:34:28	na_th_an	i would have

2017-05-22 14:34:43	keveloper	i doubt bill makes that much more if at all than jimmy
2017-05-22 14:34:56	keveloper	imo managers should be paid less but
2017-05-22 14:35:00	keveloper	w/e

2017-05-22 15:53:02	keveloper	and when he said meteor doesn't support this
2017-05-22 15:53:07	keveloper	they were like "upgrade your shit"
2017-05-22 15:53:16	keveloper	and he was like "this isnt an upgrade my shit issue this is a meteor issue"
2017-05-22 15:53:18	keveloper	i didn't say anything
2017-05-22 15:53:30	keveloper	but i bet that i was just ES6 classes so meteor would be fine with it
2017-05-22 15:53:30	keveloper	idk
2017-05-22 15:53:38	keveloper	idk how he doesn't know anything

2017-05-23 09:14:45	na_th_an	but doesn't "get" it yet I think
2017-05-23 09:15:01	na_th_an	like she was asking if her pr to integration would include my stuff 
2017-05-23 09:15:04	na_th_an	and was just kinda unsure
2017-05-23 09:15:16	na_th_an	afaik kat still hasn't done anything
2017-05-23 09:15:22	na_th_an	rashmi was asking for ideas for less technical tasks
2017-05-23 09:15:37	keveloper	uh
2017-05-23 09:15:44	na_th_an	kibana was floated 
2017-05-23 09:15:47	keveloper	floated
2017-05-23 09:15:48	keveloper	oh
2017-05-23 09:15:51	na_th_an	maybe a dashboard
2017-05-23 09:15:55	keveloper	eh
2017-05-23 09:15:57	na_th_an	would that be good
2017-05-23 09:16:00	keveloper	maybe
2017-05-23 09:16:07	keveloper	she would have to know what informatino to put on it
2017-05-23 09:16:33	keveloper	_ie11PlaceholderFix: function () {
2017-05-23 09:16:39	keveloper	i think i've just stoppoed caring lol
2017-05-23 09:17:04	na_th_an	lol
2017-05-23 09:17:19	na_th_an	it was a 10/10 dumb bug
2017-05-23 09:17:25	na_th_an	placeholder text became value of textarea in ie11
2017-05-23 09:17:27	na_th_an	only textarea 
2017-05-23 09:17:29	na_th_an	only ie11 
2017-05-23 09:17:37	na_th_an	and only when the html is dynamically injected
2017-05-23 09:20:33	na_th_an	and for that bug the title of the ticket brett wrote is "IE11- Informative dialog is displaying on Personal lists"
2017-05-23 09:21:05	keveloper	what does that mean lol
2017-05-23 09:21:09	na_th_an	idk
2017-05-23 09:21:13	na_th_an	brett's tickets never make sense
2017-05-23 09:21:24	keveloper	wait so what was the bug
2017-05-23 09:21:29	keveloper	placholder text would be incorrect
2017-05-23 09:21:36	na_th_an	when you pressed "create personal list"
2017-05-23 09:21:42	na_th_an	a textarea appeared at the top
2017-05-23 09:21:45	na_th_an	where you could put a description
2017-05-23 09:21:49	keveloper	ok
2017-05-23 09:21:57	na_th_an	it said "Limit description to 1000 words" in the placeholder text
2017-05-23 09:22:05	na_th_an	ie11 put that placeholder in the value
2017-05-23 09:22:34	keveloper	and brett said
2017-05-23 09:22:38	na_th_an	<textarea placeholder="foo"></textarea> became <textarea placeholder="foo">foo</textarea> after injecting html
2017-05-23 09:22:42	na_th_an	there was no dialog at all
2017-05-23 09:22:46	keveloper	"IE11- Informative dialog is displaying on Personal lists"
2017-05-23 09:22:47	na_th_an	no dialog anywhere

2017-05-23 10:17:01	na_th_an	maybe he's never worked on something that uses isoft before
2017-05-23 10:17:04	keveloper	junior dev

2017-05-23 10:17:32	 *	keveloper spends 3 seconds on it
2017-05-23 10:17:40	keveloper	'because apache didn't statrt'
2017-05-23 10:17:42	keveloper	---
2017-05-23 10:17:44	keveloper	-_--_--_--_-
2017-05-23 10:17:59	na_th_an	yeah i really don't know how some people don't know some things
2017-05-23 10:18:13	keveloper	JJ looks bored as fuck
2017-05-23 10:18:25	na_th_an	"this is why you regression test"
2017-05-23 10:18:28	na_th_an	so glad i'm listening to this
2017-05-23 10:18:44	keveloper	whats he thinking right now
2017-05-23 10:18:56	na_th_an	I'm thinking "this will never work"
2017-05-23 10:19:01	keveloper	he looks displeased
2017-05-23 10:19:06	na_th_an	having non-technical people write automated tests is not a good idea
2017-05-23 10:19:21	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-23 10:19:29	na_th_an	that's seriously a great use of interns
2017-05-23 10:19:36	na_th_an	it's right at their skill level
2017-05-23 10:19:45	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-23 10:19:46	na_th_an	gives them something to do and learn on that's not critical code
2017-05-23 10:19:52	na_th_an	they can learn the product
2017-05-23 10:21:04	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-23 10:21:10	keveloper	also
2017-05-23 10:21:29	keveloper	i would not be able to really understand kibana when i started as an intern
2017-05-23 10:21:36	na_th_an	kibana is kinda complicated
2017-05-23 10:21:40	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-23 10:21:49	na_th_an	but so is pretty much everything we do
2017-05-23 10:21:52	na_th_an	this is a bad team for interns
2017-05-23 10:21:58	na_th_an	especially interns who we don't interview
2017-05-23 10:22:09	na_th_an	I've literally told rashmi that we get an intern from hr they won't know anything
2017-05-23 10:22:12	keveloper	and explaining to her that our production logs are JSON objects and kibana parses those logs so they are searchable for us so we can find stands and speecific values associated with each request through the stack
2017-05-23 10:22:14	na_th_an	i told her that they didn't interview them
2017-05-23 10:22:35	keveloper	what joe talking about
2017-05-23 10:22:54	na_th_an	someone wrote tests for code that wasn't written yet
2017-05-23 10:22:57	na_th_an	and then went on vacation
2017-05-23 10:23:01	na_th_an	then joe ran them when the code was written
2017-05-23 10:23:03	na_th_an	and it worked
2017-05-23 10:23:06	keveloper	wow no way
2017-05-23 10:23:08	keveloper	groundbreaking
2017-05-23 10:23:19	keveloper	if we write code and go on vacation does the code still work
2017-05-23 10:23:22	na_th_an	it is in oclc

2017-05-24 08:38:44	keveloper	what if i just converted all the soy to jsp lol
2017-05-24 08:38:44	na_th_an	have you never looked at the doc
2017-05-24 08:38:50	keveloper	i have before
2017-05-24 08:38:53	na_th_an	https://developers.google.com/closure/templates/docs/overview?csw=1

2017-05-24 08:39:01	na_th_an	ya they're called closure templates
2017-05-24 08:39:20	na_th_an	we call them soy
2017-05-24 08:39:24	na_th_an	because it's shorter than "the closure"
2017-05-24 08:39:38	na_th_an	because everything is 'the'
2017-05-24 08:39:54	keveloper	anyway
2017-05-24 08:39:58	keveloper	thats not frontend
2017-05-24 08:40:05	na_th_an	i know

2017-05-24 08:41:15	keveloper	i would wanna design it myself tho
2017-05-24 08:42:54	keveloper	is that an idp thing
2017-05-24 08:42:55	keveloper	idk
2017-05-24 08:43:12	keveloper	i really wanted to just give a shot at the separated backend frontend thing
2017-05-24 08:43:16	keveloper	and make like one page with it
2017-05-24 08:43:18	keveloper	as a POC
2017-05-24 08:43:38	na_th_an	do it 
2017-05-24 08:43:40	na_th_an	as a dashboard
2017-05-24 08:43:53	keveloper	separated frontend/backend dashboard?
2017-05-24 08:44:00	na_th_an	ya
2017-05-24 08:44:01	na_th_an	why not
2017-05-24 08:44:09	keveloper	there

2017-05-24 08:44:26	na_th_an	jk
2017-05-24 08:44:31	na_th_an	:)
2017-05-24 08:44:33	na_th_an	<3
2017-05-24 08:44:34	keveloper	lol
2017-05-24 08:44:38	na_th_an	:o
2017-05-24 08:45:34	na_th_an	lol
2017-05-24 08:45:56	keveloper	view looks cool tho
2017-05-24 08:46:02	keveloper	vue sry
2017-05-24 08:46:15	na_th_an	yea it's like all the good parts of react and angular together from what I can tell
2017-05-24 08:46:20	keveloper	oh rly
2017-05-24 08:46:21	na_th_an	it's pretty lightweight and straightforward
2017-05-24 08:46:28	na_th_an	it's all valid html
2017-05-24 08:46:51	na_th_an	I've heard good things about it 
2017-05-24 08:47:57	keveloper	it looks really cool
2017-05-24 08:48:07	keveloper	it doesn't support javascript classes tho i cant use it
2017-05-24 08:48:25	na_th_an	what do you mean it doesn't support them?
2017-05-24 08:48:31	keveloper	are there any cool rest things i can do
2017-05-24 08:48:42	keveloper	idek how much of a backend i will have to make honestly
2017-05-24 08:49:08	na_th_an	you'll still want one because of CORS
2017-05-24 08:49:17	na_th_an	your ajax requests will want to go to the same origin
2017-05-24 08:49:27	na_th_an	and then your backend will make requests to amp or whatever
2017-05-24 08:49:33	na_th_an	that's also good separation of concerns
2017-05-24 08:49:45	keveloper	#trutru
2017-05-24 08:49:48	na_th_an	it won't be that much logic in the backend but that's a good thing
2017-05-24 08:49:52	keveloper	idek if i was gonna use amp
2017-05-24 08:50:01	keveloper	amp is the thing that reports false negatives all the time
2017-05-24 08:50:02	na_th_an	I SAID OR WHATEVER
2017-05-24 08:50:04	na_th_an	jeez
2017-05-24 08:50:13	keveloper	I MIGHT JUST HIT THE APPS DIRECTLY
2017-05-24 08:50:16	na_th_an	:o
2017-05-24 08:50:19	keveloper	IS THAT BAD
2017-05-24 08:50:22	keveloper	SO SAD
2017-05-24 08:50:30	na_th_an	but what does that say about traffic to our applications
2017-05-24 08:50:35	na_th_an	if we do a health check every 5 minutes
2017-05-24 08:50:43	na_th_an	do we need to worry about that increased traffic
2017-05-24 08:50:47	na_th_an	do you remember that
2017-05-24 08:50:49	keveloper	idk if youre joking or not
2017-05-24 08:50:49	na_th_an	i forget who that was
2017-05-24 08:50:51	keveloper	oh
2017-05-24 08:51:01	na_th_an	i think you were here for that
2017-05-24 08:51:10	keveloper	it sounds familliar
2017-05-24 08:51:25	na_th_an	it was in a big health check meeting JB had with all 4 of the eus teams
2017-05-24 08:51:31	na_th_an	and he kept yelling about ping checks
2017-05-24 08:51:56	keveloper	lol
2017-05-24 08:52:19	keveloper	didnt he think health checks should be like an SME test
2017-05-24 08:52:32	na_th_an	he was saying it should at least exercise the system in some way
2017-05-24 08:52:41	keveloper	oh
2017-05-24 08:52:43	na_th_an	like not just be "oh it's responding to HTTP HEAD"
2017-05-24 08:52:50	keveloper	lol
2017-05-24 08:52:55	keveloper	idk
2017-05-24 08:53:15	keveloper	how often would a service respond to http head meaning the server is running but like... the app isn't deployed there?
2017-05-24 08:53:16	keveloper	idk
2017-05-24 08:53:24	keveloper	idk how much of a concern that is
2017-05-24 08:53:30	na_th_an	it is a completely valid one
2017-05-24 08:53:35	keveloper	ya
2017-05-24 08:53:39	na_th_an	that an app could be up but not functioning in the way you expect
2017-05-24 08:53:49	na_th_an	SS could be working but there could be some error when I save a search
2017-05-24 08:53:50	keveloper	ya i suppose
2017-05-24 08:53:55	na_th_an	if my health check saves and deletes
2017-05-24 08:53:58	keveloper	we have a lot of health checks that do more than ping tho
2017-05-24 08:54:06	na_th_an	that's a lot better than just retrieving a search that i stored there
2017-05-24 08:54:20	na_th_an	yeah most of our health checks aren't that shitty
2017-05-24 08:54:34	keveloper	lets make a chat called #actuallyjustthedevteam
2017-05-24 08:54:35	na_th_an	he was on about it because he was hoping that it'd reduce qa testing
2017-05-24 08:54:38	na_th_an	but that's never going to happen
2017-05-24 08:54:42	keveloper	and have it actually be just the dev team
2017-05-24 08:54:47	na_th_an	lol why tho
2017-05-24 08:54:47	keveloper	because i wanna talk about idp to the devs
2017-05-24 08:54:49	keveloper	without rashmi seeing
2017-05-24 08:54:55	na_th_an	what do you have to hide
2017-05-24 08:55:01	na_th_an	#takedoorsoffbathroomstalls

2017-05-24 09:12:35	na_th_an	i went into bcn because it leveled out
2017-05-24 09:12:56	na_th_an	and i feel like it's not likely to plummet
2017-05-24 09:12:59	na_th_an	but somewhat likely to spike
2017-05-24 09:13:15	na_th_an	although it's going down rn
2017-05-24 09:13:22	na_th_an	maybe a good time to buy tho
2017-05-24 09:13:27	keveloper	GNO looks promissing
2017-05-24 09:13:33	keveloper	its been going up for like a week steadily
2017-05-24 09:13:34	keveloper	no drops
2017-05-24 09:13:40	keveloper	but no spikes either
2017-05-24 09:14:03	keveloper	its high right now though im not buying atm
2017-05-24 09:14:13	keveloper	i dont see anything thats looks great rn
2017-05-24 09:14:14	na_th_an	it'd be fun to try to write a bot to trade for you
2017-05-24 09:14:20	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-24 09:14:22	keveloper	with like $10
2017-05-24 09:14:24	keveloper	tho
2017-05-24 09:14:25	keveloper	because
2017-05-24 09:14:29	keveloper	dangerous af
2017-05-24 09:14:29	na_th_an	well i'd run it with fake money for awhile
2017-05-24 09:14:38	na_th_an	not actually trade
2017-05-24 09:14:41	keveloper	091422 keveloper | with like $10what would you look for tho

2017-05-24 09:14:51	na_th_an	idk
2017-05-24 09:14:52	keveloper	the bot i mean
2017-05-24 09:14:59	na_th_an	neural net magic
2017-05-24 09:15:02	na_th_an	fuck you

2017-05-24 09:15:13	keveloper	i think ya
2017-05-24 09:15:51	keveloper	what do you look at when youre thinking about buying
2017-05-24 09:16:13	keveloper	i feel like sells and buys being close to the trend line is a good sign
2017-05-24 09:16:14	keveloper	idk tho
2017-05-24 09:16:28	keveloper	as opposed to like spiking everywhere
2017-05-24 09:16:42	na_th_an	probably an indication of volatility
2017-05-24 09:16:59	keveloper	risk vs  reward factor
2017-05-24 09:17:32	na_th_an	ya
2017-05-24 09:18:26	keveloper	im gonna hold str

2017-05-24 09:19:36	keveloper	nooooooooooooo
2017-05-24 09:19:55	keveloper	how many people make money off of this
2017-05-24 09:19:58	keveloper	i feel like
2017-05-24 09:20:02	keveloper	80% of people lose money
2017-05-24 09:20:06	keveloper	and 20% of people gain a lot lol
2017-05-24 09:20:22	keveloper	i would bet money on that considering the 80/20 rule
2017-05-24 09:20:47	keveloper	str doesn't look great rn but i think its stable
2017-05-24 09:20:48	na_th_an	you're probably not far off
2017-05-24 09:21:03	keveloper	the 80/20 rule is like one of my fav things its really cool
2017-05-24 09:21:09	na_th_an	historically if you hodl bitcoin for long enough you're gonna make money
2017-05-24 09:21:25	na_th_an	RB team works less hours than our team i feel like
2017-05-24 09:21:33	keveloper	idk i havaent noticed

2017-05-24 09:22:51	keveloper	do you think if i keep chatting in the troll box aobut how people should by STR then it will go up
2017-05-24 09:23:19	na_th_an	maybe

2017-05-24 09:27:53	keveloper	ikr
2017-05-24 09:28:11	keveloper	they literally just review technologies and are like "MMMMMMMM okay"
2017-05-24 09:28:25	keveloper	like how about if our team finds that a technology would be useful for us then we can use it
2017-05-24 09:28:31	na_th_an	vue would fit perfectly into discoveryui without fucking up existing things at all
2017-05-24 09:28:34	keveloper	like trust your devs to not use something shitty with a bunch of security issues
2017-05-24 09:29:09	keveloper	im interested in replace our angular stuff with vue
2017-05-24 09:29:17	keveloper	what if i redid all of our js in vue
2017-05-24 09:29:19	keveloper	in a week
2017-05-24 09:29:35	keveloper	2 weeks later 25% of it would be jquery
2017-05-24 09:29:45	keveloper	i might use semantic for the dashboard thign
2017-05-24 09:29:57	keveloper	what did you not like about semantic
2017-05-24 09:30:07	keveloper	also where is kat
2017-05-24 09:30:11	na_th_an	idk I was just having a hard time with the documentation 
2017-05-24 09:30:24	na_th_an	I just didn't "get" it
2017-05-24 09:30:29	keveloper	lol what
2017-05-24 09:30:35	keveloper	like
2017-05-24 09:30:35	na_th_an	and after being mad at it for a few nights in a row I just stopped trying
2017-05-24 09:30:46	keveloper	like you didn't know how to produce what you were envisioning?
2017-05-24 09:30:54	na_th_an	idk i feel like there was a piece of the documentation that I just couldn't find
2017-05-24 09:31:07	na_th_an	I couldn't find any good information about how to lay things out
2017-05-24 09:31:13	na_th_an	and like, what the recommended way to do things were
2017-05-24 09:31:17	na_th_an	i couldn't find any basic examples
2017-05-24 09:31:31	keveloper	its js does the framework really need to support internationalization itself
2017-05-24 09:32:57	keveloper	that commit idea is actually really cool
2017-05-24 09:59:23	keveloper	i have a cool idea for what the dashboard would be like
2017-05-24 09:59:24	keveloper	so
2017-05-24 09:59:33	keveloper	that would be cool if theres like diff tabs right
2017-05-24 09:59:37	keveloper	and one tab is "Overview"
2017-05-24 09:59:40	keveloper	and one tab is "Health"
2017-05-24 09:59:55	keveloper	and one tab is "Test Results" or something
2017-05-24 10:00:13	na_th_an	and another is "Oh shit" that lists recent exceptions, warnings, and errors
2017-05-24 10:00:48	keveloper	overview would have that
2017-05-24 10:00:50	keveloper	as red banners
2017-05-24 10:00:59	keveloper	and each env will be easily navigated to and from
2017-05-24 10:01:05	keveloper	instead memorizing fucking query params
2017-05-24 10:01:06	keveloper	AGH
2017-05-24 10:01:10	keveloper	why is our current dashboard so bad
2017-05-24 10:01:43	keveloper	ah this is gonna be dope
2017-05-24 10:01:47	keveloper	you just wait
2017-05-24 10:01:58	keveloper	its gonna be really intutive and beautiful and meaningful and awesome
2017-05-24 10:02:12	keveloper	and the backend is going to be useful RESTapi so we can use it agian for other notifications if we want
2017-05-24 10:02:27	keveloper	im really excited now
2017-05-24 10:02:35	keveloper	i just get to do that for 40 hours
2017-05-24 10:02:43	keveloper	im probably gonna work late those days loool

2017-05-24 10:03:17	keveloper	im 100% using bulma this shit looks awesome
2017-05-24 10:04:07	keveloper	k so my stack is mvn/springboot (thats all i know for backend), front end is going to be a webpack app with ES6 transpiling and source map and vue.js and bulma for css

2017-05-24 10:04:52	keveloper	yeah
2017-05-24 10:05:00	keveloper	and what to call them
2017-05-24 10:05:14	na_th_an	kotlin in gradle will solve that
2017-05-24 10:05:20	na_th_an	but ya gradle is a bit weird
2017-05-24 10:05:27	na_th_an	i still like it more than maven tho

2017-05-24 11:18:48	keveloper	ok
2017-05-24 11:19:07	na_th_an	and the therapist told her that she has anxiety levels that are equal with someone that experienced severe childhood trauma or PTSD
2017-05-24 11:19:22	keveloper	is that like measurable
2017-05-24 11:19:28	na_th_an	and the therapist finds it fascinating that she didn't experience any major trauma but she's still experiencing the anxiety she is
2017-05-24 11:19:37	na_th_an	i mean yeah when you're getting panic attacks and don't eat for 4 days

2017-05-24 11:21:11	na_th_an	yeah her therapist suggested some and told her to consider it

2017-05-24 13:46:39	na_th_an	rick is explaining ubiquity to jim
2017-05-24 13:46:53	na_th_an	"it installs java with the app"
2017-05-24 13:46:55	na_th_an	"wow"
2017-05-24 13:47:36	na_th_an	"if they're gonna talk to each other jassi and apache have to go on the same box"
2017-05-24 13:47:48	na_th_an	the things they say make me cringe
2017-05-24 13:51:18	keveloper	box
2017-05-24 13:51:21	keveloper	talk
2017-05-24 13:51:29	keveloper	the boxes talk to eachother na_th_an 
2017-05-24 13:51:32	na_th_an	"because they used an int they can only access 2gb of memory"
2017-05-24 13:51:33	keveloper	#webDevelopment
2017-05-24 13:51:41	na_th_an	they're saying java can't use more than 2gb of memory
2017-05-24 13:51:50	keveloper	huh
2017-05-24 13:51:52	na_th_an	and they don't realize that 4gb is the 32 bit memory limit
2017-05-24 13:51:53	keveloper	are you sure
2017-05-24 13:51:55	na_th_an	yes
2017-05-24 13:52:00	keveloper	lol
2017-05-24 13:52:00	keveloper	what
2017-05-24 13:52:05	na_th_an	they're confused
2017-05-24 13:52:17	na_th_an	32 bit java is constrained to a 32 bit address spcae
2017-05-24 13:52:20	na_th_an	which is 4gb
2017-05-24 13:52:27	na_th_an	that's why we had to change to 64bit cpus, to use more memory
2017-05-24 13:52:36	na_th_an	but they think it's 2gb
2017-05-24 13:52:48	na_th_an	and they also think we're still using 32 bit java in ubiquity i guess
2017-05-24 13:53:03	keveloper	lol
2017-05-24 13:53:03	keveloper	well
2017-05-24 14:00:52	keveloper	i bet charles  smells this fart

2017-05-25 10:25:41	na_th_an	Vigil deleted a function. Won't that cause the functions that call it to fail?
2017-05-25 10:25:43	na_th_an	It would seem that those functions appear to be corrupted as well. Run Vigil again and it will take care of that for you. Several invocations may be required to fully excise all bugs from your code.
2017-05-25 10:25:45	na_th_an	so dank
2017-05-25 10:26:00	keveloper	lolol

2017-05-25 11:07:31	keveloper	"I understand, but knowing that there is an issue and just going along with it without making a solid case to the client is your own fault"
2017-05-25 11:07:37	keveloper	"No offense, I’ve been doing this for 15 years"
2017-05-25 11:07:41	keveloper	first of all
2017-05-25 11:07:45	keveloper	"client" is a warning sign there
2017-05-25 11:07:48	keveloper	also
2017-05-25 11:07:53	keveloper	if youve been doing this for 15 years

2017-05-25 11:15:19	na_th_an	I've seen that
2017-05-25 11:15:20	keveloper	and added build.gradle to my git ignore
2017-05-25 11:15:23	keveloper	it would still be tracked
2017-05-25 11:15:26	keveloper	because git knows about it
2017-05-25 11:15:28	na_th_an	ya bc she accidentally committed .DS_store
2017-05-25 11:15:34	keveloper	.gitignore just keeps things from being tracked by git
2017-05-25 11:15:35	keveloper	ya
2017-05-25 11:15:38	na_th_an	ya

2017-05-25 11:45:32	keveloper	"i started programming at 6 or 7 years old"
2017-05-25 11:45:33	na_th_an	you'll find that a lot of people with low self worth come to irc to feel better about themselves
2017-05-25 11:45:51	keveloper	he's 37

2017-05-25 11:48:25	na_th_an	i mean it would be some pretty basic programming
2017-05-25 11:48:46	na_th_an	the commodore 64 was released as a home comptuer in 1982
2017-05-25 11:48:54	na_th_an	and in order to use it at all you basically had to know how to "program"
2017-05-25 11:48:57	na_th_an	the shell was basic
2017-05-25 11:49:13	na_th_an	a lot of kids would do basic on home computers back then in the mid 80s because it was super easy to get started
2017-05-25 11:49:17	na_th_an	it WAS the computer
2017-05-25 12:53:26	keveloper	go look at was DLSteve just said what he thinks mid level is in #webev
2017-05-25 12:53:33	na_th_an	yeah I see that

2017-05-25 15:19:27	na_th_an	they saw slow java apps in the 90s and assume that's what java still is
2017-05-25 15:19:38	na_th_an	not the most performant, safe, and scalable web server language
2017-05-25 15:19:47	keveloper	lol

2017-05-25 15:55:19	keveloper	as far as being able to translate
2017-05-25 15:55:23	keveloper	that is correct right
2017-05-25 15:55:48	na_th_an	I believe so ya
2017-05-25 15:55:51	keveloper	ok
2017-05-25 16:15:19	keveloper	when you have to bookmark the label tag in the html5 spec because your teammates won't believe that <label>blah<input/></label> is a thing
2017-05-25 16:15:49	keveloper	so you don't have to use inline-block everytime you use a label
2017-05-25 16:17:02	keveloper	lol this jsp ugh
2017-05-25 16:17:12	keveloper	a giant if with 
2017-05-25 16:17:22	keveloper	if sortKey == TITLE use brief.srch.results.title
2017-05-25 16:17:47	keveloper	um idk how bout we just have everything use the same name so you can do brief.srch.results.{key}
2017-05-25 16:17:50	keveloper	-_-
2017-05-25 16:26:29	na_th_an	if we used request scoped beans our unit tests could be so much better
2017-05-25 16:26:46	na_th_an	half the point of spring was that you don't have to pass dependencies from the entry ponit to the business layer
2017-05-25 16:26:54	na_th_an	using DI things ask for what they need
2017-05-25 16:26:55	na_th_an	and they get them
2017-05-25 16:27:06	na_th_an	need a security context? cool, spring gives it to you, scoped to this request
2017-05-25 16:27:09	na_th_an	because you set it up for that
2017-05-25 16:27:32	na_th_an	you don't have to go work back 4 layers and make sure you pass it all the way down then go modify all the unit tests for passing the security context down to the business layer
2017-05-25 16:27:33	na_th_an	that's dumb
2017-05-25 16:27:50	na_th_an	I didn't know that was a debate they had about DUI but I think they made the wrong decision there
2017-05-25 16:28:28	keveloper	ya
2017-05-25 16:44:50	keveloper	you have any idea if spring:message code is case insensitive
2017-05-25 23:17:11	<--	na_th_an (~na_th_an@172.ip-158-69-48.net) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 1.7.1)

2017-05-26 12:54:21	na_th_an	"I know what you have works and is clean code but please refactor it in this other way where we get more crap on the controller just to pass it down to the view layer, alse it won't even work"
2017-05-26 12:54:31	na_th_an	the way bryan told me to do this isn't even working
2017-05-26 12:54:34	na_th_an	the auth is null

2017-07-17 15:01:25	na_th_an	if rashmi were your manager she'd be pushing for that really hard
2017-07-17 15:01:28	keveloper	i feel quite accountable tho lol
2017-07-17 15:01:32	na_th_an	but bill's probably like "there's nothing I can do"
2017-07-17 15:01:43	keveloper	i think both bill and rashmi are they just can't promote except every 6 months or whatever
2017-07-17 15:01:58	na_th_an	that's true but rashmi pushes harder on that shit
2017-07-17 15:02:12	keveloper	idk bill is aware that i know i'm undervalued

2017-07-20 16:40:37	keveloper	You are a very kind person.
2017-07-20 16:40:54	keveloper	also i feel like that module is broken because i havent seen 90% of those
2017-07-21 14:04:08	keveloper	i wonder how far we'd be right now if someone else was on the install last night
2017-07-21 14:04:30	keveloper	like i wish we could have observed all possible outcomes with everyone on the team lol
2017-07-21 14:05:04	na_th_an	lol
2017-07-21 14:05:16	keveloper	do you never wonder that
2017-07-21 14:05:31	keveloper	like if everything went the same except ___ was doing it what would have happened
2017-07-21 14:05:33	keveloper	i wonder that a lot
2017-07-21 14:05:44	keveloper	like would bryan or zach have figured it out faster etc.
2017-07-24 09:54:13	keveloper	should we care about yash using vanilla js sekector methods
2017-07-24 09:54:21	keveloper	like should we use jquery because everything else does
2017-07-24 09:54:33	na_th_an	I think so but idc that much so I'm deferring that to a tech lead
2017-07-24 09:54:39	na_th_an	I care more about redefining constants
2017-07-24 09:55:00	keveloper	bryan is not going to comment on that lol
2017-07-24 09:55:10	na_th_an	I'm also confused on why UX wanted a 6 second pluse
2017-07-24 09:55:12	na_th_an	that's slow af
2017-07-24 09:55:14	na_th_an	but ok
2017-07-24 09:55:27	keveloper	have you seen it
2017-07-24 09:55:33	keveloper	can you even tell it's happened
2017-07-24 09:55:33	na_th_an	yeah
2017-07-24 09:55:36	keveloper	happening*
2017-07-24 09:55:44	na_th_an	it's just slowly fading in the star basically
2017-07-24 09:55:48	na_th_an	then jumps to filled it
2017-07-24 09:55:50	na_th_an	filled in
2017-07-24 09:55:54	keveloper	that's dumb
2017-07-24 09:55:58	na_th_an	not really what I was picturing when we were talking about it
2017-07-24 09:55:59	keveloper	ask binaebi
2017-07-24 09:56:00	na_th_an	yeah
2017-07-24 09:56:12	keveloper	do an svg outline animation
2017-07-24 09:56:13	keveloper	lol
2017-07-24 09:56:14	na_th_an	it should be like 1second but whatever
2017-07-24 09:56:17	keveloper	is the star an svg
2017-07-24 09:56:24	na_th_an	i don't think so
2017-07-24 16:42:07	na_th_an	I wonder how often yash is like "idk wtf they're talking about"
2017-07-24 16:42:17	keveloper	lollll
2017-07-24 16:42:22	keveloper	because of the american internet dank stuff?
2017-07-24 16:42:33	na_th_an	ya we internet meme lingo p hard
2017-07-24 16:42:37	keveloper	yeah
2017-07-24 16:42:59	na_th_an	I'm also p curious about his religion
2017-07-24 16:43:06	na_th_an	not in a discriminatory kind of way
2017-07-24 16:43:07	na_th_an	just curious
2017-07-24 16:43:12	keveloper	i wonder if thats why he doesn't drink
2017-07-24 16:43:22	na_th_an	it's possible but it's also a big culture thing
2017-07-24 16:43:52	na_th_an	I think hindus can drink by their religion
2017-07-24 16:43:54	na_th_an	but not muslims
2017-07-24 16:44:17	na_th_an	i just don't wanna be like "hey are you muslim"
2017-07-24 16:44:21	na_th_an	but I'm curious
2017-07-24 16:44:27	na_th_an	i wanna learn about cultures yanno
2017-07-24 16:59:04	keveloper	ya
2017-07-25 09:24:35	na_th_an	brett didn't know who yash is this morning
2017-07-25 09:24:41	na_th_an	bridget was saying yash did a ticket
2017-07-25 09:24:47	na_th_an	and brett was like "who?"
2017-07-25 09:25:08	keveloper	lol

2017-07-25 09:40:37	keveloper	i was talking to her about music
2017-07-25 09:40:40	keveloper	i started the convo with
2017-07-25 09:40:51	keveloper	Do you listen to EDM? I thought I heard you listening to “Faded” by Alan Walker the other day :stuck_out_tongue:
2017-07-25 09:41:00	keveloper	and she said FADED yes :slightly_smiling_face:
2017-07-25 09:41:05	keveloper	then we started talking about stuff
2017-07-25 09:41:12	keveloper	then she said she wanted to dance on her desk
2017-07-25 09:41:16	keveloper	and sent me a gif of her dancing
2017-07-25 09:41:35	keveloper	i wanna show you but she's right behind you

2017-07-25 09:59:57	keveloper	There is literally no validation in these wireframes ergh
2017-07-25 10:11:42	na_th_an	bryan said he'd get to my pull requests this morning
2017-07-25 10:11:45	na_th_an	I wonder if he really will
2017-07-25 10:11:57	keveloper	he's in jira right now i think
2017-07-25 10:12:05	keveloper	he probably wont unless you remind him
2017-07-25 10:12:46	na_th_an	I reminded him at scrum of scrums and he said he'd do it
2017-07-25 10:18:50	keveloper	okay now brett's IE11 is saying trim() doesn't exist
2017-07-25 10:18:52	keveloper	on a string
2017-07-25 10:19:19	na_th_an	wut
2017-07-25 10:19:28	na_th_an	just brett's ie11 or
2017-07-25 10:19:38	keveloper	well it seems to work fine on another laptop with IE11
2017-07-25 10:19:41	keveloper	so im really confused
2017-07-25 10:22:04	na_th_an	just use jquery
2017-07-25 10:34:47	keveloper	he had compatability mode turned on for intranet sites
2017-07-25 10:35:01	keveloper	which basically means use IE8 feature set
2017-07-25 10:35:14	na_th_an	10/10 best qa tester
2017-07-25 10:35:25	keveloper	idk if i should redo the each stuff now to vanilla JS or not
2017-07-25 10:35:28	keveloper	it doesn't really matter
2017-07-25 10:35:29	na_th_an	he's been here for like 10 years
2017-07-25 10:35:32	keveloper	forEach is cleaner tho
2017-07-25 11:06:24	keveloper	i am geniunely curious about the worth of that EAO thing
2017-07-25 11:06:28	keveloper	like how much do they get paid to do this
2017-07-25 11:06:33	keveloper	obviously some research is good but
2017-07-25 11:06:51	na_th_an	yeah 
2017-07-25 13:02:42	keveloper	i've never set up an SSL cert on a host and I honestly don't know how lol
2017-07-25 13:02:53	keveloper	how'd you do yours
2017-07-25 13:03:29	na_th_an	let's encrypt
2017-07-25 13:03:33	keveloper	certbot?
2017-07-25 13:03:45	na_th_an	ya
2017-07-25 13:03:59	na_th_an	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Let%E2%80%99s_Encrypt
2017-07-25 13:04:11	na_th_an	then I had to do some config for lighttpd
2017-07-25 13:04:19	keveloper	uhhh
2017-07-25 13:04:24	keveloper	im using python's server
2017-07-25 13:04:36	na_th_an	don't
2017-07-25 13:04:45	keveloper	uh
2017-07-25 13:04:49	keveloper	ok
2017-07-25 13:04:53	keveloper	i need a server that can run python
2017-07-25 13:05:08	na_th_an	i'd bet apache can do it
2017-07-25 13:05:25	na_th_an	or do idk what you're doing
2017-07-25 13:05:29	keveloper	cgi
2017-07-25 13:05:29	keveloper	ugh
2017-07-25 13:05:42	keveloper	it's a contact controller
2017-07-25 13:05:42	na_th_an	i thought by python's server you were just talking about the simple http server to serve static content
2017-07-25 13:05:45	keveloper	noo
2017-07-25 13:06:09	keveloper	i'm running python's HTTPServer to handle a POST request from my portfolio
2017-07-25 13:06:19	keveloper	to email my gmail with contacts
2017-07-25 13:06:56	keveloper	but yeah i could use apache with cgi
2017-07-25 13:07:01	keveloper	to execute python
2017-07-25 13:07:04	na_th_an	that's probably the 'correct' way to do it
2017-07-25 13:07:06	keveloper	otherwise idk how to do this
2017-07-25 13:07:07	na_th_an	idk tho
2017-07-25 13:07:21	na_th_an	idk how to deploy python for production web services
2017-07-25 13:07:23	keveloper	https://www.piware.de/2011/01/creating-an-https-server-in-python/
2017-07-25 13:07:31	keveloper	i doubt that's acceptable
2017-07-25 13:07:35	keveloper	I can do apache/cgi
2017-07-25 13:07:51	keveloper	as of right now my contact form doesn't work over https
2017-07-25 13:08:23	keveloper	also i think my domain is about to expire
2017-07-25 13:08:24	na_th_an	ya that's bad
2017-07-25 13:08:26	na_th_an	lol
2017-07-25 13:08:46	keveloper	ugh
2017-07-25 13:08:53	keveloper	namecheap is down
2017-07-25 13:09:10	na_th_an	I have a merge conflict in the .txt file that's used by those shitty unit tests
2017-07-25 13:09:12	na_th_an	sigh
2017-07-25 13:09:21	keveloper	so does certbot put a cert file somewhere i can link to with python
2017-07-25 13:09:45	na_th_an	yeah it puts them in like /etc/letsencrypt
2017-07-25 13:09:57	na_th_an	you'll have to give the user that runs the server permission to read the files
2017-07-25 13:10:02	keveloper	ah so I could easily set it up
2017-07-25 13:10:36	keveloper	wait
2017-07-25 13:10:45	keveloper	what was I doing with haveged back in the day
2017-07-25 13:11:13	na_th_an	uhhh ssh key maybe?
2017-07-25 13:11:24	keveloper	i can't remember
2017-07-25 13:11:25	na_th_an	something with entropy
2017-07-25 13:11:49	na_th_an	I think it was creating an ssh key
2017-07-25 13:12:02	keveloper	something around cron?
2017-07-25 13:12:06	keveloper	or installing cron?
2017-07-25 13:12:52	na_th_an	I think you needed an ssh key so you could run the minecraft backups
2017-07-25 13:13:07	keveloper	i never did remote
2017-07-25 13:13:22	keveloper	i think it was when i tried to start cron or something that cron uses
2017-07-25 13:13:44	na_th_an	oh ya that sounds right
2017-07-25 13:14:07	na_th_an	http://git.ent.oclc.org/projects/DISC/repos/discoveryui/pull-requests/632/overview

2017-07-26 16:09:47	na_th_an	lol
2017-07-26 16:09:49	na_th_an	probably
2017-07-26 16:23:57	na_th_an	i've been sitting around since 2pm waiting for code reviwes 
2017-07-26 16:24:10	na_th_an	or for it to be time to go
2017-07-26 16:24:25	keveloper	lolllllllllll
2017-07-26 16:24:31	keveloper	killllll usssssssss plzzzzzzzz
2017-07-26 16:24:35	keveloper	wtf is a provider
2017-07-26 16:24:37	keveloper	like actually
2017-07-26 16:24:54	na_th_an	it's a class from DR
2017-07-26 16:24:57	keveloper	really
2017-07-26 16:25:04	na_th_an	no I'm just making shit up bc I'm bored
2017-07-26 16:25:11	keveloper	oh nice
2017-07-26 16:25:31	keveloper	like wtf should a provider _do_
2017-07-26 16:25:42	keveloper	i need business logic about when the spelling suggestion request happens
2017-07-26 16:25:47	keveloper	should that be in the provider??!?!?!?!?!?!??!!?/
2017-07-26 16:25:49	keveloper	/////
2017-07-26 16:26:05	keveloper	sometimes there is a SAL under the provider
2017-07-26 16:26:06	keveloper	wtf is DS
2017-07-26 16:26:16	na_th_an	add a business services module
2017-07-26 16:26:17	keveloper	i've never looked this closely at the design
2017-07-26 16:26:38	na_th_an	the only thing I know about DS is that it uses xml based configuration really really hard
2017-07-26 16:26:40	keveloper	there's a owc-opernul-registry-transfer-domain module
2017-07-26 16:26:42	keveloper	wtf is in that
2017-07-26 16:27:24	keveloper	wait
2017-07-26 16:27:32	na_th_an	obivously domain objects for transferring owc's openurl registry 
2017-07-26 16:27:35	keveloper	uhh
2017-07-26 16:27:44	keveloper	bryan was like make it a new endpoint
2017-07-26 16:28:00	keveloper	but then DUI needs logic about when to query DS for the suggestions
2017-07-26 16:28:02	keveloper	i guess that makes sense
2017-07-26 16:28:15	na_th_an	ya
2017-07-26 16:28:17	keveloper	owcBibSearch should not return shit about spelling suggestions
2017-07-26 16:28:26	keveloper	that was dumb whoever did that (jeff price)
2017-07-26 16:29:11	na_th_an	http requests are too expensive
2017-07-26 16:29:17	na_th_an	gotta put it all in one response
2017-07-26 16:30:28	keveloper	what should spelling suggestion end point be called
2017-07-26 16:30:49	na_th_an	/gimmeBetterSpelling
2017-07-26 16:30:51	keveloper	/spellingSuggestions/kw:doggeroni%20popsicles
2017-07-26 16:30:54	keveloper	or
2017-07-26 16:30:56	keveloper	lol
2017-07-26 16:31:04	keveloper	getSpellingSuggestions/
2017-07-26 16:31:06	na_th_an	it should be a query param
2017-07-26 16:31:07	keveloper	or just spellingSuggestions
2017-07-26 16:31:10	keveloper	oh right
2017-07-26 16:31:11	na_th_an	not a path param
2017-07-26 16:31:24	keveloper	/spellingSuggestions?query=kw:doggeroni
2017-07-26 16:31:56	na_th_an	/suggestions?type=spelling&query=kw:doggeroni&doItGood=yes
2017-07-26 16:32:13	na_th_an	doItGood determines if it searches google and returns their spelling suggestions or uses OCLC internal services
2017-07-26 16:32:34	keveloper	lol
2017-07-26 16:32:40	keveloper	im not doing suggestinos
2017-07-26 16:32:42	keveloper	suggestions for what
2017-07-26 16:32:44	keveloper	yanno
2017-07-26 16:32:44	na_th_an	/suggestions?type=spelling&query=kw:doggeroni&doItGood=yes&bugs=no
2017-07-26 16:32:59	keveloper	there was a post on r/rocketleague about bugs = no
2017-07-26 16:33:12	na_th_an	/suggestions?type=spelling&query=kw:doggeroni&doItGood=yes&bugs=no&punctuation=yes&preserveCapitalization=please
2017-07-26 16:34:41	keveloper	i can't find it but it was like
2017-07-26 16:35:13	keveloper	if (shouldHaveBugs) { //buggy code } else { //goodCode }
2017-07-26 16:35:19	keveloper	then he set shouldHaveBugs to false
2017-07-26 16:35:29	keveloper	and it was like "How people think developers fix bugs in this sub"
2017-07-26 16:35:48	na_th_an	how they really fix bugs: 'git revert'
2017-07-26 16:36:19	keveloper	https://confluence.oclc.org/pages/editpage.action?pageId=44979080
2017-07-26 16:36:25	keveloper	does that diagram make sense
2017-07-26 16:36:31	keveloper	the one in structural models
2017-07-26 16:36:57	na_th_an	10/10
2017-07-26 16:37:02	keveloper	idk if joke or not
2017-07-26 16:37:05	na_th_an	I'm glad there's a diagram
2017-07-26 16:37:08	keveloper	lol
2017-07-26 16:37:13	na_th_an	I didn't get the picture with a single sentence
2017-07-26 16:37:23	na_th_an	that would be impossible
2017-07-26 16:37:27	na_th_an	you'd need at least 1000 words
2017-07-26 16:37:43	keveloper	well that's convenient because a picture is wroth 1000 words
2017-07-26 16:38:07	keveloper	i wonder how many lazy/smart ass college students have turned in 2000 word papers as 2 pictures
2017-07-26 16:38:16	na_th_an	this has literally been my least productive day on the team ever maybe
2017-07-26 16:38:16	keveloper	and titled the paper "A picture is worth 1000 words"
2017-07-26 16:38:27	na_th_an	I've done so little this afternoon
2017-07-26 16:38:29	keveloper	christmas break when everyone was gone for me
2017-07-26 16:38:37	keveloper	but same i havent really done anything since like 1:30
2017-07-26 16:38:48	keveloper	besides changed a gliffy
2017-07-26 16:38:58	keveloper	and fuddled around in DS like "idk how to design this"
2017-07-26 16:38:58	na_th_an	I sat down after piada and thought "I'm not going to do anything until my pull requests are merged"
2017-07-26 16:40:02	keveloper	i think the #1 that bryan does that irks me is how talks about software like its sentient lol
2017-07-26 16:40:22	na_th_an	yeah I know what you mean
2017-07-26 16:40:30	keveloper	and is afraid to makes changes to apps so badly that he would rather shittily design something
2017-07-26 16:40:38	na_th_an	yup
2017-07-26 16:40:41	keveloper	and also he says "yanno" way too much and im like
2017-07-26 16:40:44	keveloper	"no"
2017-07-26 16:40:46	keveloper	"i dont"
2017-07-26 16:42:56	keveloper	ok so ds is literally
2017-07-26 16:43:06	keveloper	SpellingSuggestionController -> SpellingSuggestionProvider -> SOLR
2017-07-26 16:43:18	keveloper	oh and the StringToSpellingSuggestionConverter
2017-07-26 16:48:19	keveloper	wat
2017-07-26 16:48:29	na_th_an	abby left?
2017-07-26 16:48:40	keveloper	idk did she
2017-07-26 16:48:45	na_th_an	idk she gone
2017-07-26 16:48:54	na_th_an	idk what I'm going to do tonight
2017-07-26 16:48:59	na_th_an	I've already read reddit
2017-07-26 16:49:56	keveloper	should the controller use the StringToSPellingSuggestionConverter
2017-07-26 16:49:56	keveloper	no
2017-07-26 16:49:59	keveloper	probably the provider
2017-07-26 16:50:10	na_th_an	ya
2017-07-26 16:50:10	keveloper	so the provider will make the request and convert it to objects and reutrn it to the controller
2017-07-26 16:50:45	keveloper	https://confluence.oclc.org/pages/editpage.action?pageId=44979080
2017-07-26 16:50:48	keveloper	does the DS thing make sense
2017-07-26 16:50:51	keveloper	like this is overkill
2017-07-26 16:50:54	keveloper	this is not complicated
2017-07-26 16:51:27	keveloper	The DUI one might be a little more complicated but
2017-07-26 16:52:15	keveloper	abby is here
2017-07-26 16:52:28	keveloper	$10 she's about to leave tho
2017-07-26 16:53:35	keveloper	biin
2017-07-26 16:53:36	keveloper	boom
2017-07-26 16:54:22	keveloper	YES MY BBQ CHIPS ARENT STALE I AM KING
2017-07-27 09:07:44	keveloper	lol when yasho doesn't get our jokes
2017-07-27 09:08:09	na_th_an	he'll learn :)
2017-07-27 10:49:53	keveloper	ugh
2017-07-27 10:50:05	keveloper	like every method jimmy writes is like 
2017-07-27 10:50:06	keveloper	make a list
2017-07-27 10:50:07	keveloper	add shit
2017-07-27 10:50:08	keveloper	return the list
2017-07-27 10:50:20	na_th_an	he hasn't been using groovy that long
2017-07-27 10:50:23	na_th_an	it's still new to him
2017-07-27 10:50:29	na_th_an	he's definitely never seen collect being used
2017-07-27 10:50:34	keveloper	-_-
2017-07-27 10:50:49	keveloper	$10 he wont change it
2017-07-27 10:51:04	keveloper	both ying and charles approved this without commenting
2017-07-27 10:51:41	na_th_an	sighhh
2017-07-27 10:52:57	keveloper	https://0bin.net/paste/s7u3Fw9sx3OzlxfN#jmsmyue5ziBN2XyPEn8IhWaOAtmEZr8osFq9lCpPVEi
2017-07-27 10:53:00	keveloper	is that worth simplifying
2017-07-27 10:53:44	na_th_an	IMO yes
2017-07-27 10:53:50	keveloper	to what
2017-07-27 10:54:01	keveloper	collect inside a collect
2017-07-27 10:54:09	na_th_an	IMO you should collect the messageObjects into a list
2017-07-27 10:54:18	na_th_an	then collect on the messageObjects
2017-07-27 10:54:22	na_th_an	no nesting
2017-07-27 10:55:30	keveloper	hmm
2017-07-27 10:55:46	keveloper	yeah two collects one after eachother
2017-07-27 10:55:50	keveloper	after antoerh i mean
2017-07-27 10:56:38	na_th_an	ya
2017-07-27 11:03:09	keveloper	so either A) Jimmy and Bryan completely redesign how DUI/DS will use custom messages
2017-07-27 11:03:10	keveloper	or 
2017-07-27 11:03:17	keveloper	B) jimmy did this completely wrong
2017-07-27 11:03:36	na_th_an	which do you think is more likely
2017-07-27 11:04:33	keveloper	prolly the jimmy part but idk
2017-07-27 11:04:46	keveloper	shocker still waiting on lead reviews
2017-07-27 11:04:50	keveloper	sorry brett you gotta wait
2017-07-27 11:04:53	keveloper	for almost no reason
2017-07-27 11:05:00	keveloper	its not like bryan will have anything to say on these
2017-07-27 11:05:03	keveloper	i might just merge them
2017-07-27 11:18:45	keveloper	confirmed jimmy just did it wrong
2017-07-27 11:18:56	keveloper	he failed to properly parse an XML element
2017-07-27 11:18:58	keveloper	using a pojo
2017-07-27 11:19:02	keveloper	and put it in another pojo
2017-07-27 11:19:08	keveloper	lets just focus on that for a second
2017-07-27 11:19:28	keveloper	grade 18
2017-07-27 11:20:00	na_th_an	jesus christ
2017-07-27 11:20:09	keveloper	normally i dont catach functional shit in code reviews but that was SO obvious
2017-07-27 11:20:29	keveloper	so after two messages in #lac
2017-07-27 11:20:30	keveloper	and a pm
2017-07-27 11:20:35	keveloper	bryan has not reviewed my PRs
2017-07-27 11:20:41	keveloper	off to rich
2017-07-27 11:23:25	na_th_an	can you approve my pr
2017-07-27 11:25:39	keveloper	ya sorry got distrcated
2017-07-27 11:39:47	keveloper	rashmi is trying to compare my music production to her family video making right now
2017-07-27 11:39:48	keveloper	lol
2017-07-27 11:39:55	na_th_an	heh
2017-07-27 11:39:56	keveloper	"I start assembling the moments. and then search for a track that speaks to it. Sometimes its just the melody/rhythm and the lyrics won't necessarily line up"
2017-07-27 11:40:01	keveloper	i regret ever talking to her abouot music lol
2017-07-27 11:40:04	keveloper	bad decision
2017-07-27 11:40:24	keveloper	i wish people knew the time and attention to detail and experience it takes to make decent music
2017-07-27 11:40:27	keveloper	besides other music people
2017-07-27 14:12:28	keveloper	wtf
2017-07-27 14:12:34	keveloper	jimmy didnt reply to any of my comments about the design
2017-07-27 14:12:45	keveloper	then just kind of further rabbit holed himself into the shitty probably wrong design
2017-07-27 14:12:55	keveloper	also rich has comment
2017-07-27 14:12:56	keveloper	s
2017-07-27 14:13:01	keveloper	no response
2017-07-27 14:13:05	na_th_an	did he merge it?
2017-07-27 14:13:09	keveloper	no
2017-07-27 14:13:13	na_th_an	put 'needs work'
2017-07-27 14:13:21	keveloper	he just made another commit further committing to his design
2017-07-27 14:13:23	keveloper	that i think is wrong
2017-07-27 14:13:37	na_th_an	I'm sure he didn't even look at the code review comments before pushing that commit
2017-07-27 14:14:38	keveloper	yeah also people to need ot be less afraid of ocmmenting and marking as needs work
2017-07-27 14:14:41	keveloper	needs work is powerful
2017-07-27 14:14:55	na_th_an	rashmi literally said that
2017-07-27 14:15:05	na_th_an	idk if you were there or paying attention
2017-07-27 14:15:14	keveloper	said what
2017-07-27 14:15:35	na_th_an	that we need to less afraid of using the 'needs work' button on pull requests
2017-07-27 14:15:37	keveloper	i honestly almost didn't try with this design thing because i dont want to have to explain it to jimmy
2017-07-27 17:16:11	keveloper	yt
2017-07-27 18:50:20	na_th_an	i am now
2017-07-27 19:30:52	keveloper	did you see dan's email
2017-07-27 19:31:00	na_th_an	yeah
2017-07-27 19:31:13	keveloper	maybe one day i'll get a promotion
2017-07-27 19:31:17	keveloper	/s
2017-07-27 19:31:18	keveloper	no i wont
2017-07-27 19:31:19	na_th_an	you will for sure
2017-07-27 19:31:25	na_th_an	you totally will
2017-07-27 19:31:27	keveloper	Bill said "i'm trying"
2017-07-27 19:31:33	keveloper	"i'd had to promise something i can't"
2017-07-27 19:31:35	keveloper	or something
2017-07-27 19:31:41	na_th_an	there's no way they won't
2017-07-27 19:31:43	keveloper	but basically that he wants me to and is trying
2017-07-27 19:31:51	keveloper	well im gone like literally day after otherwise
2017-07-27 19:31:57	na_th_an	like he's not going to promise it when he can't
2017-07-27 19:32:02	keveloper	yeah i know
2017-07-27 19:32:04	keveloper	but like
2017-07-27 19:32:07	keveloper	idk
2017-07-27 19:32:10	keveloper	i have a feel they wont
2017-07-27 19:32:25	keveloper	i am the 2nd least paid dev on the team
2017-07-27 19:32:26	keveloper	if that
2017-07-27 19:32:33	keveloper	and if so, only by $980
2017-07-27 19:32:38	keveloper	but yash might even make more than me
2017-07-27 19:32:44	na_th_an	i highly doubt he does
2017-07-27 19:32:56	keveloper	k but if so its only $980 anyway
2017-07-27 19:33:11	keveloper	its just annoying to think about
2017-07-27 19:33:12	na_th_an	well you're probably about to get like 3% too
2017-07-27 19:33:18	na_th_an	but ya it's dumb af
2017-07-27 19:33:37	keveloper	if i get less than 3% i might go in to search mode
2017-07-27 19:33:48	na_th_an	you should 
2017-07-27 19:33:51	keveloper	and if i dont get promoted by december im gone
2017-07-27 19:33:56	na_th_an	that would be really dumb if you get 'on target'
2017-07-27 19:33:59	na_th_an	totally
2017-07-27 19:34:07	keveloper	if i get on target i'd love to see jimmy's review
2017-07-27 19:34:13	keveloper	is there an f
2017-07-27 19:34:28	na_th_an	honestly I bet he's about to get either on target with very negative remarks or below target
2017-07-27 19:34:47	na_th_an	rashmi knows he is not meeting expectations of a grade 18
2017-07-27 19:36:01	keveloper	lol there was some article about people teaching an AI to play doom
2017-07-27 19:36:15	keveloper	and they were like "should we be teaching AI to shoot people?" OoooOoOooOOOooooo
2017-07-27 19:36:18	keveloper	scarrrryyy futuuuureee
2017-07-27 19:36:39	na_th_an	lololol
2017-07-27 19:36:41	keveloper	fuckin hollywood
2017-07-27 19:36:45	keveloper	AI is scawwwwy
2017-07-27 19:36:56	na_th_an	it's funny because the military is literally doing that
2017-07-27 19:36:58	na_th_an	also like, cs bots
2017-07-27 19:37:12	keveloper	yeah i saw it and i was like "welp this has been around for 10+ years"
2017-07-27 19:37:17	na_th_an	ya rly
2017-07-27 19:37:44	keveloper	still annoyed by the "should the tesla hit 10 people or 1 person" bullshit lol
2017-07-27 19:38:12	na_th_an	but who was car
2017-07-27 19:38:25	keveloper	ya the tesla devs actually trained the autopilot to identify human facees and count how many humans it will hit and divert the car to hit a lesser group of humans
2017-07-27 19:38:32	keveloper	it will even do background checks to see if they are criminals
2017-07-27 19:38:48	na_th_an	and there's a database of people who got laid that week
2017-07-27 19:38:53	keveloper	yeah true
2017-07-27 19:38:56	na_th_an	they are prioritized for living in case they become parents soon
2017-07-27 19:39:20	keveloper	but then by the time it decides all this it just ends up hitting a pole anyway
2017-07-27 19:39:36	na_th_an	pole was car
2017-07-27 19:39:41	keveloper	:o
2017-07-27 19:39:46	keveloper	*x files music*
2017-07-27 19:41:01	keveloper	hey lets go lok at my poloniex portfolio
2017-07-27 19:41:03	 *	keveloper cries
2017-07-27 19:41:26	na_th_an	i'm right about even
2017-07-27 19:42:10	keveloper	"For your security, we have emailed you a one-time authentication code."
2017-07-27 19:42:13	keveloper	uhh no ya didnt
2017-07-27 19:42:54	keveloper	god dammit zec
2017-07-27 19:43:05	keveloper	$200
2017-07-27 19:43:24	na_th_an	what did you buy at
2017-07-27 19:43:31	keveloper	i dont remember

2017-07-27 19:43:44	na_th_an	lul
2017-07-31 09:40:42	keveloper	i dont think yash knows anything about conventions or best practices lol
2017-07-31 09:40:59	keveloper	#globalVariableOutsideARequireModule
2017-07-31 09:41:09	na_th_an	yeah I mean you can't expect him to 
2017-07-31 09:41:14	na_th_an	how would he know
2017-07-31 09:41:14	keveloper	why
2017-07-31 09:41:18	keveloper	idk i knew
2017-07-31 09:41:23	keveloper	and i learned stuff like that from school
2017-07-31 09:41:29	keveloper	things like dont use global variables
2017-07-31 09:41:34	na_th_an	well you don't learn that shit in most schools
2017-07-31 09:41:36	na_th_an	honestly
2017-07-31 09:41:40	keveloper	wat
2017-07-31 09:41:45	na_th_an	yeah dude
2017-07-31 09:41:50	na_th_an	osu doesn't teach software engineering
2017-07-31 09:41:51	na_th_an	at all
2017-07-31 09:41:53	na_th_an	it's cse
2017-07-31 09:41:55	keveloper	our profs were pretty good about teaching best practices
2017-07-31 09:42:01	na_th_an	ours were not
2017-07-31 09:42:12	na_th_an	and i'm sure the schools he's gone to were more cs than e
2017-07-31 09:42:15	keveloper	and about commenting "why" but writing code that can be understood without comments and stuff like that
2017-07-31 09:42:17	keveloper	and making short methods
2017-07-31 09:42:25	na_th_an	literally never covered at osu
2017-07-31 09:42:29	keveloper	thats so dumb
2017-07-31 09:42:35	keveloper	yeah apparently capital cs is pretty good lol
2017-07-31 09:42:42	keveloper	all because of dr. reed probably
2017-07-31 09:42:42	na_th_an	there are probably profs that'd say what patrick did about 300 line methods
2017-07-31 09:42:44	keveloper	that guys awesome
2017-07-31 09:42:48	keveloper	wtf
2017-07-31 09:42:57	keveloper	yeah dreed is all about clean code its cool
2017-07-31 09:43:09	na_th_an	yeah man acadamia is way out of touch with what the industry needs for software developers
2017-07-31 09:43:11	na_th_an	and they don't care
2017-07-31 09:43:18	na_th_an	because they're "pure" and about "computer science"
2017-07-31 09:43:20	keveloper	if you would write like a monolith method for a project you would literally get points of for it being hard to read and undocumented and stuff
2017-07-31 09:43:24	na_th_an	not software engineering
2017-07-31 09:43:35	na_th_an	if you did at osu and it worked it wouldn't matter
2017-07-31 09:43:54	na_th_an	but you also never get an opportunity to write something large enough for that to happen 
2017-07-31 09:43:54	keveloper	weird\
2017-07-31 09:44:11	keveloper	yeah i kind of brought that upon myself
2017-07-31 09:44:21	keveloper	for the more open projects that were like "build whatever you want in java"
2017-07-31 09:44:23	keveloper	and stuff like that
2017-07-31 09:44:43	keveloper	we had projects that were like "do whatever want in X language but you have to incorporate A B and C
2017-07-31 09:44:52	keveloper	that's where pernt came from
2017-07-31 09:44:54	keveloper	design patterns
2017-07-31 09:45:00	na_th_an	I wish I got that :(
2017-07-31 09:45:06	keveloper	there's a pretty cool strategy pattern for drawing types in there
2017-07-31 09:45:12	na_th_an	yeah we literally never talked about design patterns
2017-07-31 09:45:16	keveloper	:(
2017-07-31 09:45:25	keveloper	tbf that was in independent study that me and 6 people did
2017-07-31 09:45:29	keveloper	(including alex)
2017-07-31 09:45:56	na_th_an	I tried to do an independent study but couldn't find a prof to do it with
2017-07-31 09:46:23	keveloper	then databases they were again like "make whatever you want but you have to use more than x tables with at least on of each relationship and use z joins" or soemthing like that
2017-07-31 09:46:49	keveloper	so i made a social network in J2EE and mysql
2017-07-31 09:46:58	na_th_an	for db we were at least allowed to write whatever db schema we watned
2017-07-31 09:47:02	na_th_an	it had to my ms sql
2017-07-31 09:47:04	keveloper	lol
2017-07-31 09:47:10	keveloper	we could use any sql db we wanted
2017-07-31 09:47:20	keveloper	i think i used postgres actually
2017-07-31 09:47:20	na_th_an	I just duplicated the test automation database
2017-07-31 09:47:24	keveloper	lol
2017-07-31 09:47:26	na_th_an	then we had to write some queries for it
2017-07-31 09:47:30	keveloper	like literally any schema
2017-07-31 09:47:30	na_th_an	with joins and whatever
2017-07-31 09:47:32	na_th_an	yeah
2017-07-31 09:47:38	na_th_an	it had to have a certain number of like forign keys
2017-07-31 09:47:39	keveloper	you didn't have to have each type of relationship
2017-07-31 09:47:44	na_th_an	yeah that too
2017-07-31 09:47:47	keveloper	ah ok
2017-07-31 09:49:20	keveloper	agh
2017-07-31 09:49:34	keveloper	yash's class convetions
2017-07-31 09:49:37	keveloper	we should probably comment yes?
2017-07-31 09:50:04	keveloper	gosh he is all over the place
2017-07-31 09:50:12	keveloper	in IHaveNeverSeenThisCase
2017-07-31 09:50:13	keveloper	lol
2017-07-31 09:51:52	keveloper	we should adress these variable names right
2017-07-31 09:52:03	na_th_an	probably
2017-07-31 09:52:05	keveloper	err class and ids
2017-07-31 09:52:07	keveloper	i dont wanna
2017-07-31 09:52:08	keveloper	but
2017-07-31 09:52:17	na_th_an	you could ask bryan
2017-07-31 09:52:24	na_th_an	'do you think this is worth mentioning'
2017-07-31 09:52:36	keveloper	also failedAdditionID is how i wouldve written it a year ago but no i'd do failedAdditionId
2017-07-31 09:52:45	keveloper	wait what is this variable
2017-07-31 09:53:03	na_th_an	yeah Id is correct 
2017-07-31 09:53:10	na_th_an	for proper camel casing in java
2017-07-31 09:53:24	na_th_an	that's ~ ~ ~ C O N V E N T I O N ~ ~ ~
2017-07-31 09:53:31	keveloper	wait what
2017-07-31 09:53:45	keveloper	im confused what failedAdditionId is doing
2017-07-31 09:54:04	na_th_an	it gets the id number for the record that failed i think
2017-07-31 09:54:09	na_th_an	so it can re-press the button
2017-07-31 09:54:19	na_th_an	when you press the try again link
2017-07-31 09:54:25	keveloper	failedAdditionID = $iconContainer.attr("id");
2017-07-31 09:54:50	keveloper	what is $iconContainer
2017-07-31 09:55:09	na_th_an	good question
2017-07-31 09:55:39	na_th_an	it would have been way more productive to have someone pair with him for this
2017-07-31 09:55:41	na_th_an	oh well
2017-07-31 09:55:48	keveloper	$iconContainer is the parent of the literal icon
2017-07-31 09:56:08	keveloper	god this list thing is so gross
2017-07-31 09:56:54	keveloper	so
2017-07-31 09:56:54	keveloper	many
2017-07-31 09:56:55	keveloper	jquery
2017-07-31 09:56:56	keveloper	selectors
2017-07-31 09:57:21	na_th_an	:(
2017-07-31 09:57:48	keveloper	like i'd love to tell him "use kebab case for classes and ids" but then there's this right above what he did id="filter_button_results_control"
2017-07-31 09:57:54	keveloper	but tbf he didn't do snake either
2017-07-31 09:57:56	keveloper	he did like
2017-07-31 09:58:02	keveloper	CamelSnake
2017-07-31 09:58:08	keveloper	or PasbabCase
2017-07-31 10:06:07	na_th_an	it'd be nice if we actually had an official standard
2017-07-31 10:06:14	keveloper	yeah
2017-07-31 10:06:20	keveloper	i would write it lol
2017-07-31 10:06:26	keveloper	also we need better training
2017-07-31 10:06:28	keveloper	and pairing
2017-07-31 10:06:40	keveloper	someone should have paired with him for the entirety of t his ticket
2017-07-31 10:06:43	keveloper	wouldve helped me a great deal
2017-07-31 10:06:44	na_th_an	yeah
2017-07-31 10:06:49	keveloper	i mean when i started
2017-07-31 10:06:58	na_th_an	yup
2017-07-31 10:07:52	keveloper	im commenting abunch tho
2017-07-31 10:09:02	keveloper	is detailed-record-main angular
2017-07-31 10:09:15	keveloper	ya looks like it
2017-07-31 10:10:27	keveloper	he should probably use jquery selectors and listeners if the entire file is already ya
2017-07-31 10:10:39	na_th_an	ya that would be better
2017-07-31 10:10:44	keveloper	than having mixed
2017-07-31 10:10:47	keveloper	yeah
2017-07-31 10:11:08	na_th_an	I think jquery selectors would also fail silently if something doesn't exist which would fix one of his issues but in a kinda gross way so I didn't mention that as a possible fix
2017-07-31 10:12:12	keveloper	he's using a jquery listener like just below that lol
2017-07-31 10:12:25	keveloper	i wonder if he's in a "if it works" mode from school
2017-07-31 10:12:36	na_th_an	well sure bc he has no idea how to do any of this
2017-07-31 10:12:42	keveloper	true
2017-07-31 10:12:48	na_th_an	i had to explain to him that you can use an id in css selectors
2017-07-31 10:13:16	keveloper	oh  jk the router there is director
2017-07-31 10:18:39	keveloper	wait whered your comment go
2017-07-31 10:18:43	keveloper	about duplicate mark up
2017-07-31 10:19:12	na_th_an	it's still there
2017-07-31 10:21:12	keveloper	bitbucket wont show it
2017-07-31 10:21:18	keveloper	like i see the comment in the feed thing
2017-07-31 10:21:20	na_th_an	it's there in overview
2017-07-31 10:21:22	keveloper	but not in the changes

2017-07-31 13:58:31	keveloper	god ive done like nothing today
2017-07-31 13:58:45	na_th_an	I feel like I've done nothing but I've actually done a decent amount
2017-07-31 14:19:06	na_th_an	whenever kt is in irc I have to resist the urge to make coldplay jokes
2017-07-31 14:19:18	keveloper	llllllllol
2017-07-31 14:19:21	na_th_an	that's all I think about now
2017-07-31 14:20:23	na_th_an	i wonder where jay gets his hair cut
2017-07-31 16:10:40	na_th_an	this ticket ying submitted is all wrong
2017-07-31 16:10:44	na_th_an	almost everything in it is wrong
2017-07-31 16:10:53	keveloper	rly
2017-07-31 16:10:59	keveloper	lemme look
2017-07-31 16:11:02	na_th_an	it's right enough that middleware will know what to do
2017-07-31 16:11:03	na_th_an	but 
2017-07-31 16:11:10	na_th_an	it's not that we don't have permission, it's that it's disabled
2017-07-31 16:11:15	na_th_an	which I pointed out
2017-07-31 16:11:24	na_th_an	she didn't ask them to disable VDX like I suggested
2017-07-31 16:11:29	na_th_an	devcon has nothing to do with it
2017-07-31 16:11:37	keveloper	yeah where did devcon come from
2017-07-31 16:11:56	na_th_an	misunderstanding core concept
2017-07-31 16:22:11	keveloper	she couldnt believe it :o
2017-07-31 16:22:19	na_th_an	I also couldn't believe it.
2017-07-31 16:34:02	keveloper	what if freeways had variable speed limits\
2017-07-31 16:34:18	keveloper	and like all of the digital speed limit signs measure traffic speeds
2017-07-31 16:34:30	keveloper	so that at night it could be like 75mph
2017-07-31 16:34:41	keveloper	but during rush hour its like 55 or something idk
2017-07-31 16:34:49	na_th_an	they have that in germany
2017-07-31 16:34:51	na_th_an	on the autobahn
2017-07-31 16:34:57	na_th_an	when it rains the speed limit is lowered
2017-08-01 10:00:52	keveloper	idk why yash changed brief and detail js if those both already include my list so i asked if he could refactor it
2017-08-01 10:01:26	keveloper	also fidget spinners are here
2017-08-01 10:01:33	na_th_an	because my list is included on the my list page that doesn't have the save buttons
2017-08-01 10:01:44	na_th_an	so his document.getElemetnById was throwing an error
2017-08-01 10:01:51	keveloper	well he should be using jquery
2017-08-01 10:01:56	keveloper	or check if the element is there or something
2017-08-01 10:02:15	na_th_an	yeah but it's better if he just had its own module for this imo
2017-08-01 10:02:23	keveloper	because of all of the list logic should definitely be in my-list and not just threw it on detail and brief
2017-08-01 10:02:26	na_th_an	which I think is what I told him to do in the code review
2017-08-01 10:02:28	keveloper	and also look at detailed and brief
2017-08-01 10:02:31	keveloper	will that even work
2017-08-01 10:02:35	keveloper	he didn't use it
2017-08-01 10:02:42	keveloper	i've never used require without using extend
2017-08-01 10:02:47	keveloper	Base.extend or whatever
2017-08-01 10:02:51	keveloper	which returns a prototype
2017-08-01 10:03:25	keveloper	ah ok ya itll work cause he just put some functions in there
2017-08-01 10:03:27	keveloper	and listeners
2017-08-01 10:04:28	keveloper	emily might get new glasses woooo
2017-08-01 10:04:31	keveloper	v excite
2017-08-01 10:04:46	na_th_an	why is that v excite
2017-08-01 10:05:03	keveloper	new glasses are exciting
2017-08-01 10:05:07	keveloper	new look
2017-08-01 10:05:56	keveloper	anyway so ya this should be a new module using Base.extend
2017-08-01 10:06:24	na_th_an	I honestly don't really know what base.extend does but I always use it
2017-08-01 10:06:30	na_th_an	it's not something I've ever looked into
2017-08-01 10:06:32	keveloper	it returns a prototype basically
2017-08-01 10:07:35	keveloper	but yeah so you should be able to do new MyListErrorNotification
2017-08-01 10:07:42	keveloper	first of all i hate that he's calling it a dialog
2017-08-01 10:07:54	keveloper	cause its not really a dialog
2017-08-01 10:07:58	na_th_an	correct
2017-08-01 10:08:11	keveloper	dialog implies the user has to interact
2017-08-01 10:08:13	keveloper	and they dont
2017-08-01 10:08:21	keveloper	its a notification or an alert or something
2017-08-01 10:08:22	keveloper	w/e
2017-08-01 10:08:30	na_th_an	well it's not going to go away until they interact
2017-08-01 10:08:34	na_th_an	but I know what you mean
2017-08-01 10:08:38	keveloper	yeah i know that but
2017-08-01 10:08:57	keveloper	var errorNotif = new MyListErrorNotification()
2017-08-01 10:09:02	keveloper	errorNotif.show()
2017-08-01 10:09:04	keveloper	etc.
2017-08-01 10:09:07	keveloper	it needs an interface
2017-08-01 10:09:13	keveloper	all logic should be encapsulated in the module
2017-08-01 10:09:17	keveloper	/prototype
2017-08-01 10:09:29	keveloper	i dont want to further fuck up all of our js lol
2017-08-01 10:24:25	keveloper	i'd have $600 if i didn't trade alts
2017-08-01 10:24:26	keveloper	lol kms

2017-08-01 10:26:52	keveloper	then other times im like noooo
2017-08-01 10:27:01	keveloper	but most of the time its a "yay shes good"
2017-08-01 10:27:22	na_th_an	yeah I feel ya
2017-08-01 10:29:02	keveloper	did i tell  you about quinton having to stop the matrix to explain it to sarah
2017-08-01 10:29:19	na_th_an	yeah
2017-08-01 10:30:08	keveloper	that was great
2017-08-01 10:30:09	keveloper	great time
2017-08-01 10:30:20	na_th_an	that would have annoyed the shit out of me

2017-08-01 10:30:35	keveloper	it was funny to listen to
2017-08-01 10:30:49	na_th_an	i'd be annoyed by her stupidity
2017-08-01 10:31:05	keveloper	no i think she just doesn't pay attention
2017-08-01 10:31:11	keveloper	maybe she's stupid idk
2017-08-01 10:31:28	keveloper	i think she like pays attention to the visuals and doesnt listen to what people say idk
2017-08-01 10:31:30	keveloper	she's basically 7
2017-08-01 10:32:39	na_th_an	what does that say about quinton
2017-08-01 10:33:02	keveloper	i think he wonders what his life would be like if they broke up
2017-08-01 10:33:05	keveloper	but is afraid to do it
2017-08-01 10:33:05	keveloper	idk
2017-08-01 10:33:22	keveloper	i think he wanted to go to cali so he could break up with her
2017-08-01 10:33:24	keveloper	but idrk
2017-08-01 10:33:52	keveloper	on the other hand i already know what my life would be like without emily so im set lol \o/

2017-08-01 12:53:47	na_th_an	we spent a decent amount of time interviewing her and not interviewing anyone else because they were negotiating with her
2017-08-01 12:54:03	keveloper	wat

2017-08-01 12:54:12	keveloper	is there a reason she didn't take it
2017-08-01 12:54:21	na_th_an	I assume it's because we don't pay enough

2017-08-01 12:57:53	na_th_an	I have no idea what "be sure to track actuals" even means
2017-08-01 12:57:54	na_th_an	honestly

2017-08-01 13:01:07	keveloper	will she gets it a joke

2017-08-01 13:01:24	na_th_an	i wouldn't have to do this if we were using the static analysis tools jar rules
2017-08-01 13:01:35	na_th_an	but no we can't even get bryan to agree to let us move to that
2017-08-01 13:01:37	keveloper	so do it

2017-08-01 13:03:26	na_th_an	"I can't read anything on this screen"

2017-08-01 13:05:44	na_th_an	I'm going to make a comment on this PR about how stupid what I'm doing is but I have to because our codenarc rules say that's what's right
2017-08-01 13:05:49	na_th_an	this is so dumb
2017-08-01 13:08:25	keveloper	how many people on the team know what css specificity is
2017-08-01 13:08:32	na_th_an	yay I get to make change nows -_-

2017-08-01 13:15:43	na_th_an	"We would like to deploy to NAT just 2 days prior to the Prod deployment. For example, is Aug 10th for NAT and 14th for Prod doable?"
2017-08-01 13:15:49	na_th_an	isn't that 4 days
2017-08-01 13:16:29	na_th_an	also it's fun scheduling prod installs before product and ux have finished their tasks
2017-08-01 13:17:47	keveloper	lol
2017-08-01 13:50:33	keveloper	i feel like people on this team are bad at css
2017-08-01 13:50:41	na_th_an	for sure
2017-08-01 13:50:57	na_th_an	before you were on the team I was having trouble with some css stuff
2017-08-01 13:51:11	na_th_an	and I asked zach if anyone in EUS was good at CSS that I could ask a question to
2017-08-01 13:51:15	na_th_an	and he's like "no"
2017-08-01 13:51:18	na_th_an	literally he said no
2017-08-01 13:51:43	keveloper	lol what
2017-08-01 13:51:47	keveloper	isn't zach deceent at css
2017-08-01 13:51:56	na_th_an	yeah he's fine 
2017-08-01 13:51:59	na_th_an	but he couldn't answer my question
2017-08-01 13:51:59	keveloper	the only reason im really good at it now is freelancing and #css
2017-08-01 13:52:11	na_th_an	and I'm like "is there anyone around that's really good at css"
2017-08-01 13:52:14	na_th_an	and he's like "no not really"
2017-08-01 13:52:26	keveloper	and i've made a bunch of pages and things in pure css from scratch without googling now
2017-08-01 13:52:30	keveloper	well times a changin
2017-08-01 13:52:37	keveloper	i like to think im 'really good at css'
2017-08-01 13:52:42	keveloper	way better than the average dev at least
2017-08-01 13:52:54	na_th_an	for sure
2017-08-01 13:52:56	keveloper	i remember when i had to google to do literally anything
2017-08-01 13:53:02	na_th_an	me irl
2017-08-01 13:53:11	keveloper	it was annoying
2017-08-01 13:53:22	keveloper	i can make an entire landing page wihtout googling now \o/
2017-08-01 13:53:36	keveloper	except for media queries i always forget the exact syntax
2017-08-01 13:54:07	keveloper	also i learned a trick for a slightly transparent color over an image i've never seen before last week
2017-08-01 13:54:18	keveloper	its pretty snazzy and i think its not that hacky because it makes sense
2017-08-01 13:56:51	keveloper	k so i got this right https://codepen.io/kholland950/pen/wqWKqm
2017-08-01 13:57:25	keveloper	https://codepen.io/kholland950/pen/wqWKqm
2017-08-01 13:57:27	keveloper	now look at line 11
2017-08-01 13:57:37	na_th_an	ok
2017-08-01 13:57:45	keveloper	isn't that cool
2017-08-01 13:57:52	keveloper	i think that makes perfect sense too
2017-08-01 13:57:58	na_th_an	all I see is an image
2017-08-01 13:57:59	keveloper	like its prety intuitive just being a big inset shadow
2017-08-01 13:58:02	keveloper	right but its darker
2017-08-01 13:58:16	na_th_an	idk how I was supposed to know that jeez
2017-08-01 13:58:21	keveloper	k refresh i made it blatently obvious
2017-08-01 13:59:18	keveloper	isn't that neat tho
2017-08-01 13:59:23	na_th_an	I've seen forests that look like that
2017-08-01 13:59:25	na_th_an	but ya p cool
2017-08-01 13:59:38	keveloper	normally its a hacky gross div or a ::before or something dumb
2017-08-01 13:59:44	keveloper	but this is one line
2017-08-01 13:59:47	keveloper	and it makes sense
2017-08-01 14:00:33	keveloper	and it works on every browser
2017-08-01 14:00:37	keveloper	inset shadows have been a thing forever
2017-08-01 14:01:24	na_th_an	did you actually review this wiremock shit
2017-08-01 14:01:47	keveloper	i looked at the prop file which i think was copy and pasted he jsut added the file
2017-08-01 14:01:51	keveloper	or the whole thing?
2017-08-01 14:01:53	keveloper	i glanced over each file
2017-08-01 14:01:56	keveloper	but i mean not _reall_

2017-08-09 13:24:57	na_th_an	damn

2017-08-09 13:26:41	na_th_an	btw rashmi said they aren't rolling out any more monitors until january
2017-08-09 13:26:58	na_th_an	so in january they'll probably give HR and sales new monitors
2017-08-09 13:27:00	keveloper	lol #shocker
2017-08-09 13:27:07	na_th_an	then maybe by this time next year if we're still employed here we'll get new monitors
2017-08-09 13:28:26	keveloper	lol i kinda doubt it
2017-08-09 13:29:27	keveloper	i want like $1k of new music stuff lol

2017-08-09 14:47:20	na_th_an	buy one
2017-08-09 14:48:27	keveloper	kinda want a yoga
2017-08-09 14:49:17	na_th_an	lenovo is kinda bad but not the absolute worst
2017-08-09 14:49:29	keveloper	what would you recommend
2017-08-09 14:49:31	keveloper	emily's yoga is nice
2017-08-09 14:49:35	na_th_an	if you do I highly recommend wiping the hdd and installing a fresh copy of windows
2017-08-09 14:49:42	keveloper	oh well ya
2017-08-09 14:49:52	keveloper	i'd need linux for dev anyway
2017-08-09 14:49:54	na_th_an	lenovo has bundled rootkits before 
2017-08-09 14:50:26	na_th_an	it kinda depends on what you want
2017-08-09 14:51:25	keveloper	dev/browse internet/maybe rocket league lol
2017-08-09 14:51:47	keveloper	so like i7/8gb ram/512+ SSD or something
2017-08-09 14:52:14	na_th_an	you definitely want more than 8gb of ram probably 
2017-08-09 14:52:16	na_th_an	ram is cheap
2017-08-09 14:52:22	na_th_an	my zenbook is pretty good
2017-08-09 14:52:24	keveloper	idk if i even need an i7
2017-08-09 14:52:28	na_th_an	you probably don't
2017-08-09 14:52:48	na_th_an	but because of advertising and stupidity most of the laptops with other good features are going to have an i7
2017-08-09 14:52:59	keveloper	i5 / 16gb ram / 512+ SSD then i guess
2017-08-09 14:53:03	keveloper	ucb-c
2017-08-09 14:53:10	keveloper	usb-c charging maybe???????
2017-08-09 14:53:13	na_th_an	usb-c will limit you
2017-08-09 14:53:16	na_th_an	that's still pretty rare

2017-08-09 14:56:15	keveloper	what size is your zenbook
2017-08-09 14:56:23	na_th_an	13"
2017-08-09 14:56:28	keveloper	is it big enough
2017-08-09 14:57:20	na_th_an	i think so
2017-08-09 14:57:33	na_th_an	it's a 3600x1800 screen so the dpi is really good
2017-08-09 14:57:36	na_th_an	so you can scale 
2017-08-09 14:57:58	keveloper	http://www.microcenter.com/product/480984/Pavilion_15-cc059nr_156_Laptop_Computer_-_Silver

2017-08-09 15:09:56	keveloper	do you ever use a desktop with arch
2017-08-09 15:09:58	keveloper	like a gui based desktop

2017-08-09 15:10:41	na_th_an	all the time
2017-08-09 15:10:53	keveloper	ah okay
2017-08-09 15:10:57	keveloper	its just KDE right
2017-08-09 15:11:17	na_th_an	i use kde
2017-08-09 15:11:21	na_th_an	you can use whatever you want tho
2017-08-09 15:11:26	keveloper	then you can get a theme for kde
2017-08-09 15:11:46	na_th_an	or gnome
2017-08-09 15:12:00	na_th_an	I've heard decent things about gnome recently but I don't really care
2017-08-09 15:12:03	na_th_an	i <3 kde
2017-08-09 15:12:12	keveloper	what is plasma
2017-08-09 15:12:17	keveloper	"plasma themes"
2017-08-09 15:12:20	keveloper	some kde thing
2017-08-09 15:12:20	na_th_an	plasma is kde5 basically
2017-08-09 15:12:30	keveloper	is that the newest one
2017-08-09 15:12:33	na_th_an	kde is 'k desktop environment' 
2017-08-09 15:12:35	na_th_an	yeah
2017-08-09 15:12:49	na_th_an	they wanted to disambiguate the whole desktop environment from the WM/shell
2017-08-09 15:13:01	keveloper	wm
2017-08-09 15:13:10	na_th_an	window manager
2017-08-09 15:13:13	keveloper	oh ok
2017-08-09 15:14:35	keveloper	so a kde theme would not change the appearnace of windows?
2017-08-09 15:14:58	na_th_an	idk I think it would? 
2017-08-09 15:15:12	na_th_an	i haven't messed with themes in a little while but it's really easy to do 
2017-08-09 15:15:20	keveloper	isn't a window manager the thing that controls to appearnce of windows
2017-08-09 15:15:39	na_th_an	yes
2017-08-09 15:15:42	na_th_an	which is kwin/plasma
2017-08-09 15:15:51	keveloper	oh
2017-08-09 15:15:52	na_th_an	kde is a whole desktop environment which includes a window manager
2017-08-09 15:16:02	keveloper	ohhh ok
2017-08-09 15:16:41	keveloper	doo you know what a look and feel pack is
2017-08-09 15:17:35	na_th_an	sounds like a theme

2017-08-09 15:17:47	keveloper	idk there a themes and look and feel packs
2017-08-09 15:17:56	na_th_an	idk
2017-08-09 15:19:40	keveloper	so why do people make material design OS's off of arch instead of just making a kde theme or whatever
2017-08-09 15:19:46	keveloper	like papyros
2017-08-09 15:19:55	keveloper	why isn't it just arch, and a kde theme called papyros
2017-08-09 15:20:56	keveloper	this is cool https://store.kde.org/content/show.php/Hex?content=164147
2017-08-09 15:21:00	na_th_an	because they want to include applications + themes

2017-08-14 13:12:50	keveloper	"Transactions per second remained normal throughout the rest of the day. No abnormal patterns in requests."

2017-08-15 11:01:18	na_th_an	as I tested stuff
2017-08-15 11:02:00	keveloper	was it hard
2017-08-15 11:02:04	keveloper	idk how to review this
2017-08-15 11:02:40	na_th_an	it was sorta hard 
2017-08-15 11:02:48	na_th_an	I've never used hystrix before and idk if I'm really doing it right
2017-08-15 11:02:50	na_th_an	but it works
2017-08-15 11:03:25	keveloper	so this means dui will work when the session service is down
2017-08-15 11:03:28	na_th_an	yeah
2017-08-15 11:03:32	keveloper	does that ever happen
2017-08-15 11:03:40	na_th_an	it'll fall back to a host-local session map if the hazelcast connection ever fails
2017-08-15 11:03:43	na_th_an	idk

2017-08-15 12:57:42	keveloper	bill was like "these are not the updates we are looking for" about the incident
2017-08-15 12:57:45	keveloper	he was like
2017-08-15 12:57:54	keveloper	"looking for more of a bulleted list"
2017-08-15 12:58:07	keveloper	I was like "i mean i can throw dashes in front of some of these sentences if that's what you want"

2017-08-15 13:00:00	na_th_an	unless oclc is doing something extremely wrong you won't have trouble finding another position
2017-08-15 13:00:30	keveloper	bill was happy with my pretty much copy and pasting and putting dashes in front of the sentence ok
2017-08-15 14:25:39	na_th_an	ying having git issues
2017-08-15 14:26:01	na_th_an	she just messaged me that her local build is failing because it doesn't have a stickyFacetsChecked property in searchquery.java
2017-08-15 14:26:08	keveloper	lol what

2017-08-15 15:19:54	keveloper	no way in hell that comprehension is more reabable than find in groovy lol
2017-08-15 15:20:16	na_th_an	tbh i think they're about the same
2017-08-15 15:20:48	keveloper	they aren't that different as far as readability but the groovy one is definitely a little better
2017-08-15 15:21:19	na_th_an	yo
2017-08-15 15:21:31	na_th_an	you might feel differently if you worked with list comprehension on a regular bases
2017-08-15 15:21:32	na_th_an	basis
2017-08-15 15:22:41	keveloper	i used to use list comprehension all the time in pyhton
2017-08-15 15:22:44	keveloper	python
2017-08-15 15:23:00	na_th_an	:o
2017-08-15 15:23:01	keveloper	idk one of them says exactly what you are doing and one of them you have to parse in your brain
2017-08-15 15:23:16	keveloper	arr.find vs a for loop with an if
2017-08-15 15:31:22	keveloper	Hugh Jamieson
2017-08-15 15:31:33	keveloper	that name is close to one of those joke names

2017-08-16 09:31:36	na_th_an	oh
2017-08-16 09:31:42	na_th_an	I thought you were going to tell a story
2017-08-16 09:48:45	na_th_an	"the lbirary was adding omre IP ranges to their server"
2017-08-16 09:48:47	na_th_an	wut

2017-08-16 09:49:38	keveloper	its
2017-08-16 09:49:42	keveloper	a traffic issue right
2017-08-16 09:49:46	keveloper	...
2017-08-16 09:49:53	na_th_an	what does "adding more IP ranges" even mean
2017-08-16 09:49:58	na_th_an	unless there was a whitelist
2017-08-16 09:50:01	na_th_an	and they're expanding it
2017-08-16 09:50:04	keveloper	im assuming whitelist
2017-08-16 09:50:06	na_th_an	which makes no sense 
2017-08-16 09:50:09	keveloper	but that has nothing to do with this
2017-08-16 09:50:11	na_th_an	yeah
2017-08-16 09:50:24	na_th_an	either they're doing something wrong or csd is communicating poorly
2017-08-16 09:53:49	na_th_an	i like how bill literally copy and pasted what you said
2017-08-16 09:54:41	keveloper	lol i messaged jen
2017-08-16 09:55:02	keveloper	'This seems to be a traffic/load related issue right? With the 'too many clients attached' and the quadrupled traffic?'
2017-08-16 09:55:07	keveloper	"Yes, that's what it looks like to me. I think we have a few things at play though."
2017-08-16 09:55:11	keveloper	"1. Library doesn't speak English - only Spanish."
2017-08-16 09:55:15	keveloper	"2. I don't speak Spanish, so I'm working with our support rep in Mexico who in turn is working with them."
2017-08-16 09:55:22	keveloper	"3. I'm not sure she's grasping all the technicalities and how much of that is technical understanding and how much is language barrier."
2017-08-16 09:55:45	na_th_an	sigh
2017-08-16 11:00:54	na_th_an	I'm really tired of our code review process being broken 
2017-08-16 11:01:09	na_th_an	let's make tech leads approve everything but make them too busy to do any code reviews
2017-08-16 12:32:48	keveloper	lollll

2017-08-16 13:19:04	na_th_an	it needs tech lead approval

2017-08-16 13:19:29	keveloper	We should use this chunked transfer encoding thing
2017-08-16 13:20:13	na_th_an	i have no idea how saved searh is building on the build server
2017-08-16 13:20:15	na_th_an	something is fucked up
2017-08-16 13:22:24	keveloper	it looks like chunked transfer encoding is on by default in jetty? I don't see the header though
2017-08-16 13:27:30	na_th_an	-------------------------------------------_-------------------------------------------
2017-08-16 13:27:34	na_th_an	okay so

2017-08-16 13:27:45	na_th_an	on saved search
2017-08-16 13:28:05	na_th_an	the build will have failed locally for over 2 months now
2017-08-16 13:28:14	na_th_an	because the publish task didn't include coverage
2017-08-16 13:28:19	na_th_an	so a clean build won't work locally
2017-08-16 13:28:29	na_th_an	but clean publish does
2017-08-16 13:31:44	keveloper	oooooooooooooh

2017-08-21 10:41:39	na_th_an	<span translate="saved_searches_list.cluster_results.{{savedSearch.clusterResults}}"></span>
2017-08-21 10:41:46	na_th_an	then it'll look up the translation key based on if the value is true or false
2017-08-21 10:42:19	keveloper	wait what
2017-08-21 10:42:37	na_th_an	{{}} is angular templating

2017-08-21 10:43:27	keveloper	why would ever not want to look up the translation
2017-08-21 10:43:47	na_th_an	wut
2017-08-21 10:43:52	keveloper	im confused
2017-08-21 10:44:03	na_th_an	clusterResults is true or false
2017-08-21 10:44:18	na_th_an	so that span will be either the true or false translation
2017-08-21 10:44:26	na_th_an	p simple
2017-08-21 10:44:43	keveloper	oh

2017-08-21 10:44:52	keveloper	i didn't get what the message was
2017-08-21 10:45:01	na_th_an	the message is "on" or "off"
2017-08-21 10:45:01	keveloper	I thought it was like conditionally translating some phrase idk
2017-08-21 10:45:03	keveloper	yeah ok

2017-08-21 10:50:01	na_th_an	it's somewhat common

2017-08-21 10:53:44	na_th_an	he totally fucked over the middle east
2017-08-21 10:54:09	keveloper	yeah that's probably good
2017-08-21 10:54:13	keveloper	do they learn about hitler or

2017-08-21 10:54:35	na_th_an	or learned very little

2017-08-21 10:56:00	na_th_an	idk about syria
2017-08-21 10:56:06	na_th_an	i'm not a history buff

2017-08-21 10:57:06	na_th_an	switzerland stayed out of both world wars but funded both sides
2017-08-21 10:57:11	na_th_an	they avoided war while making lots of money

2017-08-21 10:57:36	keveloper	so like nobody ever bombed or marched through switzerland
2017-08-21 10:57:39	keveloper	it was not a war zone
2017-08-21 10:57:58	keveloper	in other news dunkirk was awesome
2017-08-21 10:58:08	na_th_an	there's not much of a reason to march through it because it's basically all mountains
2017-08-21 10:58:13	keveloper	lol
2017-08-21 10:58:24	na_th_an	they used to have every mountain pass rigged with bombs
2017-08-21 10:58:29	na_th_an	so if they were being invaded they could blow them up
2017-08-21 10:58:33	na_th_an	and close themselves off
2017-08-21 10:58:41	keveloper	how the fuck did germany do all this
2017-08-21 10:58:42	na_th_an	every citizen in switzerland has to serve in the army

2017-08-21 11:08:33	na_th_an	with saved search we have a domain module
2017-08-21 11:08:42	na_th_an	when you do a snapshot it publishes both the application and the domain

2017-08-21 17:11:43	keveloper	i am confuzz
2017-08-21 17:11:58	keveloper	parsedQuery.replace(toRemove, '')
2017-08-21 17:12:05	keveloper	toRemove  was 'ca:123 456 '
2017-08-21 17:12:18	keveloper	parsedQuery was 'ca:123 456 au:smith AND WOO'
2017-08-21 17:12:24	keveloper	it was not removed
2017-08-21 17:12:50	na_th_an	replaceAll?
2017-08-21 17:13:05	na_th_an	is it expecting regex or something
2017-08-21 17:13:39	keveloper	oh duh
2017-08-21 17:13:40	keveloper	no
2017-08-21 17:13:52	keveloper	 parsedQuery = parsedQuery.replace(toRemove, '')
2017-08-21 17:13:57	na_th_an	lol
2017-08-21 17:14:05	keveloper	i always forget replace doesn't manipulate
2017-08-21 17:14:15	na_th_an	i had another "why the fuck is this null? oh the method is returning void" moment recently
2017-08-21 17:14:21	keveloper	lolll
2017-08-21 17:14:28	keveloper	i didn't return the parsed query
2017-08-21 17:14:33	keveloper	so it was returning the value of .each
2017-08-21 17:14:52	keveloper	and so it looked like the parsed query was ['ca','x0',...] i.e. the list of ignored indexes
2017-08-21 17:14:55	keveloper	and i was like WHAT!?!?!?!?
2017-08-21 17:16:29	keveloper	would it be stupid to do
2017-08-21 17:16:30	keveloper	.replaceAll(~/\w+/, ' ')
2017-08-21 17:16:38	keveloper	because i ahve abunch of 'the     query   blah'
2017-08-21 17:16:43	keveloper	from the manipulation
2017-08-21 17:16:48	na_th_an	idk ask product?
2017-08-21 17:16:53	keveloper	they dont gaf
2017-08-21 17:16:58	na_th_an	then sure do it
2017-08-21 17:17:00	na_th_an	idgaf
2017-08-21 17:17:38	keveloper	should maybe use the right regex though i just destroyed the entire query with w lol
2017-08-21 17:17:43	keveloper	"   '   "
2017-08-21 17:17:47	keveloper	hm that doesn't look right
2017-08-21 17:17:58	keveloper	\w != white space
2017-08-21 17:18:49	keveloper	from the design thing: Remove indexes (FINAL):                smith don't pinch ME
2017-08-21 17:19:00	keveloper	http://solrap-m1.dev.oclc.org/bridge/spelling/en/smith%20don't%20pinch%20ME

2017-08-21 17:22:48	na_th_an	so then what is solr supposed to return
2017-08-21 17:22:58	na_th_an	pairs of words and corrections?
2017-08-21 17:22:59	keveloper	a map of source to suggestion of what is spelled wrong
2017-08-21 17:23:12	keveloper	{ "dog":"doog" }
2017-08-21 17:23:12	keveloper	etc.
2017-08-21 17:23:20	na_th_an	wouldn't it be the other way around
2017-08-21 17:23:23	keveloper	yeah
2017-08-21 17:23:28	keveloper	but i was doing it based on my query lol
2017-08-21 17:23:30	na_th_an	i mean it doesn't matter
2017-08-21 17:23:32	keveloper	ya
2017-08-21 17:23:39	na_th_an	i'd think doog:dog makes more sense tho
2017-08-21 17:23:47	na_th_an	ok bye I'm out
2017-08-22 09:06:48	na_th_an	if you were to redo the facet and record widths on the brief results page what's the correct way to do it?
2017-08-22 09:06:59	na_th_an	use flexbox and set a minimum width on the facets?
2017-08-22 09:11:34	na_th_an	yea?
2017-08-22 09:12:10	keveloper	the record widths?
2017-08-22 09:12:29	na_th_an	ya the facet panel and record area
2017-08-22 09:12:34	na_th_an	how we looked at it and they use %s
2017-08-22 09:12:41	na_th_an	and you're like "that's so bad"
2017-08-22 09:12:44	na_th_an	what is correct
2017-08-22 09:12:54	keveloper	mainly shit like 98%
2017-08-22 09:13:02	keveloper	use 100% with a margin and box-sizing: border-box
2017-08-22 09:13:08	na_th_an	true ya
2017-08-22 09:13:12	keveloper	but also random shit like 68%
2017-08-22 09:13:14	keveloper	like wtf is that number
2017-08-22 09:13:36	keveloper	our media query for changing to the mobile view is way too low imo
2017-08-22 09:13:45	keveloper	dui is hardly usable at half width
2017-08-22 09:13:49	keveloper	and it is still in desktop mode
2017-08-22 09:14:31	na_th_an	the smartphone breakpoint is 640px on this screen which seems right
2017-08-22 09:17:53	keveloper	this is pretty bad http://imgur.com/a/P4FJg
2017-08-22 09:18:14	keveloper	that's right for a smartphone breakpoint but this view probably doesn't even fit well on a tablet
2017-08-22 09:18:44	na_th_an	i don't think that's THAT bad
2017-08-22 09:19:41	na_th_an	I've seen many, many worse sites
2017-08-22 09:19:59	keveloper	ya because that's how I want to determine the success of our app lol
2017-08-22 09:20:00	na_th_an	what really drives me nuts is websites that are for coding documentation/tutorial
2017-08-22 09:20:02	keveloper	"well it could be worse"
2017-08-22 09:20:13	na_th_an	and the margins are huge on every side
2017-08-22 09:20:15	keveloper	there's really shitty sites about css and its funny
2017-08-22 09:20:22	na_th_an	and you have to horizontally scroll 
2017-08-22 09:20:35	na_th_an	like this
2017-08-22 09:20:37	na_th_an	this is the worst
2017-08-22 09:20:42	na_th_an	the worst code documentation ever
2017-08-22 09:20:45	na_th_an	http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/
2017-08-22 09:20:56	na_th_an	so much wasted space
2017-08-22 09:20:57	keveloper	wtf
2017-08-22 09:21:02	na_th_an	and you have to horizontally scroll to read the code
2017-08-22 09:21:06	na_th_an	i fucking hate it

2017-08-22 09:28:03	na_th_an	all the social traffic that used to be in #mechboards is gone
2017-08-22 09:28:03	keveloper	i mean we took all of the off topic shit elsewhere tho
2017-08-22 09:28:10	keveloper	yeah that was kinda the point
2017-08-22 09:29:32	keveloper	im spinning my xyience on my fidget spinner its dope

2017-08-22 09:31:19	keveloper	i just realized that's too different people talking
2017-08-22 09:31:23	keveloper	they are the same color for me
2017-08-22 09:32:10	na_th_an	whoa

2017-08-22 09:32:43	keveloper	or recolor somebody
2017-08-22 09:32:43	na_th_an	idk
2017-08-22 09:34:13	keveloper	so i should have like
2017-08-22 09:34:24	keveloper	a SpellingSuggestionQueryParser
2017-08-22 09:34:29	keveloper	that has a static method
2017-08-22 09:34:35	keveloper	anddd thats it?
2017-08-22 09:34:35	keveloper	idk
2017-08-22 09:35:02	na_th_an	sure
2017-08-22 09:35:04	na_th_an	sounds fine to me
2017-08-22 09:35:09	keveloper	that's kinda dumb
2017-08-22 09:36:07	na_th_an	why
2017-08-22 09:36:11	keveloper	oh it probably can't be static because the ignored indexes are prolly gonna be a bean
2017-08-22 09:36:13	keveloper	but thats okasy
2017-08-22 09:36:14	keveloper	okay*
2017-08-22 09:36:20	na_th_an	ya
2017-08-22 09:36:28	keveloper	how do you think i should store a list of a bunch of 2 char strings
2017-08-22 09:37:05	na_th_an	List<String> ?
2017-08-22 09:37:23	keveloper	I mean do you think it should be in an xml file as a bean somewhere or just put it in the class
2017-08-22 09:37:36	keveloper	its all of these https://jira.oclc.org/browse/DA-23402
2017-08-22 09:39:32	na_th_an	beans should be as small as makes sense
2017-08-22 09:39:37	na_th_an	separation of concerns
2017-08-22 09:39:39	na_th_an	do one thing
2017-08-22 09:39:41	na_th_an	 etc
2017-08-22 09:40:02	keveloper	"hey guys welcome to the shittier version of the anime channel that like half of the users here came from."
2017-08-22 09:40:06	keveloper	the history is a little off lol
2017-08-22 09:41:07	na_th_an	a little off?
2017-08-22 09:41:18	keveloper	beyblades came from mechbaords
2017-08-22 09:41:19	na_th_an	rashmi and joe are over here talking about the parity party thing
2017-08-22 09:41:25	na_th_an	oh yeah
2017-08-22 09:41:29	na_th_an	I thought you meant the irc history
2017-08-22 09:41:31	na_th_an	and I was like "huh"
2017-08-22 09:41:37	keveloper	oh no i meant he is wrong lol
2017-08-22 09:41:41	na_th_an	ya
2017-08-22 09:41:46	na_th_an	they might be talking about pins
2017-08-22 09:41:49	na_th_an	it's either pins or bowling
2017-08-22 09:41:55	keveloper	i think they are doing bowling
2017-08-22 09:41:58	keveloper	rashmi asked about it last night
2017-08-22 09:42:03	keveloper	because oclc is paying for all of the drinks
2017-08-22 09:42:12	keveloper	and pins drinks are yanno downtown bar price so
2017-08-22 09:42:36	keveloper	anyway how should i store this list of a bunch of strings what do you think
2017-08-22 09:42:58	na_th_an	why wouldn't you
2017-08-22 09:43:07	keveloper	what
2017-08-22 09:43:11	keveloper	wouldn't i what
2017-08-22 09:43:25	na_th_an	the proposed solution to the problem you just mentioned
2017-08-22 09:43:29	na_th_an	you asked me before
2017-08-22 09:43:34	na_th_an	I said a list of strings
2017-08-22 09:43:34	keveloper	bean?
2017-08-22 09:43:43	na_th_an	sure
2017-08-22 09:43:46	keveloper	or you mean literally just in the class
2017-08-22 09:43:54	na_th_an	I thought you meant what datatype
2017-08-22 09:44:02	na_th_an	upload to pastebin and make an http request for it
2017-08-22 09:44:27	keveloper	oh ok
2017-08-22 10:01:56	keveloper	im not going to that anymore
2017-08-22 10:02:04	keveloper	im going to sit here until someone says my name
2017-08-22 10:02:08	keveloper	what a fucking waste of time
2017-08-22 10:02:13	na_th_an	yup
2017-08-22 10:02:21	keveloper	like wtf
2017-08-22 10:02:26	keveloper	i literally just said "what the board says" lol
2017-08-22 10:02:27	na_th_an	literally stood there for 17 minutes to say "yup I'm working on it"
2017-08-22 10:02:31	keveloper	ya
2017-08-22 10:02:36	keveloper	which the board already says
2017-08-22 10:02:38	keveloper	wtf is the point of that meeting
2017-08-22 10:03:01	na_th_an	very few developers on the team bother to keep their JIRAs up to date so we have that meeting
2017-08-22 10:03:11	na_th_an	I told rashmi that we should define what developers are supposed to do so it's clear
2017-08-22 10:03:13	na_th_an	like
2017-08-22 10:03:15	na_th_an	write down our process
2017-08-22 10:03:19	na_th_an	and she's like "I don't think that'd help"
2017-08-22 10:03:31	keveloper	we probably need more checklists
2017-08-22 10:03:39	keveloper	ANYWAY
2017-08-22 10:03:44	na_th_an	we literally have none of our process defined and it makes me mad
2017-08-22 10:03:53	keveloper	would it be awful to define the list of strings directly in the class
2017-08-22 10:04:00	keveloper	i dont see the benefit of a bea
2017-08-22 10:04:00	keveloper	n
2017-08-22 10:04:20	na_th_an	testability
2017-08-22 10:04:29	na_th_an	if you define it in the bean then when you test you inject fake data
2017-08-22 10:06:22	keveloper	or i can just test using the same list
2017-08-22 10:06:24	keveloper	but i guess so
2017-08-22 10:06:56	na_th_an	you can but it's better to separate the logic from the data
2017-08-22 10:09:11	na_th_an	I hate the way managers phrase things
2017-08-22 10:09:17	na_th_an	"Who can confirm everything is ready in NIT?"
2017-08-22 10:09:22	na_th_an	answer: Any developer
2017-08-22 10:09:47	na_th_an	What you mean is "Can someone please confirm everything is in NIT" 
2017-08-22 10:09:56	na_th_an	but you feel like you shouldn't tell people what to do? idk
2017-08-22 10:10:19	na_th_an	i also enjoyed rashmi explaining the automated test process
2017-08-22 10:10:41	na_th_an	she told QA to run the tests, see which ones fail, and determine if it's an environmental or data issue
2017-08-22 10:10:43	na_th_an	like
2017-08-22 10:10:45	na_th_an	duh
2017-08-22 10:24:19	na_th_an	rashmi just asked what questions we asked brendon 
2017-08-22 10:24:21	na_th_an	idfk
2017-08-22 10:28:58	keveloper	lol
2017-08-22 10:34:24	keveloper	https://0bin.net/paste/UMW7PR7y97U8xLuW#5hh0uq7rY5PUDPBq2ggiDuTxS7nGU8zWJpoIMmS2Fk1
2017-08-22 10:34:28	keveloper	i did this by hand lol
2017-08-22 10:35:10	na_th_an	not that bad with the right keyboard shortcuts
2017-08-22 10:35:27	keveloper	except for the part where i had to look up every index to see if it was : = or both
2017-08-22 10:35:33	na_th_an	lul
2017-08-22 10:37:11	keveloper	oh shoot

2017-08-22 10:37:51	keveloper	and stuff
2017-08-22 10:38:18	keveloper	should I put a space at the beginnig of the query and then a space at the beginning of the value in this list
2017-08-22 10:58:46	keveloper	woooo the startup im making this landing page for wants a link to my portfolio in the footer \o/

2017-08-22 11:03:30	keveloper	 @RequestParam(value = 'locale', required = false) final Locale locale
2017-08-22 11:04:26	keveloper	omg i looked over towards you and gary shurgin was staring at me in thought i hated it

2017-08-22 11:07:08	keveloper	good job binaebi

2017-08-22 11:08:05	na_th_an	it's just a hilarious word
2017-08-22 11:08:09	keveloper	who thought of that word
2017-08-22 11:08:18	na_th_an	idk plato probably
2017-08-22 11:09:11	keveloper	'ayy girl imma dip that thong in gold for you so you be looking sexy af...... dip that thong.... dipthong thats it!'
2017-08-22 11:09:16	keveloper	is probably how he thought of it
2017-08-22 11:10:04	na_th_an	then he smashed
2017-08-22 11:10:09	na_th_an	he smashed her right in the dipthong
2017-08-22 11:10:45	keveloper	i wonder if that would turn on a linguistics major
2017-08-22 11:11:04	na_th_an	does good css turn you on?
2017-08-22 11:11:07	na_th_an	actually, don't answer that

2017-08-22 11:12:22	keveloper	no but i'd probably find a cute girl who is really good at web dev more attractive than the same girl if she was bad at webdev

2017-08-22 13:20:41	na_th_an	if that tells you anything
2017-08-22 13:21:05	na_th_an	haley went to her family's christmas thing last year and specifically said that he wasn't allowed to talk about politics at all
2017-08-22 13:21:11	na_th_an	and she got up and used the bathroom
2017-08-22 13:21:22	na_th_an	and as soon as she did he made a comment about "it feels good to be on the winning team"
2017-08-22 13:21:52	na_th_an	he previously told haley that if he made more money he'd actually make less because he'd be in a new tax bracket
2017-08-22 13:21:53	keveloper	ugh
2017-08-22 13:22:05	na_th_an	showing that he knows absolutely nothing about tax brackets because only the income in that bracket is taxed at that rate
2017-08-22 13:22:11	keveloper	thats how tax brackets work
2017-08-22 13:22:22	na_th_an	so he's either ignorant while thinking he's the smartest guy ever or willfully lying to his daughter
2017-08-22 13:22:43	na_th_an	he also was a dick when she was a kid in a lot of ways
2017-08-22 13:22:47	na_th_an	idk i just have a very low opinion of him

2017-08-22 15:11:13	na_th_an	idk ask product i'm not involved in this
2017-08-22 15:11:26	keveloper	or should DUI ask for spellingSuggestions but it just wont call solr
2017-08-22 15:11:32	keveloper	why would i asked product that makes no sense
2017-08-22 15:11:43	na_th_an	ask a tech lead idk
2017-08-22 15:15:36	keveloper	i'm second guessing this design now
2017-08-22 15:15:53	na_th_an	wut
2017-08-22 15:15:58	keveloper	ok so
2017-08-22 15:16:03	keveloper	if someone search no:123
2017-08-22 15:16:05	keveloper	DUI would call
2017-08-22 15:16:15	keveloper	.../discovery-services/spellingSuggestion?query=no:123&locale=en_us
2017-08-22 15:16:28	keveloper	and DS would not make the call to SOLR and return {}
2017-08-22 15:16:40	na_th_an	ok
2017-08-22 15:16:47	keveloper	But that's an extra request to DR every search
2017-08-22 15:16:55	na_th_an	to DS you mean?
2017-08-22 15:16:57	keveloper	which isn't much diffferent than what was happening except for overhead
2017-08-22 15:16:58	keveloper	yes
2017-08-22 15:16:58	keveloper	DS
2017-08-22 15:17:16	keveloper	so should DUI do all of the parsing and DS will just forward the query?
2017-08-22 15:17:16	keveloper	so should DUI do all of the parsing and DS will just forward the query?
2017-08-22 15:17:16	na_th_an	the overhead isn't that much
2017-08-22 15:17:31	keveloper	for _every single search_
2017-08-22 15:17:36	keveloper	it would call the DS endpoint
2017-08-22 15:17:49	keveloper	OR DUI can parse the query and if there's nothing to send then it wont send it
2017-08-22 15:17:54	keveloper	because after parsing no:123 its just ''
2017-08-22 15:18:33	na_th_an	idk ask a tech lead
2017-08-22 15:18:47	keveloper	do you think that one extra request to DS is excessive
2017-08-22 15:18:49	keveloper	probably
2017-08-22 15:18:50	keveloper	i kinda do
2017-08-22 15:18:55	na_th_an	i do not
2017-08-22 15:18:58	keveloper	really
2017-08-22 15:19:06	na_th_an	no
2017-08-22 15:19:21	na_th_an	it's a single http request to a service running in the same datacenter
2017-08-22 15:19:48	keveloper	good point
2017-08-22 15:20:13	keveloper	idk DUI asking for suggestions on 'no:123' is kinda ridiculous I think
2017-08-22 15:27:34	keveloper	i just removed SO much spelling suggestion shit from DS
2017-08-22 15:27:38	 *	keveloper feels cleansed
2017-08-22 15:28:59	keveloper	holy shit
2017-08-22 15:29:06	keveloper	there was so much code around spelling suggestions before this is stupid
2017-08-22 15:32:05	keveloper	and its still going omg
2017-08-22 15:32:44	keveloper	        // This stack was written without namespaces; they were added back for spelling suggestions, and this is
2017-08-22 15:32:44	keveloper	        // a quick fix to get this stack working again without changing MANY, MANY xpaths.
2017-08-22 15:32:59	keveloper	sooo can i remove them? lol
2017-08-22 15:35:57	keveloper	i think i have successfully deleted all of them
2017-08-22 15:39:01	na_th_an	i cannot picture chris leight playing DnD
2017-08-22 15:39:03	na_th_an	at all
2017-08-22 15:39:05	na_th_an	or doing anything fun
2017-08-22 15:39:16	keveloper	ya lol
2017-08-22 15:39:21	na_th_an	I assume he goes home and drinks room temperature water waiting for work to start again
2017-08-22 15:41:23	na_th_an	i'm going to start trying to make my git histories better
2017-08-22 15:52:19	keveloper	help im really really confused
2017-08-22 15:52:44	keveloper	waaat the fuck
2017-08-22 15:53:09	keveloper	OOOH
2017-08-22 15:53:18	keveloper	got it:)
2017-08-22 15:56:46	keveloper	um what
2017-08-22 15:56:47	keveloper	new Locale('en_US').toLanguageTag()
2017-08-22 15:56:50	keveloper	return 'und'
2017-08-22 15:57:36	keveloper	am i confused on how spring binds 'en_US' to a locale
2017-08-22 15:57:53	keveloper	yes i am new Locale('en', 'us').toLanguageTag()
2017-08-22 15:57:55	keveloper	that works
2017-08-22 16:00:17	keveloper	boom got it
2017-08-22 16:02:56	keveloper	first time every doing something like this
2017-08-22 16:02:56	keveloper	mockRestTemplate.getForObject(match { it }, HashMap).never()
2017-08-22 16:03:09	na_th_an	why would you need that
2017-08-22 16:03:26	keveloper	to ensure when the parser returns nothing the provider never makes a request
2017-08-22 16:03:44	keveloper	because there's an if statement in there doing !parsedQuery.isEmpty()
2017-08-22 16:03:46	na_th_an	if you don't set up the mock then it'll throw an error if it does try to make request on a mocked object
2017-08-22 16:03:54	keveloper	True
2017-08-22 16:07:40	keveloper	are you remote java beans a thing
2017-08-22 16:07:45	keveloper	cause i'll need this bean in two places
2017-08-22 16:07:54	keveloper	or i guess you could just do a bean package or something that they both depend on
2017-08-22 16:07:55	na_th_an	are you sentence a thing
2017-08-22 16:08:01	keveloper	lol
2017-08-22 16:08:17	keveloper	but either way i'll just define it in two places because rip
2017-08-22 16:08:40	na_th_an	wut no
2017-08-22 16:08:57	keveloper	ya man its gonna be everywhere
2017-08-22 16:09:07	keveloper	its the next jmbutils
2017-08-22 16:09:12	keveloper	JMBeanUtils
2017-08-22 16:09:41	na_th_an	i'm so done with today
2017-08-22 16:09:46	keveloper	its gone by fast
2017-08-22 16:10:19	keveloper	idk why i just wrote this unit test i have to delete it now
2017-08-22 16:52:19	keveloper	yash is way too good at pool
2017-08-22 16:52:31	na_th_an	i'm terrible
2017-08-22 16:52:42	keveloper	:(
2017-08-22 16:52:47	keveloper	only one way to get better :D
2017-08-22 16:52:49	keveloper	i think its really fun
2017-08-22 16:52:56	na_th_an	not try and do something you're good at instead?
2017-08-22 16:53:20	keveloper	lol boo
2017-08-22 16:56:18	na_th_an	i like how janell sent a qa testing update that says no environmental issues
2017-08-22 16:56:27	na_th_an	then I tab over to cyndi asking about a system error in nit
2017-08-22 16:56:38	na_th_an	and saying it's flaky while she's trying to test
2017-08-22 16:57:00	keveloper	they provide more value to the company than us
2017-08-22 17:00:24	keveloper	what the actual fuck now DUI can't get ds domain shit
2017-08-23 09:33:42	na_th_an	there are times when I think gothalice knows exactly what she's doing
2017-08-23 09:33:55	na_th_an	then there are times when she says you should use make for a static site building tool
2017-08-23 09:34:07	keveloper	lol
2017-08-23 09:34:16	keveloper	i never really know
2017-08-23 09:34:24	keveloper	is her cms based on make
2017-08-23 09:34:25	keveloper	no way
2017-08-23 09:34:27	keveloper	i think its python
2017-08-23 09:40:24	keveloper	so the SAL gets the response and marshalls it to whatever object
2017-08-23 09:40:28	keveloper	the ESL does ?????
2017-08-23 09:40:45	keveloper	and the service does whatever business logic to around the request and response
2017-08-23 09:40:48	keveloper	wtf does the ESL do
2017-08-23 09:41:21	keveloper	the citation service ESL seems to just wrap SAL calls in a catch
2017-08-23 09:41:23	na_th_an	ESL sets up the request 
2017-08-23 09:41:35	keveloper	my request is a string
2017-08-23 09:42:16	na_th_an	idk usually if your design is good you don't really need the ESL
2017-08-23 09:42:34	na_th_an	but I think the general idea is that you'd pass an object to the ESL
2017-08-23 09:42:38	keveloper	none of the request objects have locale how does it get on the request
2017-08-23 09:42:42	na_th_an	the ESL would pull out the pieces it needs to construct the request 
2017-08-23 09:42:53	na_th_an	and pass those values to the SAL
2017-08-23 09:43:07	keveloper	hmm so the ESL could do the parsing of the query?
2017-08-23 09:43:19	keveloper	from search query to suggestion query
2017-08-23 09:43:21	keveloper	ya
2017-08-23 09:44:19	keveloper	you guys didn't do the SAL interface SALImplp thing
2017-08-23 09:44:23	keveloper	Im teling on u
2017-08-23 09:44:37	na_th_an	I don't see a reason to have an interface with one implementation
2017-08-23 09:44:39	na_th_an	i don't get it 
2017-08-23 09:44:43	na_th_an	i've tried to figure it out
2017-08-23 09:44:44	keveloper	yeah it makes no sense
2017-08-23 09:44:45	na_th_an	i see no value
2017-08-23 09:44:46	keveloper	literally no sense
2017-08-23 09:44:50	keveloper	it is actually useless
2017-08-23 09:44:52	keveloper	idk why we do that
2017-08-23 09:45:10	keveloper	idk if i should matcch the standard or do iot the smart way idk
2017-08-23 09:46:37	keveloper	idk where to put this query parsing stuff in DUI
2017-08-23 09:46:42	keveloper	i guess it could be a converter?
2017-08-23 09:47:39	keveloper	I also like how our converters are just all over the place
2017-08-23 09:47:50	keveloper	pick a module any module
2017-08-23 09:48:09	na_th_an	well our dependency tree is fucked anyway
2017-08-23 09:48:16	na_th_an	because business-services depends on webapp
2017-08-23 09:49:32	keveloper	lol
2017-08-23 09:49:47	keveloper	i have no idea where to put this parsing stuff
2017-08-23 09:50:01	keveloper	input is String out is String so converter doesn't make sense
2017-08-23 09:58:27	na_th_an	binaebi opened up dui and changed some css rules in her browser and sent them to me
2017-08-23 09:58:31	na_th_an	and they are completely unresponsive
2017-08-23 09:58:36	na_th_an	would not work at all
2017-08-23 09:58:37	keveloper	lol
2017-08-23 09:58:42	keveloper	like what
2017-08-23 09:59:44	na_th_an	http://kesslern-mbpdu.oa.oclc.org:9090/styles.png
2017-08-23 09:59:56	keveloper	are you python hosting
2017-08-23 10:00:02	na_th_an	darkhttpd m8
2017-08-23 10:00:12	keveloper	she wants it to look like that
2017-08-23 10:00:21	na_th_an	ya apparently
2017-08-23 10:00:26	keveloper	that looks terrible
2017-08-23 10:00:32	na_th_an	*shrug* Im' not ux
2017-08-23 10:00:48	keveloper	that looks so bad
2017-08-23 10:00:52	na_th_an	which parts
2017-08-23 10:00:56	keveloper	the left
2017-08-23 10:01:11	keveloper	how do you know how big the scope statement will be
2017-08-23 10:01:38	keveloper	have fun restructuring the dom to do that
2017-08-23 10:01:43	na_th_an	yup
2017-08-23 10:01:49	keveloper	or be like "that look s bad"
2017-08-23 10:01:51	keveloper	because it does
2017-08-23 10:02:02	keveloper	why the hell would the facets be lower
2017-08-23 10:02:03	na_th_an	eh i think it looks fine
2017-08-23 10:02:13	na_th_an	you think everything looks bad
2017-08-23 10:02:33	keveloper	there's literally no reason for it to be lower than the top of the container
2017-08-23 10:02:40	keveloper	it just wastes space
2017-08-23 10:02:46	keveloper	and makes you scroll a little further
2017-08-23 10:03:08	na_th_an	it lines it up with the search results
2017-08-23 10:03:27	keveloper	Then the scope statement should be 100% of the width
2017-08-23 10:03:43	keveloper	also i understand it lines up with the saerch results im saying there's no reason
2017-08-23 10:03:53	na_th_an	that's the reason
2017-08-23 10:03:56	keveloper	you should make the scope statement 100% width and see how it looks
2017-08-23 10:04:10	keveloper	is 2,055 results in ____ Sorted by: _____ not part of the results
2017-08-23 10:04:20	na_th_an	how about I just try to get this ticket done because this is the 3rd time she's having me make changes 
2017-08-23 10:04:34	keveloper	why cant she just make it how she wants in the wire frame initially
2017-08-23 10:04:39	na_th_an	3hard
2017-08-23 10:20:23	keveloper	was rashmis banana bread s upposed to be for the potluck lol
2017-08-23 10:21:12	keveloper	wonder how much time this person is wasting going the make route on this
2017-08-23 10:22:19	na_th_an	i don't think so
2017-08-23 10:22:45	na_th_an	"yes there's a known issue in find but we didn't feel like telling anyone"
2017-08-23 10:22:46	na_th_an	fuckers
2017-08-23 10:22:56	na_th_an	maybe if they had a fucking mailing list for notifications
2017-08-23 10:23:14	keveloper	i dont udnerstand how that team is not accountable for anayhtringh
2017-08-23 10:23:17	keveloper	wow
2017-08-23 10:23:20	keveloper	anayhtringh
2017-08-23 10:23:22	keveloper	anything
2017-08-23 10:23:24	na_th_an	yeah idk
2017-08-23 10:52:16	keveloper	na_th_an v kerrang
2017-08-23 10:52:18	keveloper	Go!
2017-08-23 10:52:53	na_th_an	not trying to pick a fight or change minds
2017-08-23 10:52:55	na_th_an	just trying to learn
2017-08-23 11:28:41	keveloper	i have not been productive today help
2017-08-23 11:30:12	keveloper	would it make sense for a converter to take a string and return a string
2017-08-23 11:30:23	na_th_an	ya
2017-08-23 11:30:26	na_th_an	why not
2017-08-23 11:30:33	keveloper	but then I can't use the conversion service
2017-08-23 11:30:33	na_th_an	this is why java should have type aliases
2017-08-23 11:30:35	keveloper	which is fine
2017-08-23 11:30:40	na_th_an	you could
2017-08-23 11:30:45	na_th_an	it'd be kinda weird tho
2017-08-23 11:30:47	keveloper	how
2017-08-23 11:30:54	na_th_an	wrapper objects that contain a string
2017-08-23 11:30:58	na_th_an	or classes that extend string
2017-08-23 11:31:00	keveloper	mehh
2017-08-23 11:31:03	keveloper	hmmm
2017-08-23 11:31:10	keveloper	QueryString and SuggestionString or something
2017-08-23 11:31:18	keveloper	that is not that bad of an idea
2017-08-23 11:32:59	keveloper	how often do you click on create groovy class instead of create package
2017-08-23 11:36:22	keveloper	why is there a sal package just for SAYT
2017-08-23 11:36:25	keveloper	like wtf
2017-08-23 11:37:40	keveloper	ugh
2017-08-23 11:37:46	keveloper	should SuggestionString be in DSDomain
2017-08-23 11:37:51	keveloper	so DS accepts a SuggestionString
2017-08-23 11:37:55	keveloper	probably not it's just a tsinr
2017-08-23 11:37:56	keveloper	string*
2017-08-23 11:40:08	keveloper	wait what
2017-08-23 11:40:12	keveloper	you can't extend string
2017-08-23 11:40:16	keveloper	because it's a final class
2017-08-23 11:44:56	na_th_an	:o
2017-08-23 11:45:44	na_th_an	you could use a groovy delegate
2017-08-23 11:50:21	keveloper	hmmm
2017-08-23 11:53:29	na_th_an	after using haskell for a few hours I REALLY wish java had type aliases
2017-08-23 11:53:42	na_th_an	like sure this is a String
2017-08-23 11:53:45	na_th_an	that's great for the JVM
2017-08-23 11:53:50	na_th_an	idgaf that it's a string
2017-08-23 11:53:53	na_th_an	WHAT is it
2017-08-23 11:54:12	na_th_an	lololololol
2017-08-23 11:54:17	na_th_an	jim pennington conversation
2017-08-23 11:54:24	na_th_an	"Right... yeah... yeah... HDMI 1"
2017-08-23 11:55:44	keveloper	so merk is asking emily for a quote for a tagline and shes saying $160 right now
2017-08-23 11:55:52	keveloper	she hasn't told him yet but
2017-08-23 11:55:53	keveloper	i think thats low
2017-08-23 11:56:02	keveloper	taglines are big for a company yanno, they provide a lot of value
2017-08-23 11:57:11	na_th_an	idk man
2017-08-23 11:57:29	keveloper	from what I see from googling around its' like $500-$1500
2017-08-23 11:57:40	keveloper	for independent writers
2017-08-23 11:57:41	keveloper	but

2017-08-23 12:55:52	na_th_an	it'd be cool if every time they changed the requirements we had some documentation 
2017-08-23 12:56:03	na_th_an	so we could point at how many times requirements changed when they say "why did this take so long"

2017-08-24 13:37:32	na_th_an	honestly I think a big part of it is HR being bad at their job too
2017-08-24 13:37:34	keveloper	i was about to head over to capital to talk to the director about hiring someone
2017-08-24 13:37:43	keveloper	oh rly
2017-08-24 13:37:47	na_th_an	yeah
2017-08-24 13:38:12	na_th_an	I don't have any direct evidence to support it, but based on all my experiences with HR I don't think they're getting the best resumes to give rashmi 
2017-08-24 13:38:17	na_th_an	they can't even set up a phone interview
2017-08-24 13:38:26	na_th_an	they can't get skype to work
2017-08-24 13:38:28	keveloper	i thought rashmi saw all of the resumes
2017-08-24 13:38:36	na_th_an	they didn't have us collect resumes at codemash, ever
2017-08-24 13:38:42	na_th_an	she does 
2017-08-24 13:38:47	na_th_an	but only the ones HR gets

2017-09-05 15:20:19	keveloper	its pure backend changes too
2017-09-05 15:20:27	keveloper	like that should take MAXIMUM 4 hours to test
2017-09-05 15:20:49	na_th_an	yeah it seems like they can just put whatever they want there and nobody cares
2017-09-05 15:20:51	keveloper	no wonder abbys fucking online shopping all the time she needs to make up for the other 20+ hours of her estimates
2017-09-05 15:20:56	keveloper	its absolutely ridiculous
2017-09-05 15:20:57	na_th_an	yup
2017-09-05 15:21:05	na_th_an	i wonder what it's like to work at a place with real qa
2017-09-05 15:21:06	keveloper	no fucking way its going to take more than 4 hours to test did you mean
2017-09-05 15:21:14	keveloper	the _only_ thing that might take a while is languages
2017-09-05 15:21:17	keveloper	thats it
2017-09-05 15:21:19	na_th_an	"well we don't really care about security testing" <- qa director
2017-09-05 15:21:30	keveloper	i need to setup perf testing for this
2017-09-05 15:21:42	keveloper	also i need to talk with fucking hakeem about a punctuation dictonary for SOLR
2017-09-05 15:21:47	keveloper	that should take a good 4 months
2017-09-05 15:21:48	na_th_an	I can picture being in a job interview and they ask why I want to leave OCLC and I'll mention that line
2017-09-05 15:22:03	keveloper	who said that
2017-09-05 15:22:15	na_th_an	bayko
2017-09-05 15:22:26	na_th_an	when I was telling him about how much better abby was than brett 
2017-09-05 15:22:30	keveloper	lol
2017-09-05 15:22:41	na_th_an	"abby knows how to test for security vulnerabilities"
2017-09-05 15:22:44	keveloper	brett does xss stuff when he tests
2017-09-05 15:22:47	na_th_an	"well, historically we don't really care about that"
2017-09-05 15:22:59	keveloper	no wonder there are so many xss issues in dui
2017-09-05 15:23:05	keveloper	were*
2017-09-05 15:23:06	keveloper	at least
2017-09-05 15:23:24	na_th_an	i mean brett probably knows "put this code in inputs and see if an alert appears"
2017-09-05 15:23:34	keveloper	i have a really weird habit of hitting backspace when I press enter
2017-09-05 15:23:36	na_th_an	but he probably doesn't really understand what's happening
2017-09-05 15:23:37	keveloper	i just did it now
2017-09-05 15:23:47	keveloper	like i'll hit enter, then backspace
2017-09-05 15:23:53	keveloper	idk why its bizarre
2017-09-05 15:23:57	keveloper	i just did it again

2017-09-05 15:25:04	na_th_an	but that's a problem specific to the ergodox
2017-09-05 15:25:22	keveloper	lol
2017-09-06 09:01:41	na_th_an	haley is back on birth control \o/

2017-09-06 09:11:19	na_th_an	you can see the output
2017-09-06 09:11:25	na_th_an	I think it's curl?
2017-09-06 09:11:53	keveloper	i mean it might be like perl's get or somethign
2017-09-06 09:12:08	keveloper	hmmmm
2017-09-06 09:12:16	keveloper	http://dashboard-m1.shr.oclc.org/hostInfo/hostUtilities.cgi?gen=1&host=dmwsrvap01pxdu.prod.oclc.org&utility=urlCheck&urlToCheck=http%3A%2F%2Fsolrap-m1.prod.oclc.org%2Fbridge%2Fspelling%2Fen-us%2Fhrary&.cgifields=useProxyServer
2017-09-06 09:12:19	keveloper	what do you make of this
2017-09-06 09:13:18	keveloper	that's no good
2017-09-06 09:13:33	na_th_an	I get a connection reset hitting http://solrap-m1.prod.oclc.org/bridge/spelling/en-us/hrary
2017-09-06 09:13:40	keveloper	from local ya
2017-09-06 09:13:43	keveloper	its behind a firewall
2017-09-06 09:13:47	na_th_an	oh prod ic
2017-09-06 09:14:04	na_th_an	well it looks like it's not running correctly
2017-09-06 09:14:19	keveloper	yeah idk

2017-09-06 09:14:21	na_th_an	it got a reply from server it was just empty
2017-09-06 09:14:24	na_th_an	not network
2017-09-06 09:14:41	keveloper	yeah
2017-09-06 09:15:02	keveloper	that's why it'd be cool if the fucking solr team would REPLYYYYYYYY
2017-09-06 09:15:04	keveloper	jesus
2017-09-06 09:16:03	keveloper	like this is supposed to be a 404 http://solrap-m1.prod.oclc.org/bridge/spelling/
2017-09-06 09:16:08	keveloper	but it gives the empty reply from server
2017-09-06 09:16:18	na_th_an	idk man
2017-09-06 09:16:26	na_th_an	maybe ask the team that supports it and make them fucking reply
2017-09-06 09:16:32	keveloper	shit
2017-09-06 09:16:39	keveloper	http://dashboard-m1.shr.oclc.org/hostInfo/hostUtilities.cgi?gen=1&host=ffhddb01pxdu.prod.oclc.org&utility=urlCheck&urlToCheck=http%3A%2F%2Fsolrap-m1.prod.oclc.org%2Fbridge%2Fspelling%2F&.cgifields=useProxyServer
2017-09-06 09:16:52	keveloper	it works from ffhd
2017-09-06 09:17:50	keveloper	god dammit angela
2017-09-06 09:17:53	keveloper	god fucking dammit
2017-09-06 09:17:58	na_th_an	??
2017-09-06 09:17:58	keveloper	GOOD DAMMIT NO
2017-09-06 09:18:02	keveloper	she was wrong
2017-09-06 09:18:09	keveloper	she said DS was in the right network layer but it is not
2017-09-06 09:18:34	na_th_an	oh cool
2017-09-06 09:18:48	keveloper	DUI -> SOLR and DS -> SOLR have the same response
2017-09-06 09:18:53	keveloper	DUI is definitely in the wrong network
2017-09-06 09:19:00	keveloper	FFHD -> SOLR works
2017-09-06 09:19:03	keveloper	in prod
2017-09-06 09:19:17	keveloper	why dont they have this firewall shit setup in dev and stuff
2017-09-06 09:19:23	na_th_an	well DS can access mysql can't it
2017-09-06 09:19:31	keveloper	yeah im confused
2017-09-06 09:19:38	na_th_an	i think that means its in the correct layer
2017-09-06 09:19:40	keveloper	http://dashboard-m1.shr.oclc.org/hostInfo/hostUtilities.cgi?gen=1&host=oclistsws01pxm1.prod.oclc.org&utility=urlCheck&urlToCheck=http%3A%2F%2Fsolrap-m1.prod.oclc.org%2Fbridge%2Fspelling%2F&.cgifields=useProxyServer
2017-09-06 09:19:42	na_th_an	and that network is just fucking up
2017-09-06 09:19:45	keveloper	goooood dammit
2017-09-06 09:19:53	keveloper	load balancer probably
2017-09-06 09:19:56	na_th_an	who do you think made a mistake: network in setting up their shit, or Angela
2017-09-06 09:19:58	keveloper	OUR NETWORK TEAM IS THE BEST
2017-09-06 09:20:01	keveloper	SO GUD
2017-09-06 09:20:07	keveloper	BEST TEAM
2017-09-06 09:20:10	keveloper	100% good
2017-09-06 09:21:16	keveloper	idk man
2017-09-06 09:21:16	keveloper	http://dashboard-m1.shr.oclc.org/hostInfo/hostUtilities.cgi?gen=1&host=dmwsrvap01pxdu.prod.oclc.org&utility=urlCheck&urlToCheck=solrap01pxm1.prod.oclc.org%3A8080&.cgifields=useProxyServer
2017-09-06 09:21:32	keveloper	(8080 is the correct port)
2017-09-06 09:21:47	keveloper	how is OLS in the right layer but DS is not
2017-09-06 09:21:50	keveloper	im still confused
2017-09-06 09:22:54	keveloper	ds host to solr host doesn't work
2017-09-06 09:22:59	keveloper	list host to solr host works
2017-09-06 09:24:38	na_th_an	<shrug/>
2017-09-06 09:24:53	keveloper	idk what to do about this
2017-09-06 09:25:02	na_th_an	email network and ask for help 
2017-09-06 09:25:14	na_th_an	might as well open a service now request before you send the email so you can include the request #
2017-09-06 09:25:30	na_th_an	also open a SN request to have them read the email
2017-09-06 09:25:38	na_th_an	and maybe open one asking tem to reply
2017-09-06 09:27:23	keveloper	idk if this is wrong or not
2017-09-06 09:27:29	keveloper	like there might nothing to fix
2017-09-06 09:27:35	keveloper	DS is just not where we thought it was
2017-09-06 09:27:43	na_th_an	there are 3 layers right?
2017-09-06 09:27:57	na_th_an	DS can talk to mysql and we never added a security exception for that
2017-09-06 09:28:02	na_th_an	mysql is in the data layer
2017-09-06 09:28:05	na_th_an	that's layer 3
2017-09-06 09:28:12	na_th_an	DS is not in data layer
2017-09-06 09:28:14	na_th_an	so it must be layer 2
2017-09-06 09:28:31	na_th_an	meaning DS is a whore that'll talk to anybody
2017-09-06 09:28:33	na_th_an	or should be 
2017-09-06 09:28:47	keveloper	lol what
2017-09-06 09:29:05	na_th_an	layer 2 can communicate with any other layer
2017-09-06 09:29:28	keveloper	are there only 3 layers
2017-09-06 09:29:35	keveloper	why is solr so deep in this lol
2017-09-06 09:30:09	keveloper	do we have a non remediated app thats definitely layer 2
2017-09-06 09:30:27	na_th_an	DR
2017-09-06 09:30:29	na_th_an	I'm pretty sure
2017-09-06 09:30:52	keveloper	DR is getting connection reset as well
2017-09-06 09:31:01	keveloper	timeout i mean
2017-09-06 09:31:20	keveloper	so its not all pxdu because firefly pxdu can call solr
2017-09-06 09:32:15	na_th_an	empty response != connection reset
2017-09-06 09:32:17	na_th_an	i think
2017-09-06 09:32:42	keveloper	farm is doing the empty response thing
2017-09-06 09:32:48	keveloper	host to host is doing connection timeout
2017-09-06 09:33:00	na_th_an	host to host communication is banned
2017-09-06 09:33:06	na_th_an	not allowed
2017-09-06 09:33:18	keveloper	except from list service
2017-09-06 09:33:18	na_th_an	farms only
2017-09-06 09:33:20	keveloper	and firefly
2017-09-06 09:33:27	na_th_an	it's supposed to be farms only
2017-09-06 09:33:49	keveloper	is that a thing
2017-09-06 09:33:58	keveloper	i think they say that but there's nothing to enforce it
2017-09-06 09:34:56	keveloper	either way DR and DS can  both not hit solr
2017-09-06 09:34:59	keveloper	but list service can
2017-09-06 09:35:18	keveloper	wghats discovery cite host
2017-09-06 09:36:22	keveloper	oh of course disccws
2017-09-06 09:36:50	keveloper	so it looks like remediated things in layer 2 can hit solr
2017-09-06 09:36:55	keveloper	non remediated layer things cannot
2017-09-06 09:37:02	keveloper	non remediated layer 3 things can
2017-09-06 09:37:33	keveloper	is it network engineering team
2017-09-06 09:37:38	keveloper	i haven't email them outside of srt lol
2017-09-06 09:38:01	na_th_an	netadm
2017-09-06 09:38:38	keveloper	what layer is it BL?
2017-09-06 09:38:43	keveloper	UI/BL/Data?
2017-09-06 09:38:47	na_th_an	i think so
2017-09-06 10:01:47	keveloper	in my email: "I can open a service now ticket if needed."
2017-09-06 10:02:03	keveloper	anthony travis's reply: "We are trying very hard to track the work we become involved.  In order to do that, we have been attempting to have Service Now requests for all requested work.  Would you be able to provide this information in a request record?"
2017-09-06 10:02:04	keveloper	ok
2017-09-06 10:02:42	na_th_an	for getting a question answered?
2017-09-06 10:02:48	keveloper	lol
2017-09-06 10:02:54	keveloper	i mean maybe they glanced and found something wrong with it idk
2017-09-06 11:31:34	keveloper	check out #frontend talking about frontend
2017-09-06 11:33:17	na_th_an	tab over and see "nickp | it makes it impossible for natural birth."
2017-09-07 10:13:13	keveloper	im still confused about qa estimates
2017-09-07 10:13:29	na_th_an	me too
2017-09-07 10:13:42	na_th_an	I'm confused about a lot of things regarding QA
2017-09-07 10:13:48	na_th_an	brett has no idea what's going on
2017-09-07 10:13:52	keveloper	tru
2017-09-07 10:16:33	na_th_an	"if it was urgent I would have called you but it wasn't so I didn't but I was still expecting you to reply immediately"
2017-09-07 10:16:40	na_th_an	I just can't believe that conversation I had with rashmi
2017-09-07 10:16:55	keveloper	lol
2017-09-07 10:16:56	keveloper	idfk
2017-09-07 10:17:12	keveloper	i feel like she's just really self centered and inconsiderate
2017-09-07 10:17:15	keveloper	and it percolates into everything
2017-09-07 10:17:29	keveloper	like she expects you to instantly reply because _she_ emailed oyu
2017-09-07 10:17:30	keveloper	you*
2017-09-07 10:17:32	na_th_an	I wonder if she's a sociopath
2017-09-07 10:17:42	na_th_an	it honestly wouldn't surprise me
2017-09-07 10:18:07	keveloper	idk but she's really incosiderate when people are leaving the office and she stops them and talks to them for 15 minutes
2017-09-07 10:18:13	na_th_an	seriously
2017-09-07 10:18:15	keveloper	like she doesn't even think twice about it
2017-09-07 10:18:24	na_th_an	she does not seem to have much if any empathy
2017-09-07 10:18:27	keveloper	and whatever she wants to do is more important than whatever you want to do
2017-09-07 10:18:30	keveloper	yeah
2017-09-07 10:51:06	keveloper	wtf migs
2017-09-07 10:51:51	na_th_an	yesterday there was a great conversation
2017-09-07 10:51:59	na_th_an	meese getting all pissed off 
2017-09-07 10:52:05	na_th_an	i forget what it was even about
2017-09-07 10:52:07	keveloper	Migs being a fuck
2017-09-07 10:52:13	keveloper	probably
2017-09-07 10:55:43	keveloper	angela wrote a ticket about scripting a metaproxy thing andd estimated it
2017-09-07 10:55:44	keveloper	all alone
2017-09-07 10:57:08	keveloper	"Moreover, metaproxy logs does not contain insitution regID and there are many cases where multiple institutions are sharing same Opac Z39.50 target server, so it is currently difficult to segregate metaproxy transactions by insitutions. "
2017-09-07 10:57:11	keveloper	difficult?
2017-09-07 10:57:14	keveloper	wouldnt that be impossible
2017-09-07 10:57:38	keveloper	Reports should be generated on a daily basis
2017-09-07 10:57:38	na_th_an	sounds like it
2017-09-07 10:57:44	keveloper	on what server
2017-09-07 10:57:52	keveloper	time to go throw more shit on optomom i guess
2017-09-07 11:28:35	keveloper	lol
2017-09-07 11:28:39	keveloper	look at frontend
2017-09-07 11:29:17	na_th_an	what
2017-09-07 11:29:27	keveloper	"most houses are brick now"
2017-09-07 14:47:40	 *	keveloper made the mistake of bringing up the ghost in the shell movie in front of binaebi
2017-09-07 14:47:47	na_th_an	lol
2017-09-07 14:47:52	na_th_an	idk anything about it
2017-09-07 14:47:59	na_th_an	other than apparently literal whitewashing
2017-09-07 14:48:13	keveloper	yeah idk
2017-09-07 14:48:15	keveloper	i dont either
2017-09-07 14:48:22	keveloper	but binaebi got all triggered when i brought it up so
2017-09-07 14:56:27	keveloper	"anything with agile is going to be bad"
2017-09-07 14:56:28	keveloper	uh what

2017-09-07 14:57:32	keveloper	why does he hate everything
2017-09-07 14:57:47	na_th_an	because he never grew out of a 14 year old's mindset
2017-09-07 14:57:53	keveloper	oh ok
2017-09-07 14:57:59	na_th_an	i mean really
2017-09-07 14:58:04	na_th_an	he's full of the teenage angst

2017-09-07 15:04:08	keveloper	and no one on salpicon knew about it lol
2017-09-07 15:04:21	keveloper	stephen was like "wtf" and asked barry and barry asked dan and dan was like "nope"

2017-09-11 15:36:08	keveloper	SiteCatalystInsertionApiRequester
2017-09-11 15:36:10	keveloper	wtf is this lol
2017-09-11 15:36:28	keveloper	like stats
2017-09-11 15:36:35	na_th_an	ya
2017-09-11 15:36:42	keveloper	like the click stats and stuff
2017-09-11 15:37:12	na_th_an	i think
2017-09-11 15:37:14	na_th_an	idk man
2017-09-11 15:37:21	na_th_an	omniture is all i know
2017-09-11 15:37:51	keveloper	"blah blah blah meaning blah blah"
2017-09-11 15:37:53	keveloper	i hate that
2017-09-11 15:38:00	keveloper	rashmi saying "... meaning.."
2017-09-11 15:39:07	keveloper	dude i dont think this is used
2017-09-11 15:39:25	na_th_an	i don't think dui uses omniture so probably not
2017-09-11 15:39:36	na_th_an	i'd be surprised if it was being used tbh
2017-09-11 15:39:51	na_th_an	owc uses omniture so maybe dui did at some point
2017-09-11 15:41:29	keveloper	why we have so much dead code
2017-09-11 15:41:45	na_th_an	because we don't delete it
2017-09-11 15:41:49	na_th_an	because people are afraid 
2017-09-11 15:41:54	na_th_an	because they don't understand dui
2017-09-11 15:42:04	na_th_an	i removed so much unused dead shit from searchcontroller because nobody understands dui
2017-09-11 15:42:13	na_th_an	so they were afraid of removing it
2017-09-11 15:42:15	na_th_an	"just in case"
2017-09-11 15:42:20	keveloper	do we still use google analytics
2017-09-11 15:42:27	na_th_an	maybe idk
2017-09-11 15:43:11	keveloper	NotificationBroadcaster
2017-09-11 15:43:14	keveloper	uses it
2017-09-11 15:44:58	keveloper	idek
2017-09-11 15:46:54	na_th_an	you'd think that network would be able to see all the outgoing traffic
2017-09-11 15:46:58	keveloper	http://dashboard-m1.shr.oclc.org/hostInfo/hostUtilities.cgi?gen=1&host=discoveryuiap01pxdu.prod.oclc.org&utility=networkConnections
2017-09-11 15:47:05	keveloper	i dont see it there
2017-09-11 15:47:07	na_th_an	and be like "ok ya all these will still get through on the new hosts"
2017-09-11 15:47:23	na_th_an	idk man maybe it's only used sometimes
2017-09-11 15:47:26	na_th_an	product would know
2017-09-11 15:47:28	na_th_an	hopefully
2017-09-11 15:48:38	keveloper	don't stats just go into the log file
2017-09-11 15:48:45	keveloper	and kibana parses it
2017-09-11 15:49:35	keveloper	i curled http://worldcat.112.2o7.net/b/ss/11/6 and got a completely empty response lol
2017-09-11 15:50:25	keveloper	posting returns some xml
2017-09-11 15:51:08	keveloper	here's an idea
2017-09-11 15:51:25	na_th_an	logback has a log encoder thing configured for logback that reads the webapp-out.log and sends it to logstash
2017-09-11 15:51:28	na_th_an	so ya pretty much
2017-09-11 15:51:45	na_th_an	i wet there in the browser and got xml back
2017-09-11 15:51:51	keveloper	id id
2017-09-11 15:52:14	keveloper	so old dui hosts can hit it
2017-09-11 15:52:22	keveloper	should i just ask for an exemption
2017-09-11 15:52:34	keveloper	im confused why i dont see it or any of it's IPs from nslookup in the network traffic
2017-09-11 15:52:53	na_th_an	what you could do is run dui locally and put that host to localhost and run a python script or something that shows the http requests its getting
2017-09-11 15:53:05	na_th_an	run with prod config and developer mode false
2017-09-11 15:53:27	na_th_an	i'd bet it isn't used
2017-09-11 15:54:39	keveloper	i <3 you
2017-09-11 15:55:01	na_th_an	so uhh
2017-09-11 15:55:33	na_th_an	the only place i see this site catalyst stuff being used is that there's a sal for it
2017-09-11 15:55:42	na_th_an	and i don't think that sal is used anywhere except the health check
2017-09-11 15:55:46	keveloper	keep looking the sal is used
2017-09-11 15:56:48	keveloper	how do you turn off dev mode
2017-09-11 15:56:56	na_th_an	the SiteCatalystEventListener that isn't used?
2017-09-11 15:57:14	keveloper	look at the usages for the method
2017-09-11 15:57:29	na_th_an	-Dorg.oclc.discovery#developerMode=false
2017-09-11 15:58:13	keveloper	k i have a python server running at 80 and worldcat.112.2o7.net is mapped to localhost
2017-09-11 15:58:30	na_th_an	where else is it used
2017-09-11 15:58:48	keveloper	which health check is it
2017-09-11 15:59:03	keveloper	GoogleAnalytics?
2017-09-11 15:59:38	na_th_an	no SiteCatalystServiceHealthCheck
2017-09-11 15:59:44	na_th_an	which doesn't seem to be activated
2017-09-11 15:59:55	na_th_an	more evidence for my "this isn't used" theory 
2017-09-11 16:00:26	keveloper	lol
2017-09-11 16:01:24	keveloper	no traffic yet
2017-09-11 16:01:33	keveloper	what should i try
2017-09-11 16:02:30	keveloper	omg
2017-09-11 16:02:32	keveloper	i went to atoz
2017-09-11 16:06:41	na_th_an	and
2017-09-11 16:07:10	keveloper	and it hit the python thing
2017-09-11 16:07:47	na_th_an	:o

2017-09-11 16:07:53	keveloper	got youuuuuu
2017-09-11 16:07:55	na_th_an	wanna verify the dc thing
2017-09-11 16:07:58	keveloper	yeah
2017-09-11 16:08:02	keveloper	im confused nothing was wrong with dev
2017-09-11 16:08:03	na_th_an	i was kinda surprised 
2017-09-11 16:08:09	na_th_an	but u got me
2017-09-11 16:09:48	keveloper	why did she say she fixed it in dev
2017-09-11 16:11:47	keveloper	so either i have never seen anna jones before or she looks nothing like her picture
2017-09-11 16:11:53	keveloper	but if she's not 21 she has me fooled
2017-09-11 16:16:34	na_th_an	the prod thing works now
2017-09-11 16:16:40	na_th_an	in prod the new dc hosts can hit rmsprod

2017-09-11 16:17:30	na_th_an	before that 
2017-09-11 16:17:40	na_th_an	when I said "wanna verify dc thing"
2017-09-11 16:17:45	na_th_an	i tried the connectivity check and it worked

2017-09-11 16:19:37	na_th_an	i've known that forever
2017-09-11 16:19:40	na_th_an	because it says "hosts"

2017-09-11 16:19:44	na_th_an	in the label

2017-09-15 14:25:48	keveloper	this is stupid
2017-09-15 14:26:00	na_th_an	regex to strip everything before the first number

2017-09-15 14:26:08	keveloper	Huh
2017-09-15 14:26:13	keveloper	but its not the first number
2017-09-15 14:26:23	keveloper	actual req is like
2017-09-15 14:26:26	keveloper	/INNOPAC&operation=searchRetrieve&version=1.2&recordSchema=opac&maximumRecords=5&x-pquery=@attr+1=1007%20@attr+4=1%20@attr+5=100+@or+@or+898057741+43684519+904792871
2017-09-15 14:26:37	keveloper	the case of the or's is easy
2017-09-15 14:26:54	keveloper	then there's this
2017-09-15 14:26:54	keveloper	?x-target=alephprod.umd.edu/WCL&x-max-sockets=60&operation=searchRetrieve&version=1.2&recordSchema=opac&maximumRecords=5&x-pquery=@attr%201=1211+01554210

2017-09-15 14:28:46	keveloper	I can _always_ split by = and take the last thing in the list

2017-09-15 14:29:04	keveloper	the stupid @or shit
2017-09-15 14:29:08	keveloper	and the 1211+0321321321321

2017-09-15 15:18:58	keveloper	I implemented this script that takes arguments and looks at an entire directory for logs then makes a sqlite db with the given name or uses and existing one and depending on another "new" argument then it parses a file and adds it to a sql database as usable data and has nice output with a file progress meter
2017-09-15 15:19:02	keveloper	in 8 hours
2017-09-15 15:19:03	keveloper	grade 15

2017-09-15 15:21:19	keveloper	i could estimate time for the file to be finished too if i time the gap between percentages
2017-09-15 15:21:30	keveloper	would be neat
2017-09-15 15:27:33	keveloper	can you calculate average from: average, n, and new value
2017-09-15 15:28:14	keveloper	this right
2017-09-15 15:28:15	keveloper	averageElapsed = (elapsed + (averageElapsed * numElapsed)) / numElapsed
2017-09-15 15:29:03	keveloper	wow that number just keeps getting bigger
2017-09-15 15:29:26	keveloper	it seems to be normalizing idk

2017-09-18 09:34:26	na_th_an	how cool would it be if OCLC paid other people to write automated development scripts that wrote code for us
2017-09-18 09:34:35	na_th_an	and we fired off those automated scripts
2017-09-18 09:35:04	na_th_an	and when they broke we went to the people that wrote the automated scripts and said "it's broken" and then they had to fix them
2017-09-18 10:04:10	na_th_an	index_html_template.tpl
2017-09-18 10:04:29	na_th_an	I'm glad they decided to use a nonstandard file extension to indicate this is a template
2017-09-18 10:04:43	keveloper	what is this
2017-09-18 10:04:43	na_th_an	and included 'template' twice in the name
2017-09-18 10:04:48	na_th_an	it's in user portal
2017-09-18 10:05:00	na_th_an	that's the extension they use for their html templates

2017-09-18 10:12:45	keveloper	do you think that makes a connection
2017-09-18 10:12:51	keveloper	the metaproxy thing
2017-09-18 10:12:55	keveloper	i think the sql part is the slow part
2017-09-18 10:13:03	keveloper	it _is_ a 1 million line file tho
2017-09-18 10:13:08	keveloper	but i guess thats not that big
2017-09-18 10:14:34	keveloper	oh shit "A DataSet can be configured to operate in a disconnected manner by setting the Select annotation element connected to false. This requires any changes made to the DataSet to be explicitly syncronized to the underlying data store. The DataSet.sync method must be called to propagate the DatasSet modifications to the data store. The modifications are done as an atomic operation.
2017-09-18 10:14:38	keveloper	i bet I want that
2017-09-18 10:14:40	keveloper	that's a cool feature
2017-09-18 10:17:13	na_th_an	user portal is full of ng-if="condition == true"
2017-09-18 10:17:18	na_th_an	glad they're comparing to true everywhere
2017-09-18 10:17:23	keveloper	lol
2017-09-18 10:17:24	keveloper	who wrote

2017-09-18 10:18:11	keveloper	shit so that cool sync feature i pasted above is for java's sql lib
2017-09-18 10:18:14	keveloper	im using groovys
2017-09-18 10:18:15	keveloper	uhhh

2017-09-18 10:19:08	na_th_an	I love useless intermediate variables
2017-09-18 10:19:14	keveloper	lol
2017-09-18 10:19:43	keveloper	so i could just save all of the objects then add them in batch but i feel like having 300 thousand java objects in memory wont go well
2017-09-18 10:20:04	keveloper	why groovy sql no have connection=false and sync
2017-09-18 10:20:07	keveloper	i was excite
2017-09-18 10:27:21	keveloper	withBatch
2017-09-18 10:27:24	keveloper	dude groovy is dope
2017-09-18 10:27:29	keveloper	http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/api/groovy/sql/DataSet.html#withBatch-int-groovy.lang.Closure-
2017-09-18 10:27:34	keveloper	look how clean that is
2017-09-18 10:28:10	na_th_an	noice
2017-09-18 10:29:22	keveloper	that might not even be what i want lol
2017-09-18 10:29:52	keveloper	cuz I wanna do like withBatch { //one thing in here } and when enough things are added to the batch it will add them
2017-09-18 10:30:09	na_th_an	wtf 
2017-09-18 10:30:13	keveloper	what
2017-09-18 10:30:38	keveloper	OH WAIT
2017-09-18 10:30:39	na_th_an	http://git.ent.oclc.org/projects/ES/repos/up-user-portal/browse/discovery-user-portal-application/src/main/resources/discovery-user-portal-application/app/saved-searches/saved.searches.list.controller.js
2017-09-18 10:30:46	na_th_an	look at onScreenSizeChange
2017-09-18 10:30:48	keveloper	I can put the entire thing in a withBatch
2017-09-18 10:30:51	keveloper	im dumb
2017-09-18 10:30:59	na_th_an	and look at how mobileView and desktopView are the same 
2017-09-18 10:31:02	na_th_an	-_-
2017-09-18 10:31:29	keveloper	what is this lol
2017-09-18 10:31:37	na_th_an	user portal 
2017-09-18 10:31:40	keveloper	but like
2017-09-18 10:31:44	keveloper	wtf is this method
2017-09-18 10:31:48	na_th_an	idfk
2017-09-18 10:31:55	keveloper	wtf
2017-09-18 10:31:59	na_th_an	a present from jvu
2017-09-18 10:32:03	 *	keveloper kills self
2017-09-18 13:06:31	keveloper	omg fml
2017-09-18 13:06:40	keveloper	i figured out why the time remaining was so wrong
2017-09-18 13:06:47	na_th_an	why
2017-09-18 13:07:06	keveloper	        long elapsed = Duration.between(then, now).getMillis()
2017-09-18 13:07:19	keveloper	err sorry getNano()
2017-09-18 13:07:20	keveloper	but
2017-09-18 13:07:26	keveloper	getNano does NOT convert the Duration to nano
2017-09-18 13:07:31	keveloper	it gets the nano second unit of the duration
2017-09-18 13:07:40	keveloper	so it was like 10 seconds and 9500 nanos
2017-09-18 13:07:47	keveloper	so i was using 9500 nanos
2017-09-18 13:07:56	keveloper	but what i really wanted was toNano() or toMillis()
2017-09-18 13:08:04	keveloper	that converts it
2017-09-18 13:08:22	na_th_an	lol
2017-09-18 13:08:23	keveloper	so i was treating the last unit as the duration
2017-09-18 13:08:24	keveloper	ya
2017-09-18 13:08:25	keveloper	stupid
2017-09-18 13:08:29	keveloper	now its really accurate though
2017-09-18 13:08:30	keveloper	:)
2017-09-18 13:08:34	na_th_an	yeah getNano is probably a getter
2017-09-18 13:08:38	na_th_an	not a converter :p
2017-09-18 13:08:41	keveloper	lolol
2017-09-18 13:09:29	keveloper	its pretty accurate tho its awesome
2017-09-18 13:10:04	na_th_an	except the parts where it stops to do the batch updates right 
2017-09-18 13:10:37	keveloper	it counts that along with it
2017-09-18 13:10:53	keveloper	the batch gets counted into the average everytime it happens
2017-09-18 13:11:26	keveloper	I changed it thouh so now I'm just counting from when it started, dividing that by the percent complete, then multiplying that by the percent remaining
2017-09-18 13:11:30	keveloper	works pretty well
2017-09-18 13:11:46	keveloper	3.6m to do the entire thing, down from 27.8m before batching \o/
2017-09-18 13:29:33	na_th_an	look at the qa estimate on https://jira.oclc.org/browse/DA-24253
2017-09-18 13:29:46	na_th_an	read that desciption and tell me if you think it should take 24 hours to test that
2017-09-18 13:29:47	keveloper	LOL
2017-09-18 13:29:48	keveloper	whyyyyyy
2017-09-18 13:29:50	keveloper	who did it
2017-09-18 13:30:00	keveloper	an entire work week
2017-09-18 13:30:06	keveloper	of making sure it looks slightly different
2017-09-18 13:30:15	na_th_an	cyndi
2017-09-18 13:31:09	keveloper	I thought we brewed sqlite_web
2017-09-18 13:31:12	keveloper	but i guess itw as pip
2017-09-18 13:34:18	keveloper	hows this readme http://git.ent.oclc.org/users/hollandk/repos/metaproxyanalysis/browse
2017-09-18 13:34:31	na_th_an	401 ice
2017-09-18 13:34:33	na_th_an	nice
2017-09-18 13:34:36	keveloper	oh oops
2017-09-18 13:34:49	keveloper	k go
2017-09-18 13:35:20	keveloper	shit how do you do bitbucket lists

2017-09-18 13:36:02	keveloper	there we go got i
2017-09-18 13:36:03	keveloper	t
2017-09-18 13:36:26	na_th_an	your link doesn't work
2017-09-18 13:36:30	na_th_an	to the logfile analysis tooll
2017-09-18 13:36:44	keveloper	oh wtf
2017-09-18 13:36:50	keveloper	its the same as teh sqlite one
2017-09-18 13:36:51	na_th_an	you should specify that "log location" is a folder
2017-09-18 13:36:57	na_th_an	and not a file
2017-09-18 13:37:14	keveloper	hows that
2017-09-18 13:37:21	keveloper	I do below but yeah I changed the name of it
2017-09-18 13:37:51	keveloper	confused why that link is brokn
2017-09-18 13:38:01	na_th_an	also if you want to follow standard gnu/unix documentation standards, then you should not have the braces around your parameter names
2017-09-18 13:38:15	keveloper	what should it be
2017-09-18 13:38:15	na_th_an	then instead of "1st argument" "2nd argument" you'd have your parameter names
2017-09-18 13:38:27	na_th_an	since they are all required parameters, just the parameter name
2017-09-18 13:38:33	na_th_an	if any are optional they'd be in []
2017-09-18 13:38:34	keveloper	the last one is not required
2017-09-18 13:39:18	keveloper	refresh
2017-09-18 13:39:20	keveloper	like that?
2017-09-18 13:39:31	na_th_an	yes
2017-09-18 13:39:42	na_th_an	i'd put the parameter names in backticks so they're monospaced
2017-09-18 13:40:02	keveloper	done
2017-09-18 13:40:22	na_th_an	looks p ok to me
2017-09-18 13:40:33	keveloper	i have no idea why the amp links isnt working
2017-09-18 13:40:38	keveloper	[LogFileAnalysis](http://dashboard-m1.shr.oclc.org/amp/amp.cgi?sysgroup=*&system=METAProxy&command=logFileAnalysis)
2017-09-18 13:40:46	keveloper	[sqlite_web](https://github.com/coleifer/sqlite-web)
2017-09-18 13:40:48	keveloper	they are the same
2017-09-18 13:41:04	keveloper	link worked in my markdown viewer
2017-09-18 13:41:12	keveloper	maybe encoding?
2017-09-18 13:42:47	keveloper	yeah i had to encode the asterisk
2017-09-18 13:43:45	na_th_an	aww I was gonna suggest that
2017-09-18 13:43:59	keveloper	lol
2017-09-18 13:50:31	keveloper	added script output to readme: http://git.ent.oclc.org/users/hollandk/repos/metaproxyanalysis/browse
2017-09-18 13:52:25	keveloper	ooh I'll add performance
2017-09-18 13:57:28	keveloper	performance is on there too now
2017-09-18 14:07:19	na_th_an	what fucking year is this
2017-09-18 14:07:27	na_th_an	jimmy used tables in user portal 
2017-09-18 14:07:29	na_th_an	for the saved searches
2017-09-18 14:07:34	na_th_an	every one of the saved searches is a table element
2017-09-18 14:07:35	keveloper	what do you mean
2017-09-18 14:07:42	keveloper	oh like

2017-09-18 16:27:12	keveloper	how the fuck would it POSSIBLY take 24 hours
2017-09-18 16:27:12	na_th_an	I want to ask her "so you think this is going to take 3 uninterrupted days to test this ticket?"
2017-09-18 16:27:18	keveloper	who is "she"
2017-09-18 16:27:19	keveloper	cyndi?
2017-09-18 16:27:21	na_th_an	cyndi
2017-09-18 16:27:35	keveloper	i might bring up the qa estimates to bill or rashmi
2017-09-18 16:27:38	keveloper	its like actually insane
2017-09-18 16:27:43	keveloper	they seem inflated as fuck
2017-09-18 16:27:58	na_th_an	rashmi is already kinda on it
2017-09-18 16:28:09	na_th_an	qa keeps telling her that they don't have enough time and they're in too many meetings
2017-09-18 16:28:12	na_th_an	and she thinks its bullshit
2017-09-18 16:30:43	keveloper	it seems so
2017-09-18 16:35:33	keveloper	so...
2017-09-18 16:35:38	keveloper	http://hollandk-1mbpdu.oa.oclc.org:8080/Z39Responses/content/
2017-09-18 16:35:44	keveloper	see how successful is a bool
2017-09-18 16:36:04	na_th_an	ya
2017-09-18 16:36:15	keveloper	http://hollandk-1mbpdu.oa.oclc.org:8080/Z39Responses/query/?sql=SELECT+%2A%0D%0AFROM+%22Z39Responses%22
2017-09-18 16:36:17	keveloper	when i query
2017-09-18 16:36:19	keveloper	it becomes an int
2017-09-18 16:36:20	keveloper	wtf
2017-09-18 16:36:36	keveloper	wats that about
2017-09-18 16:36:49	na_th_an	yeah internally sql servers don't usually have a separate type for booleans
2017-09-18 16:36:55	keveloper	oho k
2017-09-18 16:36:57	keveloper	oh ok
2017-09-18 16:37:19	keveloper	but
2017-09-18 16:37:20	keveloper	idk w/e
2017-09-18 16:37:22	na_th_an	that content tab is probably converting the 1s and 0s for boolean type columns
2017-09-18 16:37:24	keveloper	yeah
2017-09-18 16:37:35	na_th_an	when you do a query it just shows the data you got back in the query
2017-09-18 16:37:46	keveloper	yeah
2017-09-18 16:37:48	keveloper	word
2017-09-18 16:38:30	keveloper	well it was integer on accident and i changed it bool so at least thats bettewr
2017-09-18 16:38:39	na_th_an	i got user portal on the flexbox train
2017-09-18 16:38:45	keveloper	yay
2017-09-18 16:38:51	na_th_an	fuck floats 
2017-09-18 16:38:54	na_th_an	fuck floats so hard
2017-09-18 16:39:02	keveloper	yeah i literally never use them
2017-09-18 16:39:04	na_th_an	makes consistent margins fucking impossible
2017-09-18 16:39:08	keveloper	yeah
2017-09-18 16:39:21	keveloper	I've way underestimate the power of explicit position: relative tho
2017-09-18 16:39:22	keveloper	its amazing
2017-09-18 16:39:31	keveloper	underestimated***
2017-09-18 16:40:32	na_th_an	this morning jim pennington was talking about retirement
2017-09-18 16:41:00	na_th_an	his wife is 62 and retired but he says he's going to work into his 70s because they had to take a bunch of money out of their retirement fund for something or other and they're still catching up
2017-09-18 16:41:14	na_th_an	and he doesn't have any money in the stock markets at all
2017-09-18 16:41:30	na_th_an	like, he doesn't have his retirement account on any index funds or mutual funds or anything
2017-09-18 16:41:35	na_th_an	because he doesn't trust the stock market
2017-09-18 16:41:54	na_th_an	like rip, kms if i have to work into my 70s while my wife is retired 
2017-09-18 16:43:11	keveloper	I know right
2017-09-18 16:43:32	keveloper	thats weird
2017-09-18 16:43:34	keveloper	why
2017-09-18 16:43:53	keveloper	garbble garbble i dont trust the stock market
2017-09-18 16:43:53	na_th_an	why doesn't he trust the stock market?
2017-09-18 16:44:03	na_th_an	idk, old people I guess
2017-09-18 16:47:14	keveloper	angela said "bonus points for [the progress bar and time remaining]"
2017-09-18 16:50:35	keveloper	why is stephen like never here
2017-09-18 16:51:00	keveloper	my phone just died what a joke

2017-09-18 16:52:19	na_th_an	this contractor at haley's work got fired for not coming in
2017-09-18 16:52:47	na_th_an	she missed 3-4 days a week for a few weeks in a row then one day they're like "we really need to you to come in" and she said "sure"
2017-09-18 16:53:00	na_th_an	then every hour she texted the boss and said she'd be there in an hour
2017-09-18 16:53:08	na_th_an	stopped doing that at noon
2017-09-18 16:53:16	na_th_an	and they're like "ok we're firing her"
2017-09-18 16:53:27	keveloper	lol wtf

2017-09-18 16:53:37	na_th_an	i can't even picture doing that wtf
2017-09-18 16:53:45	na_th_an	at least be honest
2017-09-18 16:53:48	keveloper	yeah
2017-09-18 16:53:50	keveloper	like
2017-09-18 16:53:51	keveloper	ahg
2017-09-18 16:53:56	keveloper	how do you get to the point in your life

2017-09-18 16:54:38	na_th_an	i'm doing a user portal build then leaving 
2017-09-18 16:56:07	keveloper	building multi-line messages in an app that uses enter as send is scary
2017-09-18 16:56:14	keveloper	Shift-enter v careful
2017-09-18 16:56:28	na_th_an	lol I know the feel
2017-09-18 16:56:33	keveloper	i added something for angela and the performance went from
2017-09-18 16:56:34	keveloper	The script can parse about 804,000 lines a minute. This works out to about 80,000 Metaproxy requests a minute and 235,000 Z39.50 requests a minute.
2017-09-18 16:56:38	keveloper	to
2017-09-18 16:56:39	keveloper	The script can parse about 723,600 lines a minute. This works out to about 72,000 Metaproxy requests a minute and 211,500 Z39.50 requests a minute.
2017-09-18 16:56:46	keveloper	NOOO
2017-09-18 16:56:59	keveloper	She added another requestType to insert to the db
2017-09-18 16:57:00	keveloper	rip
2017-09-18 16:57:06	na_th_an	rip
2017-09-18 16:57:14	keveloper	I might play with the batching more
2017-09-18 16:57:18	keveloper	i feel like it should be faster
2017-09-18 16:57:25	na_th_an	can you make it async
2017-09-18 16:57:25	keveloper	angela was impressed with the speed too
2017-09-18 16:57:27	keveloper	woo go batching
2017-09-18 16:57:31	keveloper	uhh probably
2017-09-18 16:57:40	keveloper	how easy is this about to be in groovy
2017-09-18 16:57:40	na_th_an	right now it's syncronous right
2017-09-18 16:57:44	keveloper	yes
2017-09-18 16:57:48	na_th_an	async dat shit
2017-09-18 16:57:53	na_th_an	completable future
2017-09-18 16:57:56	na_th_an	or something idk
2017-09-18 16:58:20	keveloper	i have a closure so I feel like I should be able to easily dispatch it
2017-09-18 16:58:29	keveloper	I don't need to wait for any response code or anoything
2017-09-18 16:58:40	na_th_an	you wanna make sure it's finished before you end the process tho
2017-09-18 16:58:45	keveloper	yeah true
2017-09-18 16:58:50	keveloper	no
2017-09-18 16:58:51	keveloper	no way
2017-09-18 16:58:56	keveloper	task closure()
2017-09-18 16:58:59	keveloper	parallel
2017-09-18 16:59:01	keveloper	HOLY SHIT
2017-09-18 16:59:14	keveloper	thats actually insane
2017-09-18 16:59:50	na_th_an	ok I'm turning off computer for the night

2017-09-18 16:59:55	keveloper	bye
2017-09-19 08:59:12	keveloper	i left my murrays pomade at my apt
2017-09-19 08:59:25	keveloper	so i had to do my hair with hairspray it was annoying
2017-09-19 08:59:34	na_th_an	lol
2017-09-19 08:59:36	na_th_an	rip up
2017-09-19 08:59:38	na_th_an	u
2017-09-19 08:59:39	keveloper	ikno
2017-09-19 08:59:56	keveloper	so idk what im doing wrong but paralellizing was not going well
2017-09-19 08:59:58	na_th_an	dave opened up another fucking huge PR that's impossible to review
2017-09-19 09:01:05	keveloper	why he do that
2017-09-19 09:01:09	na_th_an	idfk
2017-09-19 09:01:18	na_th_an	nobody from salpicon is on it either
2017-09-19 09:01:20	na_th_an	just us
2017-09-19 09:01:30	na_th_an	he should have his "feature team" on it
2017-09-19 09:01:57	na_th_an	it's for this release???????????????? wtf
2017-09-19 09:02:24	keveloper	holy shit
2017-09-19 09:02:28	keveloper	its huge
2017-09-19 09:06:54	keveloper	a looot of these are wiremock
2017-09-19 09:07:16	na_th_an	wait
2017-09-19 09:07:27	keveloper	i closed things related to wiremock and it became managable
2017-09-19 09:07:28	na_th_an	is the wiremock stuff in its own module
2017-09-19 09:07:39	na_th_an	or did they add it to the mock integration module?
2017-09-19 09:07:49	keveloper	its in the mock-integration modules
2017-09-19 09:07:54	keveloper	wait
2017-09-19 09:08:09	keveloper	idk but im positive dave put it in the right place
2017-09-19 09:08:42	keveloper	its ui-mock-integration
2017-09-19 09:08:43	keveloper	not mock
2017-09-19 09:08:50	na_th_an	yeah I see tAT
2017-09-19 09:08:57	keveloper	tAT
2017-09-19 09:09:17	na_th_an	mhhmmm
2017-09-19 09:09:26	na_th_an	we really need to redefine what "Code freeze" is
2017-09-19 09:09:33	keveloper	i was having java uuid collision issues yesterday and was rly confused
2017-09-19 09:09:35	na_th_an	code freeze does not mean that testing is rcomplete
2017-09-19 09:09:45	keveloper	ya
2017-09-19 09:09:47	na_th_an	code freeze means that no new features are added to the release
2017-09-19 09:09:52	na_th_an	bug fixes, sure
2017-09-19 09:09:55	na_th_an	but not new features
2017-09-19 09:13:09	keveloper	cyndi
2017-09-19 09:13:10	keveloper	talk
2017-09-19 09:13:11	keveloper	quieter
2017-09-19 09:13:12	keveloper	jesus
2017-09-19 09:13:15	na_th_an	srsly
2017-09-19 09:13:46	keveloper	she just said "hashtag install husband"
2017-09-19 09:13:55	na_th_an	she faces away from me and i hear every word she says
2017-09-19 09:14:57	na_th_an	"do you see as to how"
2017-09-19 09:15:12	na_th_an	that's a solid rashmi-ism
2017-09-19 09:18:31	keveloper	abby just called spelling suggestinos done without even hearing what hakeem said yesterday lol
2017-09-19 09:18:40	keveloper	w/e
2017-09-19 09:49:21	na_th_an	the best thing about dave's pull requests is that there's a ton of completely unrelated changes because he's trying to reduce codenarc violations
2017-09-19 09:49:32	na_th_an	which is 100% the correct way to do code reviews
2017-09-19 09:50:32	keveloper	ugh
2017-09-19 09:50:37	keveloper	whats with the random added space
2017-09-19 09:50:42	keveloper	R E V I E W   U R   D I F F
2017-09-19 09:50:54	na_th_an	it's too big
2017-09-19 09:51:37	keveloper	so
2017-09-19 09:51:44	keveloper	i batched the sql requests to save time
2017-09-19 09:51:53	keveloper	then i parallelized the batches to save time
2017-09-19 09:51:56	keveloper	and it is faaast
2017-09-19 09:52:09	na_th_an	how fast now
2017-09-19 09:53:13	keveloper	2+ million lines in 3.3m
2017-09-19 09:53:24	keveloper	it was doing it in 3.7 minutes yesterday
2017-09-19 09:53:28	keveloper	then i _added_ a step
2017-09-19 09:53:32	keveloper	which slowed it down to 4 minutes
2017-09-19 09:53:44	keveloper	then i parallelized which sped it up to 3.2-3.3m
2017-09-19 09:53:56	na_th_an	nice
2017-09-19 09:54:10	keveloper	im playing with the batch size
2017-09-19 09:54:12	na_th_an	now what if instead of sqlite you have a postgresql cluster 
2017-09-19 09:54:22	na_th_an	have you tried mongodb
2017-09-19 09:54:26	na_th_an	i hear mongodb is the best
2017-09-19 09:55:15	keveloper	is sqlite slow
2017-09-19 09:55:22	keveloper	like obv a little slower but
2017-09-19 09:55:31	na_th_an	it's not the fastest thing in the world but i don't think it's regarded as slow
2017-09-19 09:55:36	na_th_an	i think it's generally considered p fast
2017-09-19 10:07:52	na_th_an	yt
2017-09-19 10:09:51	na_th_an	i have something to show you
2017-09-19 10:10:46	na_th_an	the ticket: https://jira.oclc.org/browse/DA-24712
2017-09-19 10:10:59	na_th_an	the pull request: http://git.ent.oclc.org/projects/ES/repos/up-user-portal/pull-requests/59/diff
2017-09-19 10:11:11	na_th_an	the QA estimate for the change: https://jira.oclc.org/browse/DA-24719
2017-09-19 10:16:57	na_th_an	finished an 8 hour ticket today
2017-09-19 10:16:59	na_th_an	can i go home now
2017-09-19 10:20:31	keveloper	hi
2017-09-19 10:20:40	na_th_an	hi
2017-09-19 10:21:13	keveloper	what a joke omg
2017-09-19 10:21:27	keveloper	holy shit

2017-09-19 10:21:42	na_th_an	and qa keeps saying they don't have enough time to test
2017-09-19 10:21:50	na_th_an	i've never seen them stay late to test
2017-09-19 10:21:51	keveloper	no wonder
2017-09-19 10:27:15	keveloper	an entire work day of sitting and verifying that buttons look different
2017-09-19 10:27:19	keveloper	8 hours
2017-09-19 10:28:16	na_th_an	I want to ask her to justify that estimate
2017-09-19 10:28:25	na_th_an	what test cases are you going to do for this ticket
2017-09-19 11:13:53	keveloper	nothing like parsing with a ton of splits yayy combinedPrependValue.split(' ').first().split('/').last().split('-').first()
2017-09-19 11:53:40	keveloper	DUI install canceled because
2017-09-19 11:53:44	keveloper	network team fucked up shockeerrr
2017-09-19 12:44:45	na_th_an	:O
2017-09-19 13:15:50	keveloper	how good are you at like buffer stream shit
2017-09-19 13:16:01	na_th_an	not
2017-09-19 13:16:05	keveloper	can you come help anyway
2017-09-19 13:16:10	na_th_an	:/

2017-09-19 13:17:20	keveloper	ok nvm
2017-09-19 13:18:42	keveloper	i think i fixed it
2017-09-19 13:18:52	keveloper	rip i ran out of heap space lol
2017-09-19 13:23:26	keveloper	omg it worked i did it
2017-09-19 13:23:50	keveloper	the script can now: read all files from a dir, read all files from a zip, read a file
2017-09-19 13:24:10	keveloper	so if you do
2017-09-19 13:24:11	keveloper	groovy analyzeLogs.groovy ~/combined.zip requestzip.db new combined
2017-09-19 13:24:29	keveloper	it unzip combined.zip and puts it in a build folder then parses the things it unzipped
2017-09-19 13:24:36	keveloper	and adds it to requestzip which is a new database
2017-09-19 13:24:44	keveloper	and parses it as an combined log file
2017-09-19 13:24:45	keveloper	\o/\o/\o/
2017-09-19 13:25:20	na_th_an	noice

2017-09-25 09:28:39	keveloper	(not really i kinda hate kickball)
2017-09-25 09:28:55	na_th_an	it would be more fun if you couldn't get people out by catching the ball
2017-09-25 09:29:01	na_th_an	i came to that conclusion
2017-09-25 09:29:16	keveloper	because everyone on our team just kicks it straight up?
2017-09-25 09:29:25	na_th_an	it's hard not to
2017-09-25 09:29:38	na_th_an	and it's hard to get it to go a decent distance

2017-09-25 10:49:24	keveloper	ok
2017-09-25 10:49:39	na_th_an	and one of the names for one of his beers was "split clit ale"

2017-09-25 10:49:50	keveloper	uh

2017-09-25 11:53:05	keveloper	rip

2017-09-25 13:10:58	keveloper	    private final oclcNo = '317923541'
2017-09-25 13:11:06	keveloper	ya thats how consts work good job gusy
2017-09-25 13:12:02	na_th_an	huh
2017-09-25 13:12:29	keveloper	a bunch of canned tests define constants like that
2017-09-25 13:13:12	na_th_an	I mean it's not not a constant
2017-09-25 13:13:22	keveloper	what
2017-09-25 13:13:29	keveloper	it's used a constant
2017-09-25 13:13:42	keveloper	but casing and no static
2017-09-25 13:17:25	na_th_an	well ya that's obviously not right
2017-09-26 09:19:54	keveloper	so they ran the fedramp audit thing on DC
2017-09-26 09:20:14	keveloper	and it turns out curry has to be rewritten
2017-09-26 09:20:17	keveloper	no just kidding
2017-09-26 09:20:18	keveloper	but
2017-09-26 09:20:32	keveloper	they found "hardcoded passwords" in source code
2017-09-26 09:20:38	keveloper	in a java file there was a password for RMS
2017-09-26 09:20:40	keveloper	so we removed
2017-09-26 09:20:41	keveloper	it
2017-09-26 09:20:53	keveloper	but in the same source code is a ton of properties files with the same password lol
2017-09-26 09:20:56	keveloper	but those didn't get flagged
2017-09-26 09:21:42	na_th_an	ok
2017-09-26 09:22:07	keveloper	yash was like
2017-09-26 09:22:16	keveloper	"but arent these in sourcecode too" and i was like "shhhhhhhh"
2017-09-26 09:22:49	na_th_an	i mean ideally you wouldn't have passwords in properties files either but it's better than java/groovy source code
2017-09-26 09:23:51	keveloper	omg massdebates is in ##learncss
2017-09-26 09:24:05	na_th_an	waaaat
2017-09-26 09:24:22	na_th_an	lol
2017-09-26 09:25:08	keveloper	he still spams giant walls of text
2017-09-26 09:26:21	na_th_an	i think i figured out why this hazelcast thing didn't work but idk how to fix it
2017-09-26 09:26:34	keveloper	well why
2017-09-26 09:27:23	na_th_an	because the health check doesn't trigger connection of the hazelcast instance
2017-09-26 09:27:29	na_th_an	it uses any existing hazelcast instance
2017-09-26 09:28:10	na_th_an	every time I bring up dui it seems to connect fine so idk why it didn't connect at first

2017-09-26 13:11:33	keveloper	he tried to create a new file in intellij but ended up adding the file name to the XML file type regex idfk how that happened
2017-09-26 13:11:37	keveloper	you click the little plus thing in settings
2017-09-26 13:11:42	keveloper	and he was in there when he left
2017-09-26 13:11:48	keveloper	so i think he wasnt paying attention and did that
2017-09-26 13:11:48	keveloper	idk
2017-09-26 13:11:58	keveloper	he didn't know how to build URL queries

2017-09-26 13:12:13	keveloper	"... no type an ampersand"
2017-09-26 13:12:40	na_th_an	now think of how long we interviewed and how he's the 2nd best person we talked to
2017-09-26 13:12:51	na_th_an	then think of how easy it should be for you to get another job
2017-09-26 13:12:53	keveloper	he spent a long time not figuring out why he was getting a 404 when had "dssrv-m1.dev.oclc.org//discovery-services......"
2017-09-26 13:13:05	keveloper	but i dont think im good at intereviews
2017-09-26 13:13:13	keveloper	we need to fucking sit down and pair with prospective employees
2017-09-26 13:13:17	keveloper	interviews are fucking useless
2017-09-26 13:13:22	keveloper	honestly we should pair with people
2017-09-26 13:13:32	keveloper	you learn so much about the skill of the other person
2017-09-26 13:13:44	keveloper	also he cloned wiremock and forgot where it was and lost it
2017-09-26 13:13:47	keveloper	and had to clone it again
2017-09-26 13:14:10	keveloper	i think he might have accidentally rm -rf'd it because it was in his history because he cloned it INSIDE DUI first so i told him to "rm rf it"
2017-09-26 13:14:11	keveloper	he was like
2017-09-26 13:14:13	keveloper	"what is that"
2017-09-26 13:14:16	keveloper	so i had to send him

2017-09-26 13:15:31	keveloper	i don't know if he really knows git or not idkk
2017-09-26 13:15:36	keveloper	he was confused when i said
2017-09-26 13:15:43	keveloper	"checkout this branch" and sent it to him
2017-09-26 13:15:46	keveloper	in slack
2017-09-26 13:15:53	keveloper	he pasted the branch name in firefox

2017-09-27 09:15:36	keveloper	brendon is very slow on computers it was driving me insane
2017-09-27 09:16:08	keveloper	and when I say stuff like "go to dui and do git status" and it takes him like 15 seconds to figure out that I mean go to the terminal and run a git command

2017-09-27 11:12:38	na_th_an	one thing I've noticed on this team is that most people half ass things so if you do a good job rashmi thinks that you're passionate 
2017-09-27 11:13:04	keveloper	ya
2017-09-27 11:13:24	keveloper	the only cool thing about permalinks was seeing 1) the number per week, 2) the world map

2017-09-27 11:29:48	keveloper	i told brendon to curl requests for wiremock instead of copying from browser because curl will properly encode xml and browser will not
2017-09-27 11:29:58	keveloper	and he didnt
2017-09-27 11:30:01	keveloper	and i didnt know
2017-09-27 11:30:15	keveloper	so we sat trying to debug shit for like 30 minutes until i realized it was because XML parsing erros

2017-09-28 09:57:43	keveloper	so
2017-09-28 09:57:51	keveloper	are you troubled by qa's catch up plan
2017-09-28 09:57:57	na_th_an	idgaf
2017-09-28 09:58:06	keveloper	and the fact that we are talking about developers helpiung
2017-09-28 09:58:13	na_th_an	yeah that's dumb af
2017-09-28 09:58:17	na_th_an	as dumb as this alerting shit
2017-09-28 09:58:24	keveloper	if developers _could_ help, and they expect the same quality
2017-09-28 09:58:41	keveloper	then obviously qa requires no training and developers could easily do their entire job
2017-09-28 09:58:42	keveloper	which i mean
2017-09-28 09:58:45	keveloper	is probably true
2017-09-28 09:58:50	keveloper	why is our qa such a joke
2017-09-28 09:58:52	keveloper	"catch up plan"
2017-09-28 09:58:55	keveloper	fucking work faster wtf
2017-09-28 09:59:03	keveloper	do we get a "catch up" plan when we are behind
2017-09-28 09:59:06	keveloper	no we just have to fucking finish i
2017-09-28 09:59:08	keveloper	it*
2017-09-28 09:59:11	keveloper	like what the actual fuck
2017-09-28 09:59:16	na_th_an	yeah this user portal stuff should take no more than a day to test
2017-09-28 09:59:16	keveloper	our qa is such a joek
2017-09-28 09:59:19	na_th_an	it's ridiculous
2017-09-28 09:59:35	keveloper	it is _EASY_
2017-09-28 09:59:47	keveloper	i did manual testing on shit for like 2+ years
2017-09-28 09:59:50	keveloper	it is EASY
2017-09-28 10:00:01	keveloper	cyndi and brett seem slow as fuck
2017-09-28 10:00:16	keveloper	we could hire interns and on board them and they'd be twice as fast because they grew up using the internet
2017-09-28 10:00:20	keveloper	why abby is fast
2017-09-28 10:00:38	keveloper	except for the fact that she doesn't have to be fast because everyone else is so slow
2017-09-28 10:01:46	keveloper	like in no circumstance ever
2017-09-28 10:01:50	keveloper	should qa take longer than dev
2017-09-28 10:01:53	keveloper	or even as long
2017-09-28 10:06:25	na_th_an	yeah it hurts to watch them try to use computers
2017-09-28 10:06:40	na_th_an	when I told brett to open a new window and copy and paste a url he was totally lost
2017-09-28 10:18:41	keveloper	ugh
2017-09-28 10:49:43	na_th_an	it seems like they make unnecessary work for themselves because they aren't good at their job so they don't know what they should test so they test everything
2017-09-28 10:49:53	keveloper	yeah
2017-09-28 10:49:59	keveloper	they are like actually bad
2017-09-28 10:50:01	keveloper	its infuriating
2017-09-28 10:50:08	na_th_an	like, these user portal UI changes did not need to be verified in ios, android, and ipad
2017-09-28 13:47:09	keveloper	Hey I'm asking Liz if we can split the referral :)
2017-09-28 13:47:26	na_th_an	you don't have to do that

2017-09-28 13:55:16	keveloper	she just uses camera and texts i think
2017-09-28 13:55:17	keveloper	maybe email
2017-09-28 13:55:20	keveloper	and googling
2017-09-28 13:55:22	na_th_an	it'd be better to get a mid-range phone that just came out
2017-09-28 13:55:27	keveloper	yeah

2017-09-28 13:55:32	na_th_an	better software support and security updates
2017-09-28 13:55:41	na_th_an	s6 isn't getting another update ever
2017-09-28 13:55:42	keveloper	how much is the s7 right now
2017-09-28 13:55:55	na_th_an	srsly look at mid range phones
2017-09-28 13:55:58	keveloper	k
2017-09-28 13:56:04	na_th_an	find one with a removable battery
2017-09-28 13:56:51	keveloper	https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Plus-5th-Generation-Lockscreen/dp/B01NBRN2YI
2017-09-28 13:57:31	keveloper	why removable battery
2017-09-28 13:57:48	na_th_an	because batteries get worse after a year or two but the phone is usually fine

2017-09-29 10:51:57	na_th_an	because she's abby

2017-09-29 11:18:32	na_th_an	wut
2017-10-03 11:28:49	keveloper	yo
2017-10-03 11:28:54	na_th_an	hi
2017-10-03 11:28:56	keveloper	so
2017-10-03 11:28:58	na_th_an	so
2017-10-03 11:29:00	keveloper	https://jira.oclc.org/browse/DA-25136
2017-10-03 11:29:02	keveloper	check out the estimate
2017-10-03 11:29:13	na_th_an	ok
2017-10-03 11:29:45	keveloper	it took 30 minutes of figuring out when the obsolete key thing happens, 2 minutes of thinking of any idea, 15 minutes of getting it to happen everytime on local and another 5 of fixing it on local
2017-10-03 11:29:53	keveloper	it's a 14 character fix
2017-10-03 11:30:06	na_th_an	lol time to spend 2 days fucking about with kotlin
2017-10-03 11:30:06	keveloper	idk who estimated this lol
2017-10-03 11:30:12	na_th_an	bryan i'm sure
2017-10-03 11:30:20	keveloper	yeah im definitely gonna milk it lol
2017-10-03 11:30:25	keveloper	there's actually some dashboard stuff i wanna do
2017-10-03 11:30:37	keveloper	yanno how it puts the failed output of a healthcheck in the modal
2017-10-03 11:30:46	na_th_an	ya
2017-10-03 11:30:53	keveloper	all health checks also return a requestId in the response header
2017-10-03 11:31:02	keveloper	which can be used to go check out exceptions in kibana
2017-10-03 11:31:13	keveloper	so what if there was a kibana link with the request id for the failed health check
2017-10-03 11:31:20	keveloper	right under the host name
2017-10-03 11:31:22	keveloper	and oyu could click it
2017-10-03 11:31:33	keveloper	and it'd open a new tab of kibana searching on the request id
2017-10-03 11:31:36	keveloper	p cool right
2017-10-03 11:31:59	na_th_an	that would be neat ya

2017-10-03 15:24:28	na_th_an	she definitely would have
2017-10-03 15:24:38	na_th_an	probably kibana related since you're passionate about dashboards

2017-10-10 10:27:31	na_th_an	best feeling
2017-10-10 10:27:34	na_th_an	best tech leadership
2017-10-10 10:27:51	keveloper	rashmi is trying to tell me her and bill made a security exception to allow all of our dev and nit hosts to talk to prod
2017-10-10 10:27:53	keveloper	...
2017-10-10 10:27:59	na_th_an	they did kinda
2017-10-10 10:28:02	na_th_an	i don't think we have it yet
2017-10-10 10:28:05	keveloper	ok what did they actually do
2017-10-10 10:28:19	na_th_an	but they're supposed to get a special host(s) or something to test the groovies
2017-10-10 10:28:23	na_th_an	because those need to use production data
2017-10-10 10:28:28	keveloper	okay...
2017-10-10 10:28:30	na_th_an	I don't think it's all of our hosts
2017-10-10 10:28:35	keveloper	because dev and nit cannot talk to prod im checking right now
2017-10-10 10:28:35	na_th_an	at least last I heard
2017-10-10 10:28:39	na_th_an	lol 
2017-10-10 10:28:41	keveloper	and no way in hell they would give us that exception
2017-10-10 10:28:48	na_th_an	maybe she's trying and thinks it'll happen because she's special
2017-10-10 10:28:54	keveloper	idk
2017-10-10 10:29:33	keveloper	yeah nope this does not work

2017-10-10 10:51:08	keveloper	we have fb's why do we need more
2017-10-10 11:03:29	na_th_an	because sometimes you need to set up multiple services for one ticket and ppl don't clean their shit up
2017-10-10 11:03:34	na_th_an	and testing takes forever sometimes
2017-10-10 12:36:57	keveloper	i cant even

2017-10-10 12:38:32	keveloper	she has some weird complex or something
2017-10-10 12:38:53	na_th_an	i'm completely serious when I say I think she's a sociopath
2017-10-10 12:38:58	na_th_an	the more I think about it the more I think she is
2017-10-10 12:39:01	keveloper	lines up
2017-10-10 12:39:13	na_th_an	sociopathy is more common than a lot of peolpe think
2017-10-10 12:39:41	keveloper	definition sounds like rashmi
2017-10-10 12:39:47	keveloper	a lot of it is just self awareness
2017-10-10 12:39:53	na_th_an	yeah
2017-10-10 12:39:55	keveloper	being able to realize you aren't good at something
2017-10-10 12:40:07	keveloper	whats the thing where you have to have a certain level of competence to realize your incompetence
2017-10-10 12:40:12	keveloper	that's her with photography
2017-10-10 12:40:28	keveloper	idk i feel like i can tell when im bad at things
2017-10-10 12:40:55	keveloper	ppl are like "you are good at anything you do" and im like "no i only do things im good at"
2017-10-10 12:41:06	keveloper	i seldom do things im bad at and when i realize im bad at them i stop doing it lol
2017-10-10 15:15:38	na_th_an	interesting
2017-10-10 15:15:46	na_th_an	that email dave sent about code reviews
2017-10-10 15:15:51	na_th_an	he CC'd bill and dan but not rashmi
2017-10-10 15:23:45	na_th_an	lisa olsen didn't know who I was

2017-10-10 15:50:39	na_th_an	the lowest hanging fruit of code reviews: complaining about javadoc
2017-10-10 15:51:02	keveloper	who
2017-10-10 15:51:10	keveloper	who did it
2017-10-10 15:51:53	na_th_an	harika

2017-10-10 15:59:13	keveloper	is it null on new searches
2017-10-10 15:59:23	na_th_an	i don't know
2017-10-10 20:38:36	keveloper	yt
2017-10-10 20:38:45	keveloper	network completely fucked the actual DR pool
2017-10-10 20:38:54	keveloper	so now we have a bridge call before this install
2017-10-10 21:24:39	na_th_an	you still there
2017-10-10 21:38:12	keveloper	yeah
2017-10-10 21:38:13	keveloper	you>

2017-10-10 21:38:19	keveloper	just now starting install
2017-10-10 21:38:24	keveloper	38 minutes late
2017-10-10 21:38:46	keveloper	There are 3 DR pools, 2 of which exist for no reason
2017-10-10 21:38:48	keveloper	they are duplicates
2017-10-10 21:38:58	keveloper	but me and jennifer were like "yeah lets not change this"
2017-10-10 21:39:06	na_th_an	how's it going
2017-10-10 21:39:08	na_th_an	did they fix it

2017-10-10 21:42:57	keveloper	this wouldve been so bad if i didnt go check the pools
2017-10-10 21:43:12	keveloper	we wouldn't have known until 01 and 02 hosts were dying in a wall of requests lol
2017-10-10 21:43:20	na_th_an	lol 
2017-10-10 21:43:23	na_th_an	rip
2017-10-10 21:43:30	keveloper	any requests to DR through teh worldcat farm wouldve been only using 01 and 02
2017-10-10 21:43:36	keveloper	and the install woudlve been successful
2017-10-10 21:43:41	na_th_an	god why are they so bad
2017-10-10 21:43:49	na_th_an	i get that this shit happened a few times
2017-10-10 21:43:51	na_th_an	but every goddamn time
2017-10-10 21:44:42	keveloper	but like
2017-10-10 21:44:49	keveloper	if anyone else except maybe you was running this install
2017-10-10 21:44:54	keveloper	it wouldve happened i guarentee
2017-10-10 21:45:13	keveloper	nobody else wouldve checked the pool before the install
2017-10-10 21:46:37	keveloper	dr install running what are the chance that it will fail
2017-10-10 21:56:02	na_th_an	did it fail
2017-10-10 22:00:38	keveloper	no it worked
2017-10-10 22:00:41	keveloper	almost done
2017-10-10 22:03:32	na_th_an	\o/ dank
2017-10-10 22:06:26	keveloper	cancelling
2017-10-10 22:06:29	keveloper	DR is using port 17000
2017-10-10 22:06:31	keveloper	DS***
2017-10-10 22:06:43	keveloper	DS is pointing to port 17000 instead of 80
2017-10-10 22:06:44	na_th_an	what
2017-10-10 22:06:50	na_th_an	for the farm
2017-10-10 22:06:51	keveloper	ying literally changed this 2 weeks ago
2017-10-10 22:06:57	na_th_an	oh nice
2017-10-10 22:06:59	keveloper	yeah the old farm used 17000
2017-10-10 22:07:05	na_th_an	nice nice 
2017-10-10 22:07:06	keveloper	ying changed dr to use 80
2017-10-10 22:07:09	keveloper	and didn't change DS prod
2017-10-10 22:07:11	keveloper	to 80
2017-10-10 22:08:48	keveloper	........
2017-10-10 22:09:19	na_th_an	isn't the old farm supposed to work too
2017-10-10 22:09:33	keveloper	it changed from 17000 to 80
2017-10-10 22:09:53	na_th_an	the old farm?
2017-10-10 22:10:09	keveloper	deliveryresolver.prod.oclc.org
2017-10-10 22:10:11	keveloper	both -m1 and not
2017-10-10 22:10:18	na_th_an	what that seems wrong
2017-10-10 22:10:42	na_th_an	so did we install everything that uses dr along with this to change what they use
2017-10-10 22:12:17	keveloper	no
2017-10-10 22:12:25	keveloper	i didnt know the port change wasn't installed yet
2017-10-10 22:12:45	na_th_an	i guess i don't understand why it failed
2017-10-10 22:12:49	keveloper	i can't believe ying didn't fix the port else where omg
2017-10-10 22:13:01	keveloper	17000 is not allowed to be a farm port anymore i guess
2017-10-10 22:13:13	keveloper	so the old dsdc farm was basically turned off
2017-10-10 22:13:15	na_th_an	yeah but shouldn't that still work through the old farm
2017-10-10 22:13:20	na_th_an	old farm is 17000
2017-10-10 22:13:22	na_th_an	new farm is 80
2017-10-10 22:13:27	keveloper	okay so
2017-10-10 22:13:35	na_th_an	otherwise we'd have to change what ds uses 
2017-10-10 22:13:35	keveloper	there are 2 deliveryresolver.prod farms
2017-10-10 22:13:38	na_th_an	and that requires an install
2017-10-10 22:13:43	keveloper	one is 80 one is 17000
2017-10-10 22:13:47	na_th_an	oh
2017-10-10 22:13:50	keveloper	we are not allowed to use 17000 anymore
2017-10-10 22:13:56	keveloper	the 17000 farm has one pool of the legacy hosts in it
2017-10-10 22:13:58	na_th_an	i didn't know there were 2 old prod farms
2017-10-10 22:14:10	keveloper	when we deactivated those hosts, the pool became inactive
2017-10-10 22:14:42	keveloper	so any 17100 traffic
2017-10-10 22:14:50	na_th_an	i feel like network should be able to make that work but ok
2017-10-10 22:15:59	keveloper	gimme an elink to test
2017-10-10 22:16:11	keveloper	we cant use 17100 anymore so
2017-10-10 22:16:12	na_th_an	uhhh i actually can one sec
2017-10-10 22:16:19	na_th_an	oh from dui?

2017-10-10 22:16:58	na_th_an	that should show an ebook button
2017-10-10 22:17:01	na_th_an	ya
2017-10-10 22:17:06	na_th_an	that first result should have an ebook
2017-10-10 22:17:06	keveloper	that uses the elink hosts right
2017-10-10 22:17:11	na_th_an	i think so
2017-10-10 22:17:16	keveloper	uhhhh
2017-10-10 22:17:18	na_th_an	maybe not
2017-10-10 22:17:20	na_th_an	idk really
2017-10-10 22:17:35	keveloper	oh wait
2017-10-10 22:17:44	keveloper	dui calls dr dr calls itself in elink
2017-10-10 22:17:45	keveloper	i forgot
2017-10-10 22:17:57	na_th_an	yeah it calls itself with localhost i think
2017-10-10 22:18:42	keveloper	how the fuck did ying not change this UGHHH
2017-10-10 22:25:16	keveloper	k elinks are back

2017-10-10 22:31:09	keveloper	lol
2017-10-10 22:31:11	keveloper	jim
2017-10-10 22:31:19	keveloper	feel like jim is worse than ying
2017-10-10 22:31:51	na_th_an	oh totally
2017-10-10 22:31:54	na_th_an	no doubt
2017-10-10 22:31:57	na_th_an	i was just memeing
2017-10-10 22:32:19	na_th_an	i'm expirementing with docker
2017-10-10 22:32:22	na_th_an	docker is future
2017-10-10 22:32:24	keveloper	hows that
2017-10-10 22:32:25	keveloper	rly
2017-10-10 22:32:30	na_th_an	i mean sorta
2017-10-10 22:32:31	keveloper	fast installs right
2017-10-10 22:32:32	na_th_an	it's pretty neat
2017-10-10 22:32:33	keveloper	just like
2017-10-10 22:32:50	na_th_an	I've never made my own docker before
2017-10-10 22:32:50	keveloper	poof and its there in a little happy env
2017-10-10 22:33:03	na_th_an	i wanna make a docker that will start up ascient frontend and backend and run the ui tests
2017-10-10 22:33:16	keveloper	does docker handle ci
2017-10-10 22:33:17	na_th_an	or at least frontend and backend
2017-10-10 22:33:24	na_th_an	you can use docker with ci
2017-10-10 22:33:25	keveloper	docker is like a virtualizationg thing right
2017-10-10 22:33:31	na_th_an	it's containers
2017-10-10 22:33:33	keveloper	ye
2017-10-10 22:33:36	na_th_an	which is like virtualization
2017-10-10 22:33:42	na_th_an	but different but not really but it is
2017-10-10 22:33:48	keveloper	wa
2017-10-10 22:35:00	na_th_an	it's like virtualization
2017-10-10 22:35:03	na_th_an	but it's not
2017-10-10 22:35:15	na_th_an	but for a lot of purposes it's the same
2017-10-10 22:35:21	na_th_an	but no performance penalty
2017-10-10 22:35:33	keveloper	neaaato
2017-10-10 22:35:45	keveloper	do you even need docker with java appps
2017-10-10 22:36:30	na_th_an	less so than for some other platforms but it can still be useful
2017-10-10 22:36:37	na_th_an	like i could make an ascient docker and publish it to dockerhub
2017-10-10 22:36:49	na_th_an	then anyone with unraid could install it with a gui ezpz
2017-10-10 22:36:56	keveloper	ezpz u say
2017-10-10 22:36:59	na_th_an	or anyone could just download and run ad not care about anything
2017-10-10 22:37:17	keveloper	but do they care about their sister
2017-10-10 22:37:18	keveloper	or their dog

2017-10-12 10:08:15	na_th_an	and told him it's probably firefox not connecting 
2017-10-12 10:08:17	na_th_an	and phantomjs is
2017-10-12 10:08:20	na_th_an	which is why thta works
2017-10-12 10:08:26	na_th_an	and he's like "timeoutexception"
2017-10-12 10:08:32	na_th_an	I asked what he was connecting to and he never said anyhting
2017-10-12 10:08:35	na_th_an	>_>

2017-10-12 10:08:58	keveloper	i was like "how you know about pernt"
2017-10-12 10:09:05	keveloper	and massdebates was like "i know about pernt too" what is happening
2017-10-12 10:17:52	keveloper	k the first guy found it from me sending him a single codepen lol
2017-10-12 10:18:00	keveloper	so apparently i have linked my stuff together pretty well
2017-10-12 10:18:17	na_th_an	lol
2017-10-12 10:19:51	keveloper	lol find was trying to fix the partial results thing
2017-10-12 10:19:55	keveloper	and broke perf
2017-10-12 10:20:00	na_th_an	sigh
2017-10-12 10:21:25	keveloper	rashmi told me to point discovery at pte
2017-10-12 10:21:27	keveloper	i was like
2017-10-12 10:21:29	keveloper	wut
2017-10-12 10:21:42	na_th_an	lolwat
2017-10-12 10:21:57	na_th_an	i think it's because find doesn't have nat
2017-10-12 10:22:01	na_th_an	they call their nat equiv prt
2017-10-12 10:22:19	keveloper	but anyway she wants me to basically install an entire discovery env on fb's
2017-10-12 10:22:20	keveloper	http://firefly-m1.nat.oclc.org/firefly-service/rs/sru/
2017-10-12 10:22:27	na_th_an	we don't have that many free
2017-10-12 10:22:29	keveloper	yeah firefly points to find pte is probably what it is
2017-10-12 10:22:31	keveloper	i know
2017-10-12 10:25:10	keveloper	lol
2017-10-12 10:25:26	keveloper	ok so the only thing that needs to be tested is lac and thats not even for this release
2017-10-12 10:25:30	keveloper	soo
2017-10-12 10:26:20	na_th_an	lol
2017-10-12 10:26:27	keveloper	dope closure bro

2017-10-12 10:28:38	keveloper	you look annoyed
2017-10-12 10:28:47	na_th_an	i asked if webpack was still in this release
2017-10-12 10:28:53	na_th_an	and she's like "yeah but that only has 8 hours on it"
2017-10-12 10:28:54	na_th_an	I'm like lol
2017-10-12 10:28:58	na_th_an	maybe 3 months ago
2017-10-12 10:29:14	na_th_an	also apparently I get to work on some reporting bullshit for CSD that's going to be a pain in teh ass
2017-10-12 10:29:27	na_th_an	the coding for it won't be bad
2017-10-12 10:29:31	na_th_an	but the organizational shit will
2017-10-12 10:29:48	na_th_an	like rashmi might want some service we can start from quickbuild that'll produce a report and put it in a mysql db 
2017-10-12 10:29:51	na_th_an	for each environment
2017-10-12 10:29:52	keveloper	are you not passionate about  r e p o r t i n g
2017-10-12 10:30:04	na_th_an	csd wants to know a bunch of shit about wclconfigs and stuff
2017-10-12 10:30:19	na_th_an	and since it's in fucking firefly as a blob we can't do any of that without downloading and parsing them all
2017-10-12 10:30:24	na_th_an	fuck rdbms why use em
2017-10-12 10:31:01	keveloper	lol
2017-10-12 10:31:16	keveloper	why you
2017-10-12 10:31:44	na_th_an	idfk
2017-10-12 10:32:05	na_th_an	honestly because i get things done fast and can actually understand what ppl are saying and get things done 
2017-10-12 10:32:15	na_th_an	so she gets these plans in her head of what she wants done
2017-10-12 10:32:25	na_th_an	then uses me to accomplish them because I'm usually more free because I actually get things done
2017-10-12 10:32:42	na_th_an	charles and rich are the only other ppl that report to her that can actually do things
2017-10-12 10:32:55	na_th_an	like complicated things
2017-10-12 10:32:59	na_th_an	without help/direction
2017-10-12 10:33:27	keveloper	welp if you you need wclconfig help im ur dood
2017-10-12 10:33:44	na_th_an	i love the part of DS where it takes a ton of parameters to a @RequestMapping method
2017-10-12 10:33:46	na_th_an	then puts them in a map
2017-10-12 10:33:49	na_th_an	calls a method with that map
2017-10-12 10:33:56	na_th_an	then takes all the parameters out of that map
2017-10-12 10:34:16	keveloper	love it
2017-10-12 10:35:47	keveloper	so the only activity in groovy so far is someone saying "well"
2017-10-12 10:35:55	keveloper	after i said "and apparently inactive :O"
2017-10-12 10:36:00	keveloper	you should join

2017-10-12 14:54:47	na_th_an	also i feel like it would be fun to drink with chris and talk about how fucked the find team is but chris is weird so I don't think it would actually be fun
2017-10-12 14:55:00	na_th_an	if he wasn't tho it would be fun
2017-10-12 14:55:04	na_th_an	i wonder what it's like

2017-10-12 16:05:31	na_th_an	but I think cucumber is a terrible idea
2017-10-13 09:28:40	keveloper	so the install script versions were off by one
2017-10-13 09:28:42	keveloper	in the change now
2017-10-13 09:28:54	keveloper	and instead of being like "fixed plz redeploy"
2017-10-13 09:28:56	keveloper	he has to
2017-10-13 09:29:02	keveloper	Drop the tickets back into draft
2017-10-13 09:29:02	keveloper	Have prodcon execute the deploys for these three tickets – to verify they’re correct.
2017-10-13 09:29:02	keveloper	Edit the tickets for the new version number
2017-10-13 09:29:02	keveloper	Resubmit the tickets ‘expedited’ with executive approval

2017-10-16 12:55:00	na_th_an	imo no bc i don't want manufacturers to think that removing the headphone jack is ok 
2017-10-16 12:55:06	na_th_an	but that's my opinion
2017-10-16 12:55:08	keveloper	lol
2017-10-16 12:55:21	keveloper	k besides that
2017-10-16 12:55:36	keveloper	imagine it had a headphone jack
2017-10-16 12:55:54	na_th_an	idk, it's expensive and doesn't have a whole lot of features over a mid range phone
2017-10-16 12:56:05	na_th_an	but it's nice and you can spend your money how you want
2017-10-16 12:56:20	na_th_an	you're mostly paying for software updates
2017-10-16 13:38:53	keveloper	sup

2017-10-16 13:40:10	na_th_an	i think it might predate memes even
2017-10-16 13:40:16	keveloper	ya
2017-10-16 13:40:20	na_th_an	it's a proto-meme
2017-10-16 13:40:37	keveloper	preme
2017-10-16 13:40:55	keveloper	remember when find used to work
2017-10-16 13:41:03	na_th_an	not really
2017-10-16 13:41:23	keveloper	so long ago
2017-10-16 13:41:43	keveloper	cant believe AQ unit tests hit live urls
2017-10-16 13:42:11	na_th_an	ya great development
2017-10-16 13:42:19	keveloper	like wat
2017-10-16 13:42:35	na_th_an	the best part is how nobody who has worekd on aq has bothered to fix it
2017-10-16 13:43:13	keveloper	i need a haircut
2017-10-16 13:43:15	keveloper	its annoying
2017-10-16 13:44:26	na_th_an	i know the feel
2017-10-16 14:44:54	keveloper	i just have a hard time believing that lol
2017-10-16 14:44:58	keveloper	idk why
2017-10-16 14:45:13	na_th_an	idk i'm starting to think she's just not that smart when it comes to day to day things
2017-10-16 14:45:19	na_th_an	she hurts herself a lot
2017-10-16 14:45:25	na_th_an	and doesn't understand money at all
2017-10-16 14:46:56	keveloper	idk how much of it is her trying to seem cute or something
2017-10-16 14:46:59	keveloper	because i feel like she does that
2017-10-16 14:47:07	keveloper	tries to seem like funny and cute by not knowing things or something idk
2017-10-16 14:47:21	na_th_an	the most attractive quality in a lady
2017-10-16 14:50:14	keveloper	idk but
2017-10-16 14:50:29	keveloper	tbf if she did trip and hit her head that's a lot of momentum
2017-10-16 14:50:45	na_th_an	depending on how you hit it ya
2017-10-16 14:51:42	keveloper	idk but hitting the front of your head is pretty hard to get a concussion from
2017-10-16 14:52:24	na_th_an	i mean i doubt she went to the doctor
2017-10-16 14:52:35	na_th_an	she's probably like "oh I hit my head == concussion == stay home"
2017-10-16 14:53:02	keveloper	yeah
2017-10-16 14:53:13	keveloper	idk
2017-10-16 14:53:26	keveloper	she's sick sooo often
2017-10-16 14:53:30	na_th_an	srsly
2017-10-16 14:53:33	keveloper	its ridiculous
2017-10-16 14:53:34	na_th_an	that's part of why rashmi didn't want to hire her
2017-10-16 14:53:38	keveloper	really lol
2017-10-16 14:53:43	na_th_an	ya
2017-10-16 14:53:44	keveloper	whats the other part
2017-10-16 14:53:59	na_th_an	i got the vibe that rashmi thinks abby is lazy and/or stubborn
2017-10-16 14:54:03	keveloper	yeeeah
2017-10-16 14:54:10	keveloper	idk if she's lazy
2017-10-16 14:54:13	keveloper	but qa hasn't helped
2017-10-16 14:54:27	keveloper	people have less responsibilites than a preschooler amirite
2017-10-16 14:54:43	na_th_an	honestly there are 14 year olds that could do what our qa does
2017-10-16 14:54:51	keveloper	yeah
2017-10-16 14:54:54	keveloper	for sure
2017-10-16 14:55:05	na_th_an	read acceptance requirements -> make test case -> do test case
2017-10-16 14:55:25	keveloper	we could hire 18 year olds out of high school and train them and have them do QA's job for half the cost
2017-10-16 14:55:33	na_th_an	honestly yeah we could
2017-10-16 14:55:36	keveloper	you dont need a college education for that
2017-10-16 14:55:45	keveloper	its brainless
2017-10-16 14:55:58	keveloper	coming from somebody who did manual qa for like a year
2017-10-16 14:56:18	keveloper	can't believe abby makes as much as us
2017-10-16 14:56:19	keveloper	it's insane
2017-10-16 14:56:21	keveloper	honestly
2017-10-16 14:56:28	keveloper	the amount of value we prodive compared to her lol
2017-10-16 14:56:43	keveloper	prodive
2017-10-16 14:56:57	na_th_an	yeah it's really pretty absurd
2017-10-16 14:57:02	na_th_an	especially considering we're on call
2017-10-16 14:57:06	keveloper	yep
2017-10-16 14:57:22	keveloper	she has not worked a 40 hour week in months im sure

2017-10-16 14:57:30	na_th_an	dude i know
2017-10-16 14:57:40	na_th_an	then she "works" a 2 hour install
2017-10-16 14:57:45	na_th_an	and takes 2 hours off the next day

2017-10-16 15:05:08	keveloper	$70k for a 2015 911 with 18k miles 25 miles from LA seems a lil sketch lol
2017-10-16 15:05:13	keveloper	wonder if he checked carfax
2017-10-16 15:05:22	keveloper	or maybe the dealership just couldnt sell and he got lucky
2017-10-16 15:12:03	na_th_an	tfw you're so rich you don't know what carfax is

2017-10-16 16:02:52	keveloper	to pass and shoot
2017-10-16 16:03:03	keveloper	and you can like deflect the ball with a shield thing

2017-10-16 21:41:22	keveloper	you ahve to activate dui for it to work
2017-10-16 21:41:25	keveloper	because it uses hosts
2017-10-16 21:41:26	keveloper	rip
2017-10-16 21:41:41	keveloper	and you have to reactivate for it to get the new hosts
2017-10-16 21:41:45	na_th_an	:o yeah
