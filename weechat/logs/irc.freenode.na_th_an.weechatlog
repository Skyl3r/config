I don't want to be in class either and I have homework I need to do tonight, but I'm here. It's not okay to miss classes and not say anything on a team project.

2015-11-19 11:16:44	na_th_an	The sexual connotations of the phrase "make out" appear to have developed in the 1930s and 1940s from the phrase's other meanings of "to succeed". Originally, it meant "to seduce" or "to have sexual intercourse with".[4]

2015-11-19 22:58:19	frappuccino	SBT (scala build tool) is like mvn, activator is a layer on top of that that includes play

2015-11-19 23:06:23	frappuccino	school plus another job
2015-11-19 23:06:33	frappuccino	mike said some mean comment about his resume
2015-11-19 23:06:37	frappuccino	i think it was supposed to be a joke
2015-11-19 23:06:42	frappuccino	but it did not seem like one lol
2015-11-19 23:07:05	na_th_an	do you know what it was
2015-11-19 23:07:13	frappuccino	yeah
2015-11-19 23:07:21	frappuccino	so he put costumer support on his resume on accient
2015-11-19 23:07:25	frappuccino	instead of customer
2015-11-19 23:07:25	na_th_an	mike's humor is pretty abrasive
2015-11-19 23:07:28	frappuccino	so mike pointed that out
2015-11-19 23:07:48	na_th_an	how did he point it out
2015-11-19 23:07:53	na_th_an	did he ask about his costuming experience
2015-11-19 23:07:54	frappuccino	and quinton was like "oh no! i changed that I swear! I might have lost the change when I was condensing it down from 2 pages to 1 page"
2015-11-19 23:07:57	na_th_an	because that would be fucking hilarious
2015-11-19 23:08:12	frappuccino	and mike was like "oh was the 2 page one the version where you tell us what you've done"
2015-11-19 23:08:19	frappuccino	implying that his resume sucked
2015-11-19 23:08:30	frappuccino	i forget the exact wording, quintons wording of it sounded harsher
2015-11-19 23:08:36	na_th_an	I'm literally laughing my ass off
2015-11-19 23:08:51	frappuccino	okay maybe for you because youve worked here and know mike
2015-11-19 23:08:52	na_th_an	he probably did think the resume was bad then
2015-11-19 23:08:55	frappuccino	but in an interview
2015-11-19 23:08:59	na_th_an	but I wouldn't worry about it
2015-11-19 23:09:03	frappuccino	hes in college lol
2015-11-19 23:09:05	frappuccino	he has a dev internship
2015-11-19 23:09:08	frappuccino	like its not a bad resume
2015-11-19 23:09:18	na_th_an	I never saw it so I can't say
2015-11-19 23:09:39	frappuccino	idk
2015-11-19 23:09:44	frappuccino	thats unnecssary to say
2015-11-19 23:09:50	na_th_an	no it kinda is
2015-11-19 23:09:55	na_th_an	I bet patrick said something to mike after about it
2015-11-19 23:09:57	na_th_an	amybe
2015-11-19 23:09:58	na_th_an	maybe
2015-11-19 23:10:06	frappuccino	quinton said there was like "heh" kinda laughs
2015-11-19 23:10:08	na_th_an	but that doesn't make it any less funny
2015-11-19 23:10:10	frappuccino	like it was very uncomfortable
2015-11-19 23:10:13	na_th_an	hmm
2015-11-19 23:10:20	na_th_an	who else was in it do you know
2015-11-19 23:10:21	frappuccino	but like it was supposed to be aj oke
2015-11-19 23:10:26	frappuccino	patrick and bill
2015-11-19 23:10:33	na_th_an	just those three?
2015-11-19 23:10:38	frappuccino	yeah
2015-11-19 23:10:48	frappuccino	btw one of my profs was like "people still use irc?" lol
2015-11-19 23:10:57	na_th_an	I think there's like a kinda weird dynamic where mike and pat's humor doesn't mix at all
2015-11-19 23:11:06	frappuccino	yeah i agree
2015-11-19 23:11:08	na_th_an	pat would make jokes and I would get them and be the only one
2015-11-19 23:11:14	frappuccino	patrick is great
2015-11-19 23:11:18	na_th_an	and I'd look at him and we'd exchange a look like "really only us get that"
2015-11-19 23:11:26	na_th_an	while mike would just keep talking
2015-11-19 23:11:48	frappuccino	jetbrains site has a little terminal that pops up in the bottom right for if you need help lol
2015-11-19 23:11:55	na_th_an	lol

2015-11-19 23:12:43	frappuccino	thats pretty uninterested

2015-11-19 23:13:32	na_th_an	the way you make it sound
2015-11-19 23:13:45	na_th_an	the "nah you're cool" is like a "nah you're cool keep talking" kind of thing
2015-11-19 23:13:59	na_th_an	when melissa first started talking to me she's like "sorry I keep talking I can let you go"
2015-11-19 23:14:03	na_th_an	and I'm like "no you're fine"
2015-11-19 23:14:10	na_th_an	I feel like it's that

2015-12-11 15:23:32	na_th_an	but no you didn't
2015-12-11 15:23:34	frappuccino	or
2015-12-11 15:23:35	frappuccino	whatever
2015-12-11 15:23:42	na_th_an	it's 12
2015-12-11 15:23:42	frappuccino	so
2015-12-11 15:23:49	na_th_an	window 12
2015-12-11 15:24:01	frappuccino	when people search for the country "deutschland" in IR it needs to search for germany
2015-12-11 15:24:08	na_th_an	yeah
2015-12-11 15:24:13	frappuccino	those are called synonyms i guess
2015-12-11 15:24:21	na_th_an	ok
2015-12-11 15:24:26	frappuccino	so someone implemented that recently in FIND and its awful
2015-12-11 15:24:32	na_th_an	k
2015-12-11 15:24:52	frappuccino	so i had to write a script to go through a file of synonyms and search all of them in FIND and check for the country code that I parsed out of a file and it was so fun
2015-12-11 15:25:17	frappuccino	it even writes logs to a directory that is timestamped and then there is are log,pass,fail,skip files
2015-12-11 15:25:47	frappuccino	i wrote a cool logger that puts everything in the log and to the terminal, and then sorts out the passes/fails/skips and puts those in their own log files
2015-12-11 15:25:54	na_th_an	neat
2015-12-11 15:25:54	frappuccino	and then the master log file has everything
2015-12-11 15:25:57	frappuccino	its so cool
2015-12-11 15:26:00	na_th_an	java?

2016-01-05 14:59:21	na_th_an	and I said that I wrote that I really liked her but figured nothing would probably happen between us
2016-01-05 14:59:25	na_th_an	I'm trying to journal more, yeah
2016-01-05 14:59:31	na_th_an	but anyway I said that to her
2016-01-05 14:59:35	frappuccino	does she know why
2016-01-05 14:59:37	na_th_an	and she looks down and goes "yeah... probably"
2016-01-05 14:59:47	na_th_an	and talked about how she was probably gonna stay with adam
2016-01-05 14:59:55	na_th_an	she's in new york with him right now
2016-01-05 15:00:01	frappuccino	this is dumb
2016-01-05 15:00:04	na_th_an	yeah
2016-01-05 15:00:27	na_th_an	I guess she did send me a snap last night but it was just a picture of extra credit from high school like "wasn't that nice back then"
2016-01-05 15:01:09	na_th_an	so yeah I doubt anything will happen with her despite how much I want something to happen
2016-01-05 15:01:33	na_th_an	I have a couple tinder matches that I haven't tried to message
2016-01-05 15:01:55	na_th_an	one match who messaged back once, and one match who never messaged back
2016-01-05 15:01:57	na_th_an	and that's my life
2016-01-05 15:03:11	frappuccino	well
2016-01-05 15:03:22	frappuccino	i dont like tinder
2016-01-05 15:03:26	frappuccino	i dont think its very effective
2016-01-05 15:03:34	na_th_an	I'm not going to meet anyone any other way any time soon
2016-01-05 15:03:46	frappuccino	i know right

2016-01-05 15:04:35	frappuccino	its probably not a good idea
2016-01-05 15:04:41	frappuccino	i feel like im in too deep though
2016-01-05 15:04:45	na_th_an	it isn't a good idea and you know it
2016-01-05 15:05:02	frappuccino	its going pretty well so far...
2016-01-05 15:05:15	frappuccino	she came to my friends house on new years eve and just sat there pissed off
2016-01-05 15:05:29	frappuccino	so i was texting her like "whats wrong is everything okay?" and she never responded
2016-01-05 15:05:32	frappuccino	but was texting other people
2016-01-05 15:06:01	frappuccino	and i would like try to talk to her and she would be really rude
2016-01-05 15:06:02	frappuccino	idk
2016-01-05 15:06:22	na_th_an	sounds healthy
2016-01-05 15:06:27	na_th_an	like other stories you've told me about her
2016-01-05 15:06:48	frappuccino	she got mad at me for going on a date someone while we werent talking
2016-01-05 15:07:00	na_th_an	also healthy and a good thing
2016-01-05 15:07:39	frappuccino	then that girl randomly snapchatted me and lindsey got mad
2016-01-05 15:07:46	frappuccino	and she was like "its obvious you like her"
2016-01-05 15:07:50	frappuccino	and i was like "no i dont"
2016-01-05 15:08:13	frappuccino	the snapchat was a star wars movie and it said "finally"
2016-01-05 15:08:25	frappuccino	because one time i gave her shit for not seeing starwars
2016-01-05 15:08:44	frappuccino	but anyway so lindsey was like "you guys are obviously still talking" and i was like "well she's not so"
2016-01-05 15:08:48	frappuccino	we're not*
2016-01-05 15:09:23	frappuccino	she didn't even ask any questions first, she saw the snapchat and went straight to "fuck you why are you talking to her" and i was like "what"
2016-01-05 15:10:05	na_th_an	:(
2016-01-05 15:10:14	frappuccino	its very demeaning

2016-01-05 15:10:48	frappuccino	there's still that one time when she told me she was going to run her car off the road and it would be my fault
2016-01-05 15:11:00	na_th_an	yeah you really need to cut contact with her

2016-01-05 15:12:24	frappuccino	she also really likes revenge
2016-01-05 15:12:47	frappuccino	during the "why is she snapchatting you" thing she added some guy that asked her on a date and texted him
2016-01-05 15:12:51	frappuccino	for revenge
2016-01-05 15:13:10	frappuccino	i don't know how to get out of it

2016-01-05 15:14:47	na_th_an	I drank a LOT last semester
2016-01-05 15:14:59	na_th_an	I learned I can drink a fifth of booze in 2 days
2016-01-05 15:15:43	frappuccino	thats not a good thing
2016-01-05 15:16:04	na_th_an	in some ways it is
2016-01-05 15:16:06	frappuccino	everytime i try to end it she freaks out
2016-01-05 15:16:10	frappuccino	i need to like
2016-01-05 15:16:12	frappuccino	write a note
2016-01-05 15:16:16	frappuccino	she always takes over arguments
2016-01-05 15:16:25	na_th_an	text her or leave a message
2016-01-05 15:16:28	frappuccino	its not a like a take turns kind of argument
2016-01-05 15:16:31	na_th_an	then block her number and block her on facebook
2016-01-05 15:16:37	na_th_an	cut contact with her
2016-01-05 15:16:41	na_th_an	seriously
2016-01-05 15:16:46	frappuccino	this is frustrating though

2016-01-05 15:29:50	frappuccino	 did you know that your iPhone is actually manufactured by Samsung? Every single hardware part and your phone aside from the camera sensor is Samsung technology 
2016-01-05 15:29:53	frappuccino	lol
2016-01-05 15:29:59	na_th_an	lol
2016-01-05 15:30:01	frappuccino	pseudofact

2016-01-05 15:33:57	frappuccino	Really not in the mood to deal with you doing something that you know pisses me off so I gotta go, bye  
2016-01-05 15:34:04	frappuccino	because i said "lol"
2016-01-05 15:34:10	frappuccino	she gets mad when i say "lol" in a text
2016-01-05 15:34:27	frappuccino	well not lol in a text but a text that is "lol"
2016-01-05 15:34:28	frappuccino	you get it
2016-01-05 15:35:41	na_th_an	to take a line from King of the Hill
2016-01-05 15:35:51	na_th_an	when somebody is serving up humble pie, why do you keep going for seconds?
2016-01-05 15:36:00	frappuccino	what
2016-01-05 15:36:04	frappuccino	humble pie
2016-01-05 15:36:27	frappuccino	who is being humble
2016-01-05 15:36:48	na_th_an	oh there's a word for this
2016-01-05 15:36:55	na_th_an	mishearing something a lot
2016-01-05 15:36:57	na_th_an	anyway
2016-01-05 15:37:10	na_th_an	wait no
2016-01-05 15:37:14	na_th_an	humble pie is correct
2016-01-05 15:37:18	na_th_an	it comes from umble pie
2016-01-05 15:37:19	frappuccino	i dont get it
2016-01-05 15:37:24	frappuccino	how does this apply
2016-01-05 15:37:30	na_th_an	The expression derives from umble pie, which was a pie filled with the chopped or minced parts of a beast's 'pluck' - the heart, liver, lungs or 'lights' and kidneys, especially of deer but often other meats. Umble evolved from numble, (after the French nomble) meaning 'deer's innards'.[1][2]
2016-01-05 15:37:41	na_th_an	she's serving up shit you don't want but you keep coming back for more
2016-01-05 15:38:02	frappuccino	i dont get the humble part
2016-01-05 15:38:04	frappuccino	but anyway
2016-01-05 15:38:10	na_th_an	because the pie is shitty
2016-01-05 15:38:13	na_th_an	you don't want that pie
2016-01-05 15:38:16	frappuccino	i dont
2016-01-05 15:38:39	na_th_an	humble like she's humbling you
2016-01-05 15:38:44	na_th_an	she's trying to make you feel like shit
2016-01-05 15:38:48	na_th_an	she's serving you humble pie
2016-01-05 15:39:07	frappuccino	okay
2016-01-05 15:39:09	frappuccino	got it
2016-01-05 15:39:15	frappuccino	great quote btw
2016-01-05 15:39:26	na_th_an	not sure if sarcastic
2016-01-05 15:39:36	frappuccino	yes
2016-01-05 15:39:44	na_th_an	it is a great quote
2016-01-05 15:39:48	na_th_an	you just didn't understand the idiom
2016-01-05 15:39:57	na_th_an	it's 100% relevant here too
2016-01-05 15:40:04	frappuccino	okay anyway
2016-01-05 15:40:07	frappuccino	what do i do
2016-01-05 15:40:15	frappuccino	what are the chances of it getting better
2016-01-05 15:40:17	frappuccino	probably low
2016-01-05 15:40:17	na_th_an	0
2016-01-05 15:40:21	na_th_an	they won't
2016-01-05 15:40:24	na_th_an	are you kidding
2016-01-05 15:40:24	frappuccino	either way, i shouldnt hope
2016-01-05 15:40:32	na_th_an	she responds to "lol" with that
2016-01-05 15:40:39	frappuccino	true
2016-01-05 15:40:44	na_th_an	how much time have you spent with this girl?
2016-01-05 15:40:56	na_th_an	and her immediate reaction to a snap from some other girl you don't even like was what?
2016-01-05 15:40:58	frappuccino	on and off for 3 years
2016-01-05 15:41:07	na_th_an	honestly
2016-01-05 15:41:09	frappuccino	3 and a half years
2016-01-05 15:41:22	na_th_an	you should just block her number, block her on facebook, and try to never have contact with her again
2016-01-05 15:41:48	frappuccino	i mean ihave to say something first
2016-01-05 15:41:54	na_th_an	ehhhh
2016-01-05 15:42:02	na_th_an	you can but you really don't have to
2016-01-05 15:42:13	na_th_an	maybe send a text "we're through, don't contact me"
2016-01-05 15:42:21	frappuccino	like "yo sorry for accidentally kind of getting back together for the 50th time"
2016-01-05 15:42:25	frappuccino	i cant be that cold to her
2016-01-05 15:42:34	na_th_an	"hey sorry you're fucking crazy and I'm not talking to you any more"
2016-01-05 15:42:38	frappuccino	nope
2016-01-05 15:42:43	na_th_an	"in your future relationships try to be less abusive"
2016-01-05 15:42:57	frappuccino	nope
2016-01-05 15:42:59	na_th_an	this girl deserves none of your time
2016-01-05 15:43:01	na_th_an	none of your energy
2016-01-05 15:43:04	na_th_an	none of your emotions
2016-01-05 15:43:07	na_th_an	she deserves nothing from you
2016-01-05 15:43:10	frappuccino	i think you are being a bit harsh
2016-01-05 15:43:22	na_th_an	I think your judgement is being severly clouded
2016-01-05 15:43:31	na_th_an	and if you talked to abby about this situation she'd say the exact same stuff
2016-01-05 15:44:00	na_th_an	if you made a post on /r/relationships about your ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP they'd tell you the same things
2016-01-05 15:45:08	frappuccino	probably
2016-01-05 15:45:29	frappuccino	i also think itd be better for her if we didnt talk 
2016-01-05 15:45:37	na_th_an	in the same way that lindsey is a textbook abuser, you are the textbook abusee
2016-01-05 15:45:45	frappuccino	we've been doing the same thing for like 3 years, its obviously not going anywhere
2016-01-05 15:45:49	frappuccino	what
2016-01-05 15:45:50	na_th_an	no, it isn't
2016-01-05 15:45:53	na_th_an	and it's not going to get better
2016-01-05 15:45:59	frappuccino	what
2016-01-05 15:46:02	frappuccino	i said if we didnt talk
2016-01-05 15:46:12	na_th_an	it's not going anwyhere
2016-01-05 15:46:14	frappuccino	like itd be healthier for her to stop talking to me
2016-01-05 15:46:16	na_th_an	I'm agreeing
2016-01-05 15:46:19	frappuccino	oh
2016-01-05 15:46:20	frappuccino	yeah
2016-01-05 15:46:21	frappuccino	oh okay
2016-01-05 15:46:21	na_th_an	and it would be better for her to not talk to you
2016-01-05 15:46:33	na_th_an	it would be better for both of you
2016-01-05 15:46:37	frappuccino	i dont think she would be this abusive to someone else

2016-01-05 15:49:47	frappuccino	idk about that
2016-01-05 15:49:51	frappuccino	i dont think our past is good
2016-01-05 15:50:05	na_th_an	you're forgetting bad things that happened and it makes your past look better than it was
2016-01-05 15:50:29	frappuccino	should i just be like

2016-01-05 15:52:33	na_th_an	still
2016-01-05 15:52:37	frappuccino	like she knows that I know she has really bad anxiety
2016-01-05 15:52:47	frappuccino	also
2016-01-05 15:52:55	frappuccino	i think she thinks im mad at her
2016-01-05 15:53:00	frappuccino	so she might be trying to make me not mad at her
2016-01-05 15:53:27	frappuccino	i dont want to abruptly be like "we're done"
2016-01-05 15:53:36	na_th_an	yeah so what are you gonna do

2016-01-05 15:54:01	frappuccino	she told me she was coming over
2016-01-05 15:54:08	frappuccino	and i was like "no im about to go to bed"
2016-01-05 15:54:19	frappuccino	and she was like no im coming over and i was like "dont come over"
2016-01-05 15:54:21	frappuccino	and she came over
2016-01-05 15:54:24	frappuccino	and then wouldnt leave
2016-01-05 15:54:32	frappuccino	shit her sweater is in my dresser
2016-01-05 15:54:43	frappuccino	she's gonna ask to get it
2016-01-05 15:54:49	frappuccino	i kind of think she put it there for that reason
2016-01-05 15:54:50	na_th_an	so you give it to a friend
2016-01-05 15:54:55	na_th_an	and have that friend give it to her
2016-01-05 15:55:03	na_th_an	I'll do it
2016-01-05 15:55:14	frappuccino	i could just put it in her mailboxx
2016-01-05 15:55:22	na_th_an	that's a federal offense
2016-01-05 15:55:31	frappuccino	why
2016-01-05 15:55:34	frappuccino	i mean i know but
2016-01-05 15:55:51	na_th_an	mailboxes are like, legally federal property or something dumb like that
2016-01-05 15:56:03	na_th_an	it's illegal to put anything but mail in them
2016-01-05 15:56:08	na_th_an	and illegal for anyone but USPS to put mail in them
2016-01-05 15:56:09	frappuccino	bleh
2016-01-05 15:56:16	frappuccino	this is shitty of me to do
2016-01-05 15:56:22	na_th_an	no it isn't
2016-01-05 15:56:22	frappuccino	because i always know it wont work
2016-01-05 15:56:27	frappuccino	but i got back in it somehow
2016-01-05 15:56:29	frappuccino	she initiated it thoug
2016-01-05 15:56:30	na_th_an	it's shitty of her to do this shit to you
2016-01-05 15:56:48	na_th_an	you don't need this in your life
2016-01-05 15:58:18	frappuccino	im trying to list things she does
2016-01-05 15:59:26	na_th_an	google for some sign of abusive relationships
2016-01-05 16:01:44	frappuccino	"blame you for their own abusive behavior" is on there
2016-01-05 16:16:34	frappuccino	welp
2016-01-05 16:16:38	frappuccino	this is what i have so far
2016-01-05 16:16:39	frappuccino	http://pastebin.com/7BXNT7Eq
2016-01-05 16:17:18	frappuccino	excessively jealous*
2016-01-05 16:18:11	na_th_an	seems pretty good
2016-01-05 16:18:18	frappuccino	should i add more
2016-01-05 16:18:36	na_th_an	"This isn't up for discussion. I'm blocking your number."
2016-01-05 16:18:44	frappuccino	true
2016-01-05 16:21:52	na_th_an	yo so you know how I broke up with Haley right
2016-01-05 16:22:01	frappuccino	yeah
2016-01-05 16:22:15	na_th_an	well obv people keep asking me why and I always give them some half truth answers
2016-01-05 16:22:30	na_th_an	but the more I think about it the more I think the real reason that I ended it with her
2016-01-05 16:22:50	na_th_an	is because she cut her hair and I was totally unattracted to her for like 2 years because of it
2016-01-05 16:23:10	na_th_an	I told I didn't really like short hair and I wasn't sure how I'd feel if she got it, but it's her hair etc
2016-01-05 16:23:16	na_th_an	and she got it cut really really short eventually
2016-01-05 16:23:53	na_th_an	and I think I resented her more and more over time because I really liked her and wanted the relationship to work but was totally unattracted to her physically
2016-01-05 16:24:22	na_th_an	and I think that resentment grew over time to the point where I just didn't ever want to be with her
2016-01-05 16:24:59	na_th_an	I tried to get her to do some things that would maybe make me feel more attracted to her but she never ever did
2016-01-05 16:25:15	na_th_an	she graduated college wearing the same clothes that she wore when we started dating
2016-01-05 16:25:35	na_th_an	she doesn't own one single cute piece of underwear
2016-01-05 16:25:39	frappuccino	http://pastebin.com/05tu6UYh
2016-01-05 16:25:40	frappuccino	udpated
2016-01-05 16:25:58	na_th_an	and the more I think about it the more I think that's what eventually caused me to break up with her
2016-01-05 16:26:25	frappuccino	attraction is very important
2016-01-05 16:26:41	na_th_an	that seems good though
2016-01-05 16:26:44	frappuccino	and a major change to your appearance like that will most likely alter your SOs attraction to you
2016-01-05 16:27:14	frappuccino	I didn't want to seem accusing
2016-01-05 16:27:23	frappuccino	like I understand I have most likely hurt her multiple time
2016-01-05 16:27:24	frappuccino	s
2016-01-05 16:27:28	frappuccino	and she might think i am abusive
2016-01-05 16:27:34	frappuccino	and that only helps my case
2016-01-05 16:27:47	na_th_an	I think you were more apologetic than you have to be
2016-01-05 16:27:54	na_th_an	you're good
2016-01-05 16:28:45	frappuccino	sent
2016-01-05 16:28:59	na_th_an	\o/

2016-01-05 16:30:30	na_th_an	I've felt at least some of that feel every day for months
2016-01-05 16:30:40	frappuccino	at least I typed it out and it was explained and not just "bye"
2016-01-05 16:31:19	na_th_an	now block her number
2016-01-05 16:31:21	frappuccino	my mom said to me a couple weeks ago "im worried about you and that lindsey girl, just from some things you told me. I don't want her to bring you down"
2016-01-05 16:31:23	frappuccino	that got me

2016-01-05 17:00:22	na_th_an	I doubt she would

2016-01-06 10:27:55	na_th_an	me too
2016-01-06 10:27:59	na_th_an	you did the right thing tho
2016-01-06 10:28:11	na_th_an	I wonder if anyone dislikes the sound of my keyboard
2016-01-06 10:28:18	frappuccino	i wonder that somtimes
2016-01-06 10:28:23	frappuccino	if people next to me can hear it
2016-01-06 10:28:32	na_th_an	mine isn't very loud
2016-01-06 10:28:36	frappuccino	i should put a sign
2016-01-06 10:28:41	na_th_an	I'm trying to get better at not bottoming out too
2016-01-06 10:28:53	na_th_an	they're not clicky, it could be worse
2016-01-06 10:28:55	na_th_an	we're not mike
2016-01-06 10:28:56	frappuccino	i am too but then again its just so nice
2016-01-06 10:29:08	frappuccino	its so satisfying
2016-01-06 10:29:12	na_th_an	I don't think it's unreasonable to use mx browns
2016-01-06 10:29:15	na_th_an	at all
2016-01-06 10:29:20	na_th_an	and I'm very noise concious
2016-01-06 10:29:29	frappuccino	i try to not bottom out
2016-01-06 10:29:34	frappuccino	i dont think i did during that sentence
2016-01-06 10:29:36	frappuccino	or that one
2016-01-06 10:29:38	na_th_an	it's pretty hard
2016-01-06 10:29:42	na_th_an	when you're not thinking about it
2016-01-06 10:29:47	frappuccino	yeah
2016-01-06 10:29:49	na_th_an	I at least try not to bottom out super hard
2016-01-06 10:30:01	frappuccino	yeah if im just typing i totally bottom out
2016-01-06 10:30:06	frappuccino	i might get o rings
2016-01-06 10:30:16	na_th_an	I wanna try them
2016-01-06 10:30:17	na_th_an	I'm interested
2016-01-06 10:30:32	na_th_an	I also wanna build my own keyboard
2016-01-06 10:30:33	frappuccino	it just keeps you from bottoming out right
2016-01-06 10:31:00	na_th_an	o-rings?
2016-01-06 10:31:06	frappuccino	yeah
2016-01-06 10:31:10	na_th_an	they're supposed to dampen bottoming out so it doesn't make as much noise
2016-01-06 10:31:22	na_th_an	you can find comparison videos for cherry mx browns on youtube I'm sure
2016-01-06 10:32:59	frappuccino	i just watched one
2016-01-06 10:33:04	frappuccino	i dont think mine is that loud
2016-01-06 10:33:14	frappuccino	now that im just typing without headphones, it kind of is
2016-01-06 10:33:18	frappuccino	idk about outside of my cube though
2016-01-06 10:33:23	frappuccino	you should walk by lol
2016-01-06 10:33:55	na_th_an	I def type louder with headphones on
2016-01-06 10:34:02	frappuccino	true

2016-01-06 10:45:25	frappuccino	did you see obama's executive order for gun safety or whatevz
2016-01-06 10:53:13	na_th_an	I heard a little bit about it
2016-01-06 10:53:17	na_th_an	background checks
2016-01-06 10:53:28	na_th_an	I don't really have a problem with it tbh but I don't know that much
2016-01-06 10:53:45	na_th_an	I'm relatively pro gun ownership but I really hate how some people approach gun control
2016-01-06 11:06:39	frappuccino	oh snap

2016-01-06 11:08:46	frappuccino	operations or whatever
2016-01-06 11:08:48	na_th_an	devops
2016-01-06 11:08:52	na_th_an	middleware
2016-01-06 11:08:54	frappuccino	yeah
2016-01-06 11:08:56	frappuccino	so
2016-01-06 11:09:14	frappuccino	they are starting to try to analyze how effecient scrum teams are or sometthing
2016-01-06 11:09:22	na_th_an	yeah
2016-01-06 11:09:26	na_th_an	I saw the thing he's doing
2016-01-06 11:09:27	frappuccino	and my team is one of the first ones or something
2016-01-06 11:09:34	na_th_an	yeah
2016-01-06 11:09:34	frappuccino	is he also doing it on your team
2016-01-06 11:09:37	frappuccino	did you get the email
2016-01-06 11:09:46	na_th_an	no I didn't
2016-01-06 11:09:48	frappuccino	oh
2016-01-06 11:09:57	frappuccino	well yeah so they're doing it with my team
2016-01-06 11:10:06	frappuccino	and they are asking things like "how often do your devs commit code" and stuff
2016-01-06 11:10:18	frappuccino	and people are on my team are not supportive lol
2016-01-06 11:10:31	frappuccino	the whole team is bitching in an email
2016-01-06 11:10:32	na_th_an	how surprising
2016-01-06 11:10:38	na_th_an	I kinda wanna see
2016-01-06 11:10:40	na_th_an	can you forward it to me
2016-01-06 11:10:59	frappuccino	"Also because the result will apparently be some sort of score of our team.  They will take that view that one size fits all.  We may all be evaluated against Discovery’s practices, which isn’t completely fair since they have an entire team just to worry about ‘innovation’."
2016-01-06 11:11:01	frappuccino	said my manager
2016-01-06 11:11:14	na_th_an	that's literally exactly what patrick said they aren't doing
2016-01-06 11:11:19	frappuccino	whaht
2016-01-06 11:11:28	na_th_an	the score isn't about comparing teams to other teams
2016-01-06 11:11:31	na_th_an	but measing improvement
2016-01-06 11:11:33	na_th_an	measuring*
2016-01-06 11:11:46	na_th_an	that way patrick can say "see, they're more agile now than they were a month ago"
2016-01-06 11:11:52	frappuccino	he apparently didnt make that clear
2016-01-06 11:12:07	na_th_an	he's very open to working with teams in areas they want to improve rather than telling them what they should do
2016-01-06 11:12:14	frappuccino	"We don’t unit test.  We don’t code review.  We don’t do a lot of things that are commonplace around OCLC.  We’re gonna get ripped apart.    Shrug."
2016-01-06 11:12:18	frappuccino	said a dev
2016-01-06 11:12:27	na_th_an	SHRUG IS YOUR ATTITUDE TO THAT
2016-01-06 11:12:29	na_th_an	what a shitty dev
2016-01-06 11:12:37	na_th_an	I bet s/he writes great code
2016-01-06 11:12:39	frappuccino	he's not a shitty dev
2016-01-06 11:12:45	frappuccino	he does write good code lol
2016-01-06 11:12:48	na_th_an	that's a shitty attitude
2016-01-06 11:12:49	frappuccino	our team is weird
2016-01-06 11:12:57	frappuccino	how
2016-01-06 11:13:17	na_th_an	but anyway, he literally said when he was explaining this to us that if a team scores a 2 right now and they get to an 8 or something shitty than that's fine
2016-01-06 11:13:20	na_th_an	it's improvement
2016-01-06 11:13:35	na_th_an	there are some things that improve code quality. Shrugging off those things is a shitty attitude.
2016-01-06 11:13:49	frappuccino	he's not shrugging off those things
2016-01-06 11:14:00	frappuccino	he's shrugging the fact that we're gonna get a shitty score
2016-01-06 11:14:19	frappuccino	we have a bunch of random products that have been thrown upon us because of the nature of what our team is
2016-01-06 11:14:23	na_th_an	yeah
2016-01-06 11:14:27	frappuccino	we have 3 full time devs and me
2016-01-06 11:14:41	frappuccino	and a bunch of products
2016-01-06 11:14:58	frappuccino	one of the devs isnt even working on our team right now because he got pulled away
2016-01-06 11:14:59	na_th_an	from the email it sounds like he's the kind of dev that doesn't give a shit about code reviews and static analysis tools
2016-01-06 11:15:14	frappuccino	thats not correct
2016-01-06 11:15:27	na_th_an	it's like when we could have had a consistent style across AE stuff but there was no actual adoption of any checkstyle rules
2016-01-06 11:15:35	na_th_an	but patrick was like "whatever idc"
2016-01-06 11:21:23	frappuccino	meh
2016-01-06 11:25:43	frappuccino	omg yesterday
2016-01-06 11:25:54	frappuccino	this guy on my team was telling me to do something
2016-01-06 11:26:09	frappuccino	in which i had to ssh to something and change a file in a tomcat webapp
2016-01-06 11:26:23	frappuccino	except i didnt know what he was telling me to do
2016-01-06 11:26:49	frappuccino	so he was like do you have access to this machine? and i was like "i dont think so"
2016-01-06 11:27:11	frappuccino	but then he just told me a username and password they all use any way so yes i had access to the machine
2016-01-06 11:27:12	frappuccino	so
2016-01-06 11:27:43	frappuccino	instead of telling my to ssh he was like "go to terminal"
2016-01-06 11:27:53	frappuccino	except he has an indian accent so i couldn't understand him
2016-01-06 11:28:01	frappuccino	so I was like "what?"
2016-01-06 11:28:16	frappuccino	then he was like "go to terminal, its an application"
2016-01-06 11:28:25	frappuccino	and i was like "oh terminal, okay"
2016-01-06 11:28:50	frappuccino	then he was like "connect to the machine" and i was like using what
2016-01-06 11:28:57	frappuccino	and he was like "type s"
2016-01-06 11:29:00	frappuccino	"s-h"
2016-01-06 11:29:05	frappuccino	and i was like oh ssh okay
2016-01-06 11:29:27	frappuccino	so i typed ssh holland@whatever.whatever
2016-01-06 11:29:34	frappuccino	and he was like no the user is blah
2016-01-06 11:29:42	frappuccino	so i was like okay and fixed
2016-01-06 11:29:54	frappuccino	and then it took a minute to get the password because i couldnt understand him
2016-01-06 11:30:07	frappuccino	so anyway im connected now
2016-01-06 11:30:31	frappuccino	and then he tells me to go to the tomcat directory and im like how the hell would i know where that is
2016-01-06 11:30:38	frappuccino	so then he gets me there
2016-01-06 11:30:44	frappuccino	then he's like "open that file"
2016-01-06 11:30:51	frappuccino	and i was like "what?"
2016-01-06 11:30:57	frappuccino	like open it with what
2016-01-06 11:31:02	frappuccino	and then he was like "type v"
2016-01-06 11:31:04	frappuccino	"i"
2016-01-06 11:31:18	frappuccino	and im like oh okay now i get what you are asking
2016-01-06 11:31:28	frappuccino	and then i edit and save and shit and it was just frustrating
2016-01-06 11:31:32	frappuccino	i think he thought i was clueless
2016-01-06 11:32:03	frappuccino	he could have just been like "ssh to this host with user and pass, go to this dir, change this file"
2016-01-06 11:38:09	na_th_an	omg wall of text
2016-01-06 11:38:12	na_th_an	this is gonna tae a minute
2016-01-06 11:39:23	na_th_an	lol
2016-01-06 11:39:31	na_th_an	that's like the opposite of trying to get faisal to do things
2016-01-06 11:39:38	na_th_an	I would be helping him and be like "ssh into this machine"
2016-01-06 11:39:43	na_th_an	and it'd be the opposite
2016-01-06 11:39:51	na_th_an	where I'd have to be like "do you have any ssh installed"
2016-01-06 11:39:55	frappuccino	what kind of phone does claudia have
2016-01-06 11:39:56	na_th_an	and then we'd go download putty
2016-01-06 11:39:59	na_th_an	i have no idea
2016-01-06 11:40:08	na_th_an	she's a white college girl so I'd bet an iphone

2016-01-06 11:40:22	frappuccino	i texted her "when are you coming back"
2016-01-06 11:40:25	frappuccino	and she said "never"
2016-01-06 11:40:29	na_th_an	:'(
2016-01-06 11:40:31	frappuccino	and i said ":O"

When I go to the Ask Skip page I would like to be greeted by a photo of at least twice the size, with twice the staring depth. I would really like you to stare much deeper into my soul. Please let me know."

2016-02-03 11:36:52	frappuccino	that's how I judge whether or not something is good
2016-02-03 11:36:57	frappuccino	if someone else looked at it would they be impressed
2016-02-03 15:36:44	frappuccino	lol "these niggas actin like they signin the declaration of independence"
2016-02-03 15:36:48	frappuccino	a comment on the tidal video
2016-02-03 15:37:36	frappuccino	"this is a historical day" lol
2016-02-03 15:37:49	frappuccino	"this movement feels so eagel-ous" lol
2016-02-03 15:39:33	frappuccino	lol keep your emotions in your music because you guys do not understand business or marketing or anything besides art apparently lol
2016-02-03 15:39:42	frappuccino	i forgot how funny this is
2016-02-03 15:40:32	na_th_an	can I cite tidal as the reason I don't like jay-z
2016-02-03 15:40:34	na_th_an	is that ok
2016-02-03 15:40:43	frappuccino	yes lol
2016-02-03 15:41:15	frappuccino	like did they actually think they were changing the world or did they all know they were all full of shit
2016-02-03 15:42:24	frappuccino	artist getting paid more is cool (does that actually happen?) but being humble about a good idea is probably a good idea lol
2016-02-03 15:42:53	frappuccino	imagine if when github came out they made some obnoxious video about changing the world lol
2016-02-03 15:44:03	na_th_an	pretty sure tidal is shit for artists
2016-02-03 15:44:13	frappuccino	wtf lol
2016-02-03 15:44:13	na_th_an	possibly because nobody uses it
2016-02-03 15:44:28	na_th_an	it at least isn't amazing
2016-02-03 15:44:30	frappuccino	and streaming was kind of saturated when they arrived
2016-02-03 15:44:31	na_th_an	or really great
2016-02-03 15:44:41	na_th_an	yeah they had a decent idea with the hi-fi audio
2016-02-03 15:44:45	na_th_an	but $20/mo is WAY too much
2016-02-03 15:44:53	frappuccino	$240 a year lolol
2016-02-03 15:44:55	na_th_an	I'm their perfect target audience
2016-02-03 15:45:02	na_th_an	and I have NO interest in their service
2016-02-03 15:45:08	frappuccino	I'm sure they're music options aren't great too
2016-02-03 15:45:11	na_th_an	yeah
2016-02-03 15:45:19	na_th_an	there are some exclusives but not a lot of stuff
2016-02-03 15:45:20	frappuccino	google play is great
2016-02-03 15:45:24	frappuccino	apple music is great
2016-02-03 15:45:48	frappuccino	apple music does this cool thing where they put up an album of an artist before it released but the tracks that haven't been released yet or grayed out
2016-02-03 15:46:01	frappuccino	are grayed out*
2016-02-03 15:46:06	frappuccino	I thought it was cool
2016-02-05 11:19:48	frappuccino	lindsey texted me from like 4 different numbers last night

2016-02-05 11:27:48	na_th_an	or like, if something happens have some kind of record that she's crazy and harrassing you
2016-02-05 11:27:53	na_th_an	so that you don't get blamed for something she does
2016-02-05 11:28:37	na_th_an	you don't want her to like, show up and claim you hit her or something
2016-02-05 11:29:17	frappuccino	i am never going to meet up with her in person
2016-02-05 11:29:43	na_th_an	you won't purposely
2016-02-05 11:29:48	frappuccino	im dropping off her stupid mario kart on her door step and noping away forever
2016-02-05 11:29:49	na_th_an	but she knows where you live and go to school and stuff
2016-02-05 11:29:54	frappuccino	yeah she did show up at my house

2016-02-05 14:58:39	na_th_an	he's wearing some costume walking around yelling "ASK ME ABOUT MY TESLA"

2016-02-05 15:00:35	frappuccino	http://thebreakthrough.org/images/main_image/south_park_smug_prius.png
2016-02-05 15:00:39	na_th_an	he's like "is everything alright?"
2016-02-05 15:00:50	na_th_an	I'm like "ya I just gotta add fluids to it pretty often. It's old you know"
2016-02-05 15:01:02	na_th_an	he said "oh ok. Yeah, I don't have to do any of that stuff any more."
2016-02-05 15:01:18	na_th_an	and he stopped talking and I waited until it was slightly awkward and said
2016-02-05 15:01:27	na_th_an	"oh yeah?"
2016-02-05 15:01:36	na_th_an	he's like "yeah I don't have to do oil or gas or anything"
2016-02-05 15:01:43	na_th_an	I said "How do you get away with the no gas thing?"
2016-02-05 15:01:47	na_th_an	and he's like "TESLA"

2016-02-26 13:46:44	frappuccino	lol
2016-02-26 13:46:48	na_th_an	that's what matters
2016-02-26 13:47:00	frappuccino	yeah when mike pointed things out i was like "oh yep woops"
2016-02-26 14:10:16	frappuccino	is your hourly like $28.85?
2016-02-26 14:10:48	frappuccino	how did your part time work?
2016-02-26 14:10:52	frappuccino	you were paid for 20 hours right
2016-02-26 14:12:52	na_th_an	I did 12 hours a week
2016-02-26 14:13:15	frappuccino	so you got $28.85 for those 12 a week?
2016-02-26 14:13:21	na_th_an	idk
2016-02-26 14:13:28	frappuccino	do you remember what you pay checks were?
2016-02-26 14:13:30	frappuccino	every 2 weeks?
2016-02-26 14:13:37	frappuccino	were they like $800
2016-02-26 14:14:38	na_th_an	uhhh I can't really remember
2016-02-26 14:14:45	frappuccino	aw
2016-02-26 14:14:47	frappuccino	i wanna know lol
2016-02-26 14:15:01	na_th_an	I also like, never really got a normal paycheck
2016-02-26 14:15:09	na_th_an	with like, a full month of normal working
2016-02-26 14:15:09	frappuccino	what do you mean
2016-02-26 14:15:12	na_th_an	or maybe I did
2016-02-26 14:15:15	frappuccino	oh
2016-02-26 14:15:16	frappuccino	idk
2016-02-26 14:15:17	frappuccino	oh well
2016-02-26 14:15:24	frappuccino	i just wanted to know what to expect
2016-02-26 14:15:25	na_th_an	I think I might have gotten like $900 for the 12 hours?
2016-02-26 14:15:38	frappuccino	you said your salary is 60 right?
2016-02-26 14:15:40	frappuccino	60 flat?

2016-02-26 14:15:47	frappuccino	cool
2016-02-26 14:16:00	frappuccino	that puts you at 28.85 an hour i think
2016-02-26 14:16:13	na_th_an	30 days in a month - 8 days for weekends = 22 work days
2016-02-26 14:16:26	na_th_an	22 work days * 8 hours = 176 hours a month
2016-02-26 14:16:47	na_th_an	I get paid about 3450 after taxes
2016-02-26 14:16:51	na_th_an	and that's about $20/hr

2016-02-26 14:17:04	frappuccino	28.4 before taxes
2016-02-26 14:17:08	na_th_an	so your hourly would be slightly higher

2016-03-02 09:57:02	frappuccino	and then i told him about my trade-in and that i'll probably take it to carmax, and he was like "yeah carmax will probably give you more, so if you bring the carmax appraisal we'll match you. i'll give you a couple thousand off to get you out here"
2016-03-02 09:57:35	frappuccino	he really wants to steal columbus business lol

2016-03-02 09:58:28	frappuccino	if i can get them to
2016-03-02 10:00:41	na_th_an	I can't believe you're going to get a new car
2016-03-02 10:00:58	frappuccino	i'm still gonna look at some used
2016-03-02 10:01:47	na_th_an	I feel like I could have gotten a less expensive car than I did
2016-03-02 10:01:54	na_th_an	I really dig the car I got tho
2016-03-02 10:01:59	na_th_an	the bluetooth is nice

2016-03-02 10:04:27	na_th_an	it's really nice
2016-03-02 10:04:56	na_th_an	a lot of people recommend getting a ground loop isolator. I went ahead and got one just in case. My car doesn't seem to need it but I'm using it anyway
2016-03-02 10:05:09	frappuccino	so like i didn't copy the last 13 characters of the url but it still worked
2016-03-02 10:05:21	na_th_an	yeah that's stuff about my search refinements

2016-03-02 10:06:00	frappuccino	hey i see from the pictures that a push to start comes with it
2016-03-02 10:06:00	na_th_an	and also I have it set as a trusted device so my phone unlocks
2016-03-02 10:06:20	frappuccino	yep i like that feature

2016-03-02 14:01:17	na_th_an	if they weren't gonna hire you, you'd hear back pretty quick though
2016-03-02 14:01:23	na_th_an	she probably isn't
2016-03-02 14:01:27	frappuccino	true
2016-03-02 14:01:39	frappuccino	even if disco doesn't hire me there's a spot on SS

2016-03-02 14:01:52	na_th_an	and be like
2016-03-02 14:01:52	frappuccino	:P
2016-03-02 14:01:54	na_th_an	"I'm so disco"
2016-03-02 14:01:57	na_th_an	in your cube
2016-03-02 14:01:59	frappuccino	then they'll be like
2016-03-02 14:02:01	frappuccino	heres your job
2016-03-02 14:02:08	frappuccino	na_th_an: lets buy one for disco
2016-03-02 14:02:20	na_th_an	I'm down
2016-03-02 14:02:29	frappuccino	lets spread the beanie baby love through discovery lol
2016-03-02 14:02:38	frappuccino	everyone must have a beanie baby on their monitor
2016-03-02 14:36:20	frappuccino	found the exact one I want with the lighting package and everything in lousivlle for $21851
2016-03-02 14:40:03	na_th_an	add like another $3k on that with taxes and fees and shit probably
2016-03-02 14:40:11	na_th_an	there might be an additional tax for buying out of state
2016-03-02 14:40:49	frappuccino	after dealer discounts and talking down and college grad discount I'd be about the same
2016-03-02 14:40:51	frappuccino	probably less
2016-03-02 14:41:06	frappuccino	tax would be the only significant thing
2016-03-02 16:54:45	frappuccino	my method doc is legit amirite http://pastebin.com/cKkXeukH
2016-03-02 17:00:47	na_th_an	why did you send that to me
2016-03-02 17:00:53	na_th_an	and why in pm
2016-03-02 17:00:57	frappuccino	lol
2016-03-02 17:01:04	frappuccino	im just sharing my doc with you
2016-03-02 17:01:09	frappuccino	i haven't docd in a long time
2016-03-02 17:01:10	na_th_an	also
2016-03-02 17:01:20	frappuccino	waht\
2016-03-02 17:01:20	na_th_an	if you have a rest controller that always returns the same code
2016-03-02 17:01:35	frappuccino	same code? like status code?
2016-03-02 17:01:56	na_th_an	you can use @ResponseStatus to set the status code
2016-03-02 17:02:05	frappuccino	cool
2016-03-02 17:02:58	na_th_an	and on those methods you can just return a Map<String, Object> like you have there
2016-03-02 17:03:13	na_th_an	you should probably change the method signature to return the interface (Map) instead of the implementation (HashMap)
2016-03-02 17:03:26	frappuccino	why
2016-03-02 17:03:34	na_th_an	on methods where you want to manually set the status code you should return a ResponseEntity<Map<String,Object>>
2016-03-02 17:04:26	frappuccino	why ResponseEntity
2016-03-02 17:04:27	frappuccino	what is that
2016-03-02 17:04:54	na_th_an	because your implementation of your controller doesn't depend on the implementation of map that you want to use
2016-03-02 17:04:59	na_th_an	also
2016-03-02 17:05:01	frappuccino	instead of passing the HttpServletResponse?
2016-03-02 17:05:08	na_th_an	responseentity basically holds a status code and payload
2016-03-02 17:05:13	na_th_an	I showed you an example of that before
2016-03-02 17:05:23	frappuccino	I'll change that tomorrow
2016-03-02 17:05:24	frappuccino	im leavin

2016-04-06 15:13:07	na_th_an	they make you do exit counciling and part of it is some loan payment analysis
2016-04-06 15:13:17	na_th_an	like if you make X payments you are done in Y years and pay Z in interest
2016-04-06 15:13:17	frappuccino	who is they
2016-04-06 15:13:31	na_th_an	if you took public federal loans you're going to have to do it
2016-04-06 15:13:36	na_th_an	stafford exit counseling
2016-04-06 15:13:39	frappuccino	i don't think i did

2016-04-06 15:14:05	na_th_an	that's the federal loan wahtever
2016-04-06 15:14:07	na_th_an	it's just an internet thing
2016-04-06 15:14:10	frappuccino	oh
2016-04-06 15:14:12	frappuccino	phew

2016-04-06 15:23:28	frappuccino	or whatever that would be called
2016-04-06 15:24:26	na_th_an	ovh
2016-04-06 15:24:47	na_th_an	it's v nice
2016-04-06 15:24:57	na_th_an	my VPN connection has been stable
2016-04-06 15:25:04	frappuccino	do companies actually pay companies to host dedicated servers
2016-04-06 15:25:54	frappuccino	dedicated cloud is $573 a month
2016-04-06 15:25:55	frappuccino	lol
2016-04-06 15:26:19	na_th_an	for most companies it makes a lot more sense to use a hosting provider rather than run your own datacenter
2016-04-06 15:26:23	na_th_an	economy of scale and whatnot
2016-04-06 15:26:30	na_th_an	not to mention things like scalability, DDOS prevention, etc
2016-04-06 15:26:40	frappuccino	wtf is a vps cloud
2016-04-06 15:26:56	na_th_an	dedicated server -> running on hardware
2016-04-06 15:27:11	na_th_an	virtual server -> running in a VM/container on hardware with many other virtual servers
2016-04-06 15:27:21	na_th_an	so a VPS cloud is a cloud with VPS backends
2016-04-06 15:27:23	na_th_an	rather than dedicated
2016-04-06 15:27:51	frappuccino	and a dedicated cloud is a cloud with dedicated server backends
2016-04-06 15:27:58	frappuccino	so a VPS cloud has a bunch of VPS's
2016-04-06 15:28:10	frappuccino	OpenStack KVM
2016-04-06 15:28:10	frappuccino	1 vCore
2016-04-06 15:28:10	frappuccino	2.4 GHz
2016-04-06 15:28:10	frappuccino	2 GB RAM
2016-04-06 15:28:10	frappuccino	10 GB SSD
2016-04-06 15:28:10	frappuccino	Local RAID 10
2016-04-06 15:28:13	frappuccino	is that what you have
2016-04-06 15:28:26	na_th_an	sounds right
2016-04-06 15:28:29	na_th_an	it's like $3/mo
2016-04-06 15:28:34	frappuccino	budgetvms uptime is so good tho
2016-04-06 15:28:47	na_th_an	ovh is better
2016-04-06 15:29:01	na_th_an	my budgetvm rebooted at least 3 times without me knowing
2016-04-06 15:29:08	frappuccino	at budgetvm i ahve 1gb ram, 100gb hardrive
2016-04-06 15:29:11	frappuccino	dont think its an ssd
2016-04-06 15:29:17	na_th_an	it isn't
2016-04-06 15:29:28	frappuccino	100 Mbps
2016-04-06 15:29:30	frappuccino	whats ovh
2016-04-06 15:29:40	frappuccino	same
2016-04-06 15:30:32	na_th_an	I paid for 3 months at once bc they don't have automatic payments :(
2016-04-06 15:30:36	frappuccino	you runnin arch
2016-04-06 15:30:50	na_th_an	yaya
2016-04-06 15:30:54	frappuccino	do you have snapshot backup
2016-04-06 15:30:57	na_th_an	no
2016-04-06 15:31:01	frappuccino	i kinda wan that
2016-04-06 15:31:05	frappuccino	in case i just fuck it up
2016-04-06 15:31:05	na_th_an	do it yourself
2016-04-06 15:31:09	na_th_an	or not
2016-04-06 15:31:10	frappuccino	where
2016-04-06 15:31:11	frappuccino	yeah
2016-04-06 15:31:13	frappuccino	u rite
2016-04-06 15:31:13	frappuccino	idk
2016-04-06 15:31:20	na_th_an	I mean it'd be easier to use theirs
2016-04-06 15:31:36	na_th_an	but it wouldn't be hard to set up a cron job to do a remote backup once you have your apartment
2016-04-06 15:31:45	na_th_an	just use rsync to do a difference sync
2016-04-06 15:31:47	na_th_an	over ssh
2016-04-06 15:32:05	frappuccino	its suprising that its not cheaper to do longer lease
2016-04-06 15:32:22	na_th_an	with ovh?
2016-04-06 15:32:25	frappuccino	yeah
2016-04-06 15:32:27	na_th_an	I think it is
2016-04-06 15:32:30	frappuccino	its not
2016-04-06 15:32:45	na_th_an	are you sure? I swear I got a discount when I renewed
2016-04-06 15:32:53	frappuccino	yeah
2016-04-06 15:33:16	frappuccino	its all just month_price * lease_length
2016-04-06 15:33:22	frappuccino	for 1 3 6 12
2016-04-06 15:33:29	na_th_an	oh yeah I guess so
2016-04-06 15:33:39	frappuccino	i might do 3 months
2016-04-06 15:33:44	na_th_an	I'd recommend it
2016-04-06 15:33:48	na_th_an	it's only $10.47
2016-04-06 15:33:57	frappuccino	yeah
2016-04-06 15:34:03	frappuccino	i'll do it in the next week
2016-04-06 15:34:07	na_th_an	what distro
2016-04-06 15:34:12	frappuccino	debian probs idk
2016-04-06 15:34:24	frappuccino	i dont have much experience with anything else
2016-04-06 15:34:26	na_th_an	try arch bae
2016-04-06 15:34:29	na_th_an	arch really isn't hard
2016-04-06 15:34:35	na_th_an	and they do like 99% of the work
2016-04-06 15:34:40	na_th_an	and then you have access to the arch wiki
2016-04-06 15:34:42	frappuccino	hmm
2016-04-06 15:34:55	na_th_an	if you don't like it blow it away and install debian
2016-04-06 15:35:06	na_th_an	I've had 0 issues with Arch on OVH
2016-04-06 15:35:23	na_th_an	I'm pretty sure I just had to log in through the control panel and set up a user
2016-04-06 15:35:28	frappuccino	arch is just arch?
2016-04-06 15:35:30	frappuccino	no version?
2016-04-06 15:35:35	na_th_an	arch is rolling release
2016-04-06 15:35:44	frappuccino	coool
2016-04-06 15:35:53	frappuccino	debain 7 sucks
2016-04-06 15:35:59	frappuccino	everything i try to install on here goes wrong
2016-04-06 15:36:01	frappuccino	because debian 7
2016-04-06 15:36:05	na_th_an	I've never been a fan of debian
2016-04-06 15:36:08	na_th_an	it's /okay/
2016-04-06 15:36:18	na_th_an	it's good if you want a stable server with out of date software
2016-04-06 15:36:18	frappuccino	yeah i'll get 3 months on arch in the next week
2016-04-06 15:36:25	frappuccino	i'll launch pernt on it lol
2016-04-06 15:36:49	frappuccino	spring boot/spring mvc/kotlin/postgres
2016-04-06 15:36:49	na_th_an	pernt?
2016-04-06 15:36:58	frappuccino	the js drawing app im making
2016-04-06 15:37:01	na_th_an	oh
2016-04-06 15:37:05	frappuccino	there's gonna be a backend for sharing drawing
2016-04-06 15:37:05	frappuccino	s
2016-04-06 15:37:25	frappuccino	GUID after url kinda thing
2016-04-06 15:37:52	na_th_an	UUID
2016-04-06 15:38:02	frappuccino	same thing
2016-04-06 15:38:03	na_th_an	I was curious bc I didn't know so I just googled it
2016-04-06 15:38:09	na_th_an	GUID is the Microsoft implementation of GUID
2016-04-06 15:38:14	frappuccino	GUID is just global
2016-04-06 15:38:14	na_th_an	err of UUID
2016-04-06 15:38:25	na_th_an	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/246930/is-there-any-difference-between-a-guid-and-a-uuid
2016-04-06 15:38:26	frappuccino	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_unique_identifier
2016-04-06 15:38:29	na_th_an	"GUID is Microsoft's implementation of the UUID standard.
2016-04-06 15:38:50	frappuccino	oh i thought they were synonmous
2016-04-06 15:39:02	na_th_an	Just like microsoft to take something that works everywhere (the universe) and make it work in a very small subset (the globe) :)
2016-04-06 15:39:04	na_th_an	lol

2016-04-15 10:37:19	na_th_an	well she almost just went home when it came up but she was too drunk to drive
2016-04-15 10:37:28	na_th_an	she did end up still sleeping in my bed
2016-04-15 10:37:30	na_th_an	nobody slept on the couch
2016-04-15 10:37:34	na_th_an	but she's pretty hurt and mad at me
2016-04-15 10:37:41	frappuccino	i mean, that happened a long time ago
2016-04-15 10:38:04	frappuccino	i've been through a lot of shitty relationship bullshit and that is not really something that she can be mad/upset about...
2016-04-15 10:38:17	na_th_an	idk I don't think she's in the wrong
2016-04-15 10:38:26	frappuccino	upset i guess, but it happened 1) like 5 months ago and 2) when you guys weren't dating
2016-04-15 10:38:29	na_th_an	it was a week after we broke up and I was in our bed and I kissed some girl
2016-04-15 10:38:47	frappuccino	so what, it could've been a lot worse
2016-04-15 10:38:54	frappuccino	and still, it's not like you cheated on her
2016-04-15 10:39:00	na_th_an	no I didn't
2016-04-15 10:39:03	frappuccino	and it doesn't really matter considering that happened like 5 months ago
2016-04-15 10:39:03	na_th_an	I think it'll be okay
2016-04-15 10:39:13	na_th_an	it matters if it matters to her

2016-04-15 10:39:45	na_th_an	"your feelings are invalid" and "well I guess I'm done if this bothers you" are both not options
2016-04-15 10:40:14	frappuccino	i didn't say those were options lol
2016-04-15 10:40:36	na_th_an	but yeah she's pretty upset and I'm pretty worried about it all

2016-04-15 14:19:02	frappuccino	it says "use command line client: svn"
2016-04-15 14:19:10	frappuccino	and if i do svn --version, it says 1.9
2016-04-15 14:21:38	frappuccino	idk i did it in the command line
2016-04-15 14:21:41	frappuccino	we'll see if it works

2016-04-20 14:20:05	frappuccino	i don't like how its not just install remove or whatever
2016-04-20 14:20:08	na_th_an	it's pretty easy
2016-04-20 14:20:08	frappuccino	-S bleh
2016-04-20 14:20:10	na_th_an	pacman -S
2016-04-20 14:20:14	na_th_an	pacman -R
2016-04-20 14:20:16	na_th_an	pacman -Syu
2016-04-20 14:20:17	frappuccino	what is -S
2016-04-20 14:20:21	na_th_an	sync
2016-04-20 14:20:23	frappuccino	oh
2016-04-20 14:20:27	na_th_an	pacman -Sc clears old packages from the cache
2016-04-20 14:20:27	frappuccino	see thats not memorable
2016-04-20 14:20:33	na_th_an	eh
2016-04-20 14:20:37	na_th_an	it's fine
2016-04-20 14:20:44	frappuccino	install is just so obvious
2016-04-20 14:20:51	na_th_an	a lot more characters to type
2016-04-20 14:21:11	frappuccino	i guess so, but they could have at least had a verbose command along with the flag
2016-04-20 14:21:15	frappuccino	for us people who forget things
2016-04-20 14:21:16	frappuccino	amirite

2016-04-22 11:19:28	frappuccino	shouldn't that be .data(

2016-04-22 11:19:40	na_th_an	yeah probably
2016-04-22 11:19:48	frappuccino	idk where to test that
2016-04-22 11:19:57	frappuccino	unit tests might handle it?
2016-04-22 11:19:59	na_th_an	when you click 'place hold'
2016-04-22 11:20:06	na_th_an	it does directs you to login

2016-04-22 11:26:16	frappuccino	its comparing a string to a string some I'm gonna say it works
2016-04-22 11:38:37	frappuccino	$input.attr('data-bad', true);
2016-04-22 11:38:45	frappuccino	is that setting 'data-bad' to true?
2016-04-22 11:38:53	frappuccino	yeah it is
2016-04-22 11:39:10	frappuccino	should that be data because its using an object rather than a string

2016-05-16 10:33:08	na_th_an	where you can add and remove columns
2016-05-16 10:33:10	na_th_an	isn't that sweet
2016-05-16 10:33:20	frappuccino	yeah thats cool
2016-05-16 10:33:37	frappuccino	i need to make something cool
2016-05-16 10:47:26	na_th_an	what if chris invites new interns to #internlandia and we don't like them and then we have to go make #fulltimelandia and not tell them about it
2016-05-16 10:47:39	frappuccino	lol
2016-05-16 10:47:40	frappuccino	may happen
2016-05-16 10:47:43	na_th_an	#salarylandia
2016-05-16 10:47:47	frappuccino	lol
2016-05-16 10:47:53	frappuccino	i mean we might have to
2016-05-16 10:47:57	frappuccino	not a big deal though
2016-05-16 10:48:02	na_th_an	yeah
2016-05-16 10:48:03	frappuccino	except for the channel config you did
2016-05-16 10:48:11	frappuccino	auto op with oclc IP etc.
2016-05-16 10:48:11	na_th_an	that's like one command
2016-05-16 10:48:13	na_th_an	to set options
2016-05-16 10:48:15	na_th_an	oh
2016-05-16 10:48:20	na_th_an	well that's not hard either
2016-05-16 10:48:37	frappuccino	magic_conch you just have to change to point at the new channel
2016-05-16 10:48:37	frappuccino	or both
2016-05-16 10:48:42	frappuccino	i kinda want that
2016-05-16 10:48:47	frappuccino	so there are two channels
2016-05-16 10:48:58	frappuccino	intern and fulltime
2016-05-16 10:49:10	frappuccino	remember that only dev interns will come to irc
2016-05-16 10:49:25	frappuccino	or at least technical
2016-05-16 10:52:30	frappuccino	bill said you could help me get started on this
2016-05-16 10:52:30	frappuccino	https://jira.oclc.org/browse/DA-20513
2016-05-16 10:53:20	na_th_an	ya so
2016-05-16 10:53:28	na_th_an	right now when you search
2016-05-16 10:53:29	frappuccino	this is DUI correct
2016-05-16 10:53:36	na_th_an	I think this will reach into DS
2016-05-16 10:53:53	na_th_an	right now you can do a search and have multiple databases in your search right
2016-05-16 10:54:01	frappuccino	yeah
2016-05-16 10:54:08	na_th_an	then you can scope down and say "only this database"
2016-05-16 10:54:11	na_th_an	or remove a database right
2016-05-16 10:54:14	frappuccino	is OrderedSearchFactory.java in DS
2016-05-16 10:54:16	na_th_an	drill down
2016-05-16 10:54:17	frappuccino	thats from your comment
2016-05-16 10:54:21	frappuccino	okay
2016-05-16 10:54:39	na_th_an	so when you do that, DUI sends an index parameter for that database
2016-05-16 10:54:45	na_th_an	like pa:some_database_symbol
2016-05-16 10:54:54	na_th_an	ok so
2016-05-16 10:55:01	na_th_an	it still sends ALL of the database IDs to firefly
2016-05-16 10:55:04	na_th_an	when you scope down
2016-05-16 10:55:09	na_th_an	that's the first issue that needs to be fixed
2016-05-16 10:55:14	na_th_an	and that's not really documented
2016-05-16 10:55:28	frappuccino	is DS an API
2016-05-16 10:55:32	frappuccino	or REST services
2016-05-16 10:55:33	frappuccino	or what
2016-05-16 10:55:35	na_th_an	DS is DiscoveryServices
2016-05-16 10:55:38	frappuccino	yeah i know
2016-05-16 10:55:46	na_th_an	it's and HTTP service
2016-05-16 10:55:49	na_th_an	I don't know a lot about it
2016-05-16 10:56:06	na_th_an	but the first thing that needs to be done is to only send the databases that are currently selected in the x-info-5-dblist parameter to firefly
2016-05-16 10:56:35	na_th_an	once the firefly request is fixed then the rest of the proquest shit can be fixed
2016-05-16 10:56:43	na_th_an	but if we don't fix that then the database names are still messed up
2016-05-16 10:57:29	frappuccino	and thats in DUI
2016-05-16 10:58:14	na_th_an	it might involve DUI and DS
2016-05-16 10:58:31	na_th_an	it's something that should probably be discussed with a tech lead on how it should be implemented
2016-05-16 10:58:54	na_th_an	there's a lot of shit that went down with that ticket and trying to get it fixed. I don't think anyone besides me and bridget really know about that database issue
2016-05-16 10:59:10	frappuccino	hm okay
2016-05-16 10:59:28	frappuccino	i forgot that DUI wasn't on ubiquity yet so I did an rm -rf on it and now i have to re check it out lol
2016-05-16 11:03:41	frappuccino	so you made a change and then it was rolled back?
2016-05-16 11:04:42	na_th_an	ya
2016-05-16 11:04:49	na_th_an	I made a bunch of changes and they were rolled back
2016-05-16 11:04:59	frappuccino	why
2016-05-16 11:05:06	na_th_an	bc we don't have git
2016-05-16 11:05:09	na_th_an	and we had to release
2016-05-16 11:05:15	frappuccino	oh lol
2016-05-16 11:05:25	na_th_an	and we kept discovering more shit that was fucked
2016-05-16 11:05:33	frappuccino	so a different fix has to happen?
2016-05-16 11:05:41	na_th_an	no more fixes
2016-05-16 11:05:52	na_th_an	fixing the problem described in the ticket exposes another problem
2016-05-16 11:05:54	frappuccino	is your fix still here
2016-05-16 11:05:59	na_th_an	no it was rolled back
2016-05-16 11:06:01	frappuccino	okay
2016-05-16 11:06:32	frappuccino	so I just swap lines 42 and 44
2016-05-16 11:07:00	na_th_an	yeah that'll "fix" the problem
2016-05-16 11:07:10	na_th_an	the properties file still needs to be fixed because it has old data
2016-05-16 11:07:20	na_th_an	and idealy we would also fix the shit code that's in there
2016-05-16 11:12:22	frappuccino	pbcopy is sweet, ive never used it
2016-05-16 11:12:43	na_th_an	ya it is
2016-05-16 11:12:55	frappuccino	do you do like "pwd | pbcopy" and stuff
2016-05-16 11:13:24	na_th_an	ya sometimes
2016-05-16 11:13:37	frappuccino	how can you echo the output of something
2016-05-16 11:13:44	na_th_an	huh
2016-05-16 11:13:54	frappuccino	i wanna do pwd + ls | pbcopy
2016-05-16 11:13:55	frappuccino	bascially
2016-05-16 11:14:06	na_th_an	pwd + ls?
2016-05-16 11:14:14	frappuccino	there's one file in the dir
2016-05-16 11:14:21	frappuccino	how do you get the path of one file
2016-05-16 11:14:39	na_th_an	echo `pwd`/`ls``
2016-05-16 11:14:52	na_th_an	extra ` at the end there
2016-05-16 11:14:55	na_th_an	but I think that'd work
2016-05-16 11:14:58	na_th_an	at least in bash
2016-05-16 11:15:01	na_th_an	idk how to fish
2016-05-16 11:20:54	frappuccino	echo (pwd)/(ls)
2016-05-16 11:21:01	frappuccino	in fish
2016-05-16 11:21:08	frappuccino	echo (pwd)/(ls) | pbcopy
2016-05-16 11:21:12	frappuccino	got what i wanted
2016-05-16 12:53:17	frappuccino	do you care about spoilers
2016-05-16 12:53:42	na_th_an	I'm probably not ever going to see civil war
2016-05-16 12:53:45	frappuccino	okay so
2016-05-16 12:53:50	frappuccino	there's this contraversial thing
2016-05-16 12:53:59	frappuccino	and captain america takes what looks like as the "bad" or "criminal" side
2016-05-16 12:54:13	frappuccino	and tony stark is like "stop you are a criminal now" and such lol
2016-05-16 12:54:16	frappuccino	but it turns out that
2016-05-16 12:54:21	frappuccino	captain america was right the whole time
2016-05-16 12:54:50	frappuccino	because america is neverw rong
2016-05-16 12:55:21	frappuccino	captain america was like defending this worldwide wanted terrorist guy
2016-05-16 12:55:27	frappuccino	because it used to be his friend
2016-05-16 12:55:40	frappuccino	but he was really just a russian brainwashed super soldier
2016-05-16 12:55:49	frappuccino	and he was activated by some 10 word prhase or something
2016-05-16 12:56:04	frappuccino	and captain america just knew that he was still "himself"
2016-05-16 12:56:11	frappuccino	so he defended him
2016-05-16 12:56:17	na_th_an	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_agent
2016-05-16 12:56:18	frappuccino	and everyone else was like stop that guy needs to be in prison
2016-05-16 12:56:20	frappuccino	yeah that
2016-05-16 12:56:34	frappuccino	but cap was right! :D he is never wrong ya know! :D
2016-05-16 12:56:38	frappuccino	i hate captain america lol
2016-05-16 12:56:46	frappuccino	tony stark is cool af
2016-05-16 12:56:47	frappuccino	and flawed
2016-05-16 12:56:49	frappuccino	like EVERY HUMAN
2016-05-16 12:56:56	frappuccino	and his character is great
2016-05-16 12:57:00	frappuccino	and he's like depressed all thet ime
2016-05-16 12:57:04	frappuccino	he is a real character
2016-05-16 16:10:19	frappuccino	emily is doing a learn to code thing
2016-05-16 16:10:21	frappuccino	i wanna help lol
2016-05-16 16:10:42	na_th_an	make sure you tell her everything that she's doing wrong
2016-05-16 16:10:52	na_th_an	"oh you should really be using inversion of control to inject these dependencies"
2016-05-16 16:11:06	frappuccino	i dont even know what that means
2016-05-16 16:11:09	frappuccino	inversion of control?
2016-05-16 16:11:58	frappuccino	lol "that if statement is sort of hard to understand, you should use demorgans to make it more readable"
2016-05-16 16:11:59	na_th_an	Dependency Injection is Inversion of Control
2016-05-16 16:12:01	na_th_an	DI is IoC
2016-05-16 16:12:13	frappuccino	"de what" "emily if you understand that you are a shit coder"
2016-05-16 16:12:15	frappuccino	lol
2016-05-16 16:12:23	na_th_an	normally like, I'd write a class that asks for all of its dependencies
2016-05-16 16:12:34	na_th_an	inversion of control is inverting that
2016-05-16 16:12:39	na_th_an	and giving a class all of its dependencies
2016-05-16 16:12:41	na_th_an	like in spring
2016-05-16 16:12:45	frappuccino	oh okay
2016-05-16 16:12:58	na_th_an	where the dependencies are configured elsewhere (annotations, java config, xml)
2016-05-17 08:52:22	frappuccino	i was at emilys last night and i was like "okay i will lay down until 9:30 then drive home"
2016-05-17 08:52:32	frappuccino	then i woke up at 1am like FUCK
2016-05-17 08:52:34	na_th_an	lol
2016-05-17 08:52:39	frappuccino	and had to drive back from capital
2016-05-17 08:52:50	frappuccino	then didnt fall asleep till like 2:15am :(
2016-05-17 08:52:52	na_th_an	I like night drives like that
2016-05-17 08:52:56	na_th_an	but that sucks
2016-05-17 08:52:59	frappuccino	no the night drive was great
2016-05-17 08:53:09	frappuccino	just goin 74 the whole way no one in my way it was great
2016-05-17 12:56:45	frappuccino	silence falls in the irc chat
2016-05-17 12:56:49	frappuccino	ope
2016-05-17 16:27:02	frappuccino	what health plan did you do
2016-05-17 16:27:08	frappuccino	there's like EPO and PPO
2016-05-17 16:27:13	frappuccino	and then like a neither one
2016-05-17 16:27:15	frappuccino	idk what they are
2016-05-17 16:27:26	na_th_an	Exclusive Provider
2016-05-17 16:27:31	na_th_an	and Preferred Provider
2016-05-17 16:27:35	frappuccino	which did you do
2016-05-17 16:27:40	na_th_an	the cheaper one
2016-05-17 16:27:42	na_th_an	PPO I think
2016-05-17 16:27:49	na_th_an	maybe EPO
2016-05-17 16:27:51	na_th_an	idk
2016-05-17 16:28:06	na_th_an	ya EPO I think
2016-05-17 16:28:19	na_th_an	with the EPO plan you can go to any specialist in the organization without a referral
2016-05-17 16:28:23	na_th_an	and it's cheaper
2016-05-17 16:28:51	na_th_an	pretty sure steven is on the same one
2016-05-17 16:28:53	frappuccino	i just failed to demorgans something
2016-05-17 16:28:57	frappuccino	imma dummy
2016-05-17 16:29:05	na_th_an	.punch frappuccino
2016-05-17 16:29:09	frappuccino	i negated and kept the or because i suck
2016-05-18 04:44:52		irc: disconnected from server
2016-05-18 09:41:22	frappuccino	if (institutionFactory.getInstitution().getInstitutionType() == 'P')
2016-05-18 09:41:28	frappuccino	is P a constant somewhere

2016-05-19 15:34:54	frappuccino	clean run worked becauase that makes sense -_-
2016-05-19 15:34:55	frappuccino	maybe clean test

2016-05-19 15:35:17	na_th_an	idk
2016-05-19 15:35:17	frappuccino	is the test command using a different version of java lol like wtf
2016-05-19 15:36:06	na_th_an	it tries not to recompile things it doesn't need to
2016-05-19 15:36:23	frappuccino	it makes no sense because I changed the lines its complainging about
2016-05-19 15:36:33	frappuccino	like before that
2016-05-19 15:36:34	frappuccino	and it worked
2016-05-19 15:36:38	frappuccino	then i did test
2016-05-19 15:36:42	frappuccino	and it was like "oh doesn't compile"
2016-05-19 15:36:47	frappuccino	and im like i literally just compiled it
2016-05-19 15:36:59	frappuccino	okay I JUST did a clean run on the entire project and it is deploy and working
2016-05-19 15:37:29	na_th_an	something something schema chages?
2016-05-19 15:38:12	frappuccino	okay im trying to test again
2016-05-19 15:38:17	frappuccino	i double checked all of my java versions
2016-05-19 15:38:23	frappuccino	intelliJ isn't complaining about the line either
2016-05-19 15:38:30	frappuccino	and is using the same exact java version obviously
2016-05-19 15:39:05	frappuccino	W
2016-05-19 15:39:05	frappuccino	T
2016-05-19 15:39:06	frappuccino	F
2016-05-19 15:39:41	na_th_an	what happens if you "gw testCompile"
2016-05-19 15:39:55	frappuccino	on only that module?
2016-05-19 15:39:55	na_th_an	idk if that's even a thing
2016-05-19 15:40:01	na_th_an	you can do "gw tasks"
2016-05-19 15:40:08	na_th_an	see if there's a task for compiling test code
2016-05-19 15:40:11	na_th_an	if it's the test code that's failing
2016-05-19 15:40:25	frappuccino	its not test code
2016-05-19 15:40:59	na_th_an	idk man
2016-05-19 15:41:19	frappuccino	what does assemble do
2016-05-19 15:41:24	frappuccino	Assembles the outputs of this project.
2016-05-19 15:41:26	frappuccino	that means nothing to me
2016-05-19 15:41:37	na_th_an	it assembles it
2016-05-19 15:41:43	na_th_an	into like, a war or jar or whatever
2016-05-19 15:42:40	frappuccino	okay what the actual fuck
2016-05-19 15:42:45	frappuccino	i just did gw clean build
2016-05-19 15:42:49	frappuccino	oh jk
2016-05-19 15:42:51	frappuccino	i did assemble
2016-05-19 15:42:52	frappuccino	though
2016-05-19 15:42:54	frappuccino	and it worked
2016-05-19 15:43:05	na_th_an	*shrug*
2016-05-19 15:43:15	frappuccino	if it can assemble that means it can compile
2016-05-19 15:43:41	frappuccino	i literally just watched the task "discoveryui-controller:compileJava" pass
2016-05-19 15:43:52	frappuccino	which is the thing that wont compile when i do tests
2016-05-19 15:44:07	na_th_an	compileGroovy?
2016-05-19 15:44:24	frappuccino	its a java class

2016-05-20 12:56:06	frappuccino	because I made one call to the method
2016-05-20 12:56:45	na_th_an	is it because you set up a call expectation
2016-05-20 12:56:53	na_th_an	that those 27 methods aren't calling
2016-05-20 12:56:59	frappuccino	no
2016-05-20 12:57:03	frappuccino	its unexpected call to blah
2016-05-20 12:57:12	frappuccino	i get why they are all calling it

2016-05-23 13:40:37	na_th_an	the CI build does it all
2016-05-23 13:40:40	na_th_an	that's what CI is
2016-05-23 13:40:47	frappi	fancy
2016-05-23 13:40:48	na_th_an	CI == build, run tests, install
2016-05-23 13:41:03	na_th_an	if the tests or bulid fails then don't install
2016-05-23 13:41:03	frappi	well yeah but idk if it had to be automated to do all that
2016-05-23 13:41:11	na_th_an	it wouldn't be CI if it didn't
2016-05-23 13:41:29	frappi	i mean if i start it manually does it do the whole process
2016-05-23 13:41:30	frappi	it does
2016-05-23 13:41:34	frappi	that was the confuse
2016-05-23 13:41:41	na_th_an	yes it does
2016-05-23 13:41:47	frappi	god it takes 20 minutes on server
2016-05-23 13:41:48	frappi	nooo
2016-05-23 13:41:53	frappi	40 last time
2016-05-23 13:41:54	frappi	great
2016-05-23 13:41:55	frappi	now what
2016-05-23 13:42:00	na_th_an	22 minutes to build, deploy, activate everything
2016-05-23 13:42:13	na_th_an	wait until it builds and see which canned regression tests you broke
2016-05-23 13:42:19	frappi	:(
2016-05-23 13:42:32	frappi	does that happen a lot
2016-05-23 13:42:39	frappi	the time it took me to do this change is ridiculous
2016-05-23 13:42:48	frappi	like the overhead, after the bug was fixed
2016-05-23 13:42:53	na_th_an	yeah
2016-05-23 13:42:57	na_th_an	you'll get used to it
2016-05-23 13:42:59	na_th_an	and better at it
2016-05-23 13:43:31	frappi	ay commmit is in fisheye

2016-05-23 13:44:05	na_th_an	a
2016-05-23 13:46:43	frappi	uhhh time spent on this
2016-05-23 13:46:43	frappi	idk
2016-05-23 13:46:44	frappi	45
2016-05-23 13:48:43	frappi	love that 85h on there lol
2016-05-23 13:49:07	frappi	$2500 from just us on that ticket
2016-05-23 13:49:17	frappi	plus anyone who was in meetings about it or spent time on it lol
2016-05-23 14:30:10	frappi	what do i do about this
2016-05-23 14:31:34	frappi	http://buildap01exdu.dev.oclc.org:8810/build/3245323/spock_specification_report
2016-05-23 14:31:58	na_th_an	find the test case
2016-05-23 14:32:01	na_th_an	run through it manually
2016-05-23 14:32:05	na_th_an	see if it's a legit failure or not
2016-05-23 14:32:18	frappi	is this like a webdriver test or what
2016-05-23 14:32:23	na_th_an	and/or reproduce the failure locally and see what's happening
2016-05-23 14:32:31	na_th_an	yeah it uses firefox and webdriver
2016-05-23 14:32:37	na_th_an	with canned responses
2016-05-23 14:32:44	frappi	i do not have this setup
2016-05-23 14:32:44	na_th_an	it doesn't actually talk to a real services
2016-05-23 14:32:52	na_th_an	you don't need to set it up
2016-05-23 14:33:24	na_th_an	iirc it's pretty easy to run from intellij
2016-05-23 14:33:46	na_th_an	http://intranet-wiki.oclc.org/wiki/Zhangy/QuickNotes/DiscoveryUI#Spock_.28spock-canned-regression_module.29

2016-05-23 15:31:36	na_th_an	she prob would have freaked out
2016-05-23 15:31:45	na_th_an	are you laughing at your gf trying to code
2016-05-23 15:31:51	frappi	no lol
2016-05-23 15:31:53	frappi	i think its cute
2016-05-23 15:32:07	na_th_an	one of my friends has been talking about trying to learn to code
2016-05-23 15:32:08	frappi	"ugh i dont understand any of this coding thing now"
2016-05-23 15:32:16	na_th_an	lol
2016-05-23 15:32:21	na_th_an	same
2016-05-23 15:32:29	frappi	"they're trying to make me do it on my own now"
2016-05-23 15:32:43	frappi	"accidentally had a equal sign in there and it was screwing the whole thing up"
2016-05-23 15:32:48	frappi	i was like "yep that happens lol"\
2016-05-23 15:33:03	na_th_an	"try adding more ='s"

2016-05-23 15:33:34	na_th_an	I'm only half kidding
2016-05-23 15:33:36	na_th_an	bc javascript
2016-05-23 15:33:41	frappi	i dont think its javascript
2016-05-23 15:33:41	na_th_an	you could have =
2016-05-23 15:33:43	na_th_an	and want ===
2016-05-23 15:33:49	frappi	i think its still html css
2016-05-23 15:33:51	na_th_an	= everywhere
2016-05-23 15:34:02	frappi	i hate ====
2016-05-23 15:34:05	frappi	===*
2016-05-23 15:34:10	na_th_an	I hate !== more
2016-05-23 15:34:13	frappi	like just have is
2016-05-23 15:34:19	frappi	python if statement normally look great
2016-05-23 15:34:22	frappi	its cool when you can do
2016-05-23 15:34:25	frappi	if thing is not thing2:
2016-05-23 15:34:30	frappi	readable af
2016-05-23 15:34:36	na_th_an	yeah that is nice syntax
2016-05-23 15:34:47	na_th_an	doing a build
2016-05-23 15:34:49	na_th_an	I hope this passes
2016-05-23 15:34:52	na_th_an	and my shit still works
2016-05-23 15:34:56	na_th_an	then I can commit MegaDUI
2016-05-23 15:35:00	na_th_an	if I want to
2016-05-23 15:35:01	frappi	if object not in list:
2016-05-23 15:35:05	frappi	is also i thing you can do
2016-05-23 15:35:06	frappi	dope
2016-05-23 15:35:15	na_th_an	yeah 'in' is pretty cool too
2016-05-23 15:35:23	frappi	if char in string:
2016-05-23 15:35:27	na_th_an	I'm gonna be waiting awhile for Jinbin's stuff to be done
2016-05-23 15:35:30	frappi	i love python sometimes
2016-05-23 15:35:35	na_th_an	and that needs to be done before my stuf
2016-05-23 15:36:14	frappi	ohhh doing a geb spock thing is much harder than just spocok
2016-05-23 15:37:20	na_th_an	my mac charger is really hot
2016-05-23 15:37:22	frappi	so is it a priority to fix the canned regression test
2016-05-23 15:37:28	na_th_an	kinda
2016-05-23 15:37:29	frappi	na_th_an: yeah dont catch on fire
2016-05-23 15:37:31	na_th_an	those usually pass
2016-05-23 15:37:33	na_th_an	is it a legit failure?
2016-05-23 15:37:38	frappi	i think
2016-05-23 15:37:39	frappi	idk
2016-05-23 15:37:40	na_th_an	like have you tried to do in manually and it's broken
2016-05-23 15:37:54	na_th_an	bc if you broke it with your changes then it's a problem
2016-05-23 15:37:59	na_th_an	(you probably did)
2016-05-23 15:38:04	frappi	i think so
2016-05-23 15:38:38	frappi	this does not seem to be testing what it describes lol
2016-05-23 15:38:45	frappi	"test when the user selects a database, that database appears in the Collections facet"
2016-05-23 15:38:49	frappi	numberOfResults > 0
2016-05-23 15:38:51	frappi	what
2016-05-23 15:38:56	frappi	um
2016-05-23 15:39:06	frappi	guys i dont think thats correct
2016-05-23 15:40:14	na_th_an	*shrug*
2016-05-23 15:40:47	frappi	lets see if this run works...
2016-05-23 15:41:12	na_th_an	same
2016-05-23 15:41:28	frappi	this is fancy
2016-05-23 15:41:39	na_th_an	?
2016-05-23 15:41:47	frappi	running this from intelliJ
2016-05-23 15:41:56	frappi	it is sitting here not doing anything lol
2016-05-23 15:42:04	frappi	its stuck
2016-05-23 15:42:06	frappi	loading
2016-05-23 15:42:08	na_th_an	lol
2016-05-23 15:42:38	frappi	can it like... load
2016-05-23 15:42:41	frappi	wtf ci
2016-05-23 15:43:22	frappi	how long is it about to sit here not doing anything
2016-05-23 15:43:31	na_th_an	you might have to set the hostname
2016-05-23 15:43:38	na_th_an	01 and 02 are 'normal' ci servers
2016-05-23 15:43:43	na_th_an	and then 03 is our canned regression server
2016-05-23 15:43:45	na_th_an	iirc
2016-05-23 15:44:15	frappi	its using discoveryui.ent.oclc.org
2016-05-23 15:44:18	frappi	omg it just finished loading
2016-05-23 15:44:19	frappi	wtf
2016-05-23 15:44:22	frappi	it just worked eon local
2016-05-23 15:44:50	frappi	i think you were joking
2016-05-23 15:44:53	frappi	eric does not
2016-05-23 15:45:07	na_th_an	I did at one point
2016-05-23 15:45:13	frappi	ah
2016-05-23 15:45:16	frappi	then what
2016-05-23 15:45:17	na_th_an	and I did tell them I didn't want meds
2016-05-23 15:45:51	na_th_an	then I switched majors, started paying more attention to my mental health, did some psychedelics, and have enough will to keep myself alive every day
2016-05-23 15:46:10	frappi	sounds positive
2016-05-23 15:46:35	na_th_an	yeah it's going alright
2016-05-23 15:46:49	frappi	discoveryui.ent.oclc.org
2016-05-23 15:46:50	frappi	that is ci right
2016-05-23 15:47:06	na_th_an	that's the load balancer
2016-05-23 15:47:14	frappi	okay
2016-05-23 15:48:08	frappi	so if it passed on local now what
2016-05-23 15:48:11	frappi	run it again on qb?
2016-05-23 15:48:32	frappi	eric wtf
2016-05-23 15:48:39	na_th_an	I mean
2016-05-23 15:48:45	na_th_an	going part time is better than failing classes
2016-05-23 15:48:48	frappi	i guess
2016-05-23 15:48:58	frappi	a good question though is why cant he deal with the busy semesters
2016-05-23 15:48:59	frappi	we all did
2016-05-23 15:49:00	frappi	we are fine
2016-05-23 15:49:54	na_th_an	well the worrying thing
2016-05-23 15:50:01	na_th_an	if he can'd deal with school and a busy semester
2016-05-23 15:50:09	na_th_an	can he deal with work?
2016-05-23 15:50:15	frappi	idk man
2016-05-23 15:50:26	na_th_an	half of school is supposed to just show that you're dedicated enough and will work hard for a long term goal
2016-05-23 15:50:27	frappi	work has already enveloped me lol
2016-05-23 15:50:30	na_th_an	and he uhh

2016-05-24 15:14:46	na_th_an	do you know about tail call recursion
2016-05-24 15:14:50	frappi	yes
2016-05-24 15:15:16	na_th_an	he's taking about a compiler that would take a recursive function you wrote
2016-05-24 15:15:31	na_th_an	and turn it into a tail call recursive function (which I don't think compilers can do automatically)
2016-05-24 15:15:40	na_th_an	then optimize that tail call into a loop
2016-05-24 15:15:43	na_th_an	then unroll the loop
2016-05-24 15:15:50	na_th_an	but it's still processing the data structure backwards? idk
2016-05-24 15:15:54	frappi	unrolling
2016-05-24 15:15:59	frappi	does that just mean like

2016-05-26 10:42:31	frappi	-_-
2016-05-26 10:43:02	frappi	i am oddly forgiving for still using java 7 in disco
2016-05-26 10:43:12	frappi	like in a lack of resources way
2016-05-26 10:43:30	na_th_an	since we're using groovy we don't need it THAT badly
2016-05-26 10:43:38	frappi	also that
2016-05-26 10:43:53	frappi	but also migrating everything to java 8 would probably cause issues and everything is working so
2016-05-26 10:44:00	frappi	everything is *sort of* working so
2016-05-26 10:49:38	na_th_an	how long did eric complain about GPM
2016-05-26 10:49:51	frappi	what is GPM
2016-05-26 10:49:53	na_th_an	and how long would it take to give the name of a fucked up artist that always pisses him off

2016-05-27 09:57:37	na_th_an	I do definitely picture them getting drunk at happy hour, leaving the bar together to go home, and then having drunk sex together
2016-05-27 09:57:52	na_th_an	we'd have to have happy hour closer to their houses so that abby won't drive
2016-05-27 09:57:53	frappi	like a thing thats already happened? lol

2016-05-27 13:56:53	na_th_an	I think the thing that makes me annoyed with him
2016-05-27 13:56:58	frappi	lol
2016-05-27 13:57:01	na_th_an	is that he doesn't take responsibility for his actions

2016-05-27 13:57:07	na_th_an	like, him failing classes and he just doesn't give a shit

2016-05-27 13:57:12	na_th_an	"oh that happened to me"
2016-05-27 13:57:18	na_th_an	like there was nothing he could have done to stop it
2016-05-27 13:57:30	na_th_an	it's just a thing that happened, like rain or an exit ramp being closed
2016-05-27 13:57:35	na_th_an	not his fault at all
2016-05-27 13:57:51	na_th_an	he's never like "yeah I fucked up, I should really try harder"
2016-05-27 13:58:06	na_th_an	"man I've gotten in after 9:30 every day this week and left before 5. I should work harder."
2016-05-27 13:58:12	na_th_an	these just aren't things he thinks

2016-05-31 12:34:21	frappi	me and my dad made up this game 5 years ago where you stanad 20 feet apart and throw the frisbee as hard as you can
2016-05-31 12:34:45	frappi	and the other person has to catch it
2016-05-31 12:34:52	na_th_an	oh lol
2016-05-31 12:34:53	frappi	if you drop it the other person gets a point
2016-05-31 12:35:02	na_th_an	what if it's a shitty throw
2016-05-31 12:35:03	frappi	if its out of range (like a ball in baseball) you get a point
2016-05-31 12:35:10	na_th_an	oh
2016-05-31 12:35:18	frappi	if its out of range and you go for it but don tget they gget a point
2016-05-31 12:35:22	frappi	its like baseball hitting rules
2016-05-31 12:35:29	frappi	catching does nothing, just keep the game going
2016-05-31 12:35:31	frappi	its really fun
2016-05-31 12:35:34	frappi	and kind of scary
2016-05-31 12:40:02	na_th_an	I got my first complements on my car
2016-05-31 12:40:09	frappi	ayy
2016-05-31 12:40:22	na_th_an	dude's like "ya I had one of those. I put like 1200 into the engine and lowered it so it was 2 inches off the ground"
2016-05-31 12:40:36	na_th_an	"it had over 400hp, I'd do 90mph off the on ramp
2016-05-31 12:41:29	frappi	uhu
2016-05-31 12:41:36	frappi	im sure your honda civic had 400hp
2016-05-31 12:41:39	frappi	:P
2016-05-31 12:41:54	frappi	and I can doo 90mph off an on ramp too with 178 horsepower so
2016-05-31 12:41:57	na_th_an	it's possible, but I doubt you doubled the stock hp with $1200
2016-05-31 12:42:07	frappi	but i don't because I'm not a fuck
2016-05-31 12:42:10	frappi	yeah
2016-05-31 12:42:16	na_th_an	yeah I just do like 75mph :)
2016-05-31 12:42:16	frappi	im sure you could
2016-05-31 12:42:18	frappi	but im sure he didn
2016-05-31 12:42:21	na_th_an	yeah
2016-05-31 12:42:26	frappi	yeah i come on the freeway at like 74 if i can
2016-05-31 12:42:28	na_th_an	he was telling me about he coils he put on
2016-05-31 12:42:41	frappi	but yeah if i floored it i could be at 100 by the time I got on probably
2016-05-31 12:42:54	frappi	and also thats a torque
2016-05-31 12:42:57	frappi	thing
2016-05-31 12:43:03	frappi	horsepower != torque
2016-05-31 12:43:20	na_th_an	well your transmission should maximize your torque
2016-05-31 12:43:38	frappi	yeah more horsepower probably means more torque but its not a direct correlation
2016-05-31 12:43:48	frappi	anyway that guy is full of shit
2016-05-31 12:44:06	frappi	if you want 400 horsepower and to drive on the freeway at 90mph get a mustang gt
2016-05-31 12:44:12	na_th_an	lol yeah
2016-05-31 12:44:22	frappi	thats the most feasible way to get > 400 hp
2016-05-31 12:44:26	na_th_an	yeah
2016-05-31 12:44:33	na_th_an	if all you want is a cheap fast drive

2016-06-01 09:02:51	frappi	this method is confusing
2016-06-01 09:03:14	na_th_an	no it isn't
2016-06-01 09:03:55	na_th_an	what method
2016-06-01 09:03:59	na_th_an	are you going to continue there
2016-06-01 09:04:00	frappi	isActive
2016-06-01 09:04:02	na_th_an	or not
2016-06-01 09:04:04	na_th_an	oh
2016-06-01 09:04:06	na_th_an	no it isn't
2016-06-01 09:04:09	na_th_an	?
2016-06-01 09:04:11	frappi	when will it ever return false
2016-06-01 09:04:17	na_th_an	never
2016-06-01 09:04:20	frappi	wtf
2016-06-01 09:04:26	na_th_an	but with togglz
2016-06-01 09:04:29	frappi	why is it called isActive
2016-06-01 09:04:30	na_th_an	if you set the feature to 'false'
2016-06-01 09:04:35	na_th_an	in the featuers file
2016-06-01 09:04:47	na_th_an	when you call isActive on teh feature manager
2016-06-01 09:04:49	na_th_an	it'll say false
2016-06-01 09:04:55	na_th_an	if it's active in the feature file
2016-06-01 09:05:00	na_th_an	then it calls this method
2016-06-01 09:05:28	na_th_an	if it's active in the feature file then the feature is active and I put the parameter on the feature state
2016-06-01 09:05:46	frappi	is the method checking to see if something is active?
2016-06-01 09:05:52	frappi	because thats what it seems like its doing by the name
2016-06-01 09:06:10	na_th_an	it's an implementation for togglz
2016-06-01 09:06:15	na_th_an	it's how togglz works

2016-06-01 12:46:49	na_th_an	and thought about how that used to be standard
2016-06-01 12:46:54	na_th_an	I used to have dual CRT monitors
2016-06-01 12:47:06	na_th_an	it's crazy how far things have come
2016-06-01 12:48:19	frappi	no lol
2016-06-01 13:01:08	frappi	so like
2016-06-01 13:01:19	frappi	developing a web app couldn't happen without developers right
2016-06-01 13:01:26	frappi	people who can write software like you and me
2016-06-01 13:01:38	na_th_an	sure
2016-06-01 13:02:06	frappi	and we need time to develop our shit, we dont wanna test
2016-06-01 13:02:15	frappi	if we spend tons of time testing, we wont be developing
2016-06-01 13:02:17	frappi	so we need qa
2016-06-01 13:02:24	na_th_an	yes
2016-06-01 13:03:01	frappi	but im assuming you and I are both smart enough and thoughtful enough to design a not shitty UI that doesn't look like shit and is usable
2016-06-01 13:03:17	frappi	so like wtf does ux do
2016-06-01 13:03:31	frappi	like i understand what they do
2016-06-01 13:03:33	frappi	but
2016-06-01 13:03:33	na_th_an	they seriously don't do a lot
2016-06-01 13:03:35	na_th_an	like
2016-06-01 13:03:50	na_th_an	if I were a manager i'd be kinda resentful toward binaebi
2016-06-01 13:03:55	na_th_an	because she probably gets paid the same as like, bill
2016-06-01 13:04:03	na_th_an	but she doesn't have to deal with nearly the same shit bill does
2016-06-01 13:04:11	frappi	i mean i understand having product people
2016-06-01 13:04:22	na_th_an	the kind of emergencies that UX has are much less serious than actual production emergencies
2016-06-01 13:04:41	frappi	because someone needs to be able to understand the market and understand what our memebrs want and stuff
2016-06-01 13:04:49	frappi	and understand what the product needs to be to make money blah blah blah
2016-06-01 13:04:54	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-01 13:04:57	frappi	i dont want to and probably can't successfully do that shit
2016-06-01 13:05:00	na_th_an	they do a lot of market problem analysis kinda stuff
2016-06-01 13:05:07	frappi	but I can design a good looking and usable UI
2016-06-01 13:05:13	frappi	with thoughtful messages
2016-06-01 13:05:15	frappi	that make sense
2016-06-01 13:05:32	frappi	like, maybe UX was neccessary 20 years ago
2016-06-01 13:05:45	na_th_an	yeah but like
2016-06-01 13:05:51	frappi	because without good HTML5 frameworks, no way in hell I could design a good looking and usable UI
2016-06-01 13:05:53	frappi	but now
2016-06-01 13:05:53	na_th_an	someone has to 'own' that
2016-06-01 13:06:02	na_th_an	'own' the look of the UI
2016-06-01 13:06:10	na_th_an	and approve it
2016-06-01 13:06:22	na_th_an	like, some of the things that devs make are really shitty
2016-06-01 13:06:27	frappi	what if we had front end devs
2016-06-01 13:06:28	frappi	who did that
2016-06-01 13:06:39	na_th_an	that's a ridiculous thought
2016-06-01 13:06:43	frappi	more artistically creative devs who are good at javascript
2016-06-01 13:06:45	na_th_an	because then we'd have to have developers with skills
2016-06-01 13:06:50	frappi	lol
2016-06-01 13:06:53	frappi	rockstars
2016-06-01 13:06:58	na_th_an	was just gonna say that lol
2016-06-01 13:07:03	na_th_an	we need some front end rockstars
2016-06-01 13:07:28	frappi	how much money does oclc waste on unnecessary positions i wonder
2016-06-01 13:07:39	frappi	not as much since last year lol
2016-06-01 13:08:55	frappi	i just received a giant packet from wanda belcher
2016-06-01 13:09:46	frappi	OH THATS THE STRAIGHT DOPE!
2016-06-01 13:10:06	frappi	"congrats on your two year anniversary with OCLC, here's your better retirement plan" nice
2016-06-01 13:10:06	frappi	lol
2016-06-01 14:30:06	frappuccino	so like
2016-06-01 14:30:22	frappuccino	im glad that the people choosing to do shootings are so bad at it that they only killed 2 people so far
2016-06-01 14:30:43	frappuccino	as far as we know at least
2016-06-01 14:30:46	na_th_an	yeah it is kinda amazing how low some of the death tolls are in things like this
2016-06-01 14:30:55	frappuccino	like what actually happened
2016-06-01 14:30:57	na_th_an	idk
2016-06-01 14:31:05	na_th_an	and everything you read about it right now is probably false
2016-06-01 14:31:06	frappuccino	because they weren't going for most kills
2016-06-01 14:31:24	frappuccino	they *could* have walked into a crowd of people and spun around shooting
2016-06-01 14:31:26	na_th_an	if there's one thing I've learned on reddit it's that media reporting is shit
2016-06-01 14:31:34	na_th_an	especially in situtiations like this
2016-06-01 14:31:56	frappuccino	yeah
2016-06-01 14:32:12	na_th_an	I can't wait for the conspiracy theories
2016-06-01 14:32:18	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-01 14:32:23	frappuccino	"it never really happened"
2016-06-01 14:32:25	frappuccino	sandy hook
2016-06-01 14:32:26	frappuccino	wtf
2016-06-01 14:32:34	frappuccino	like why are there conspiracies about that
2016-06-01 14:34:13	na_th_an	because human psychology
2016-06-01 14:34:19	na_th_an	I could talk about it for awhile
2016-06-01 14:34:36	frappuccino	i hate flat earthers
2016-06-01 14:34:42	frappuccino	i hate 9/11 conspiratards
2016-06-01 14:34:46	frappuccino	moon landing shit

2016-06-01 14:34:53	na_th_an	it's pretty ridiculous
2016-06-01 14:34:54	frappuccino	about
2016-06-01 14:34:54	frappuccino	it
2016-06-01 14:35:00	na_th_an	then there's things like contrails
2016-06-01 14:35:04	na_th_an	and homepathic medicine
2016-06-01 14:35:06	frappuccino	omg
2016-06-01 14:35:12	na_th_an	I know people that believe in that shit

2016-06-01 14:56:43	frappuccino	like last summer
2016-06-01 14:59:42	na_th_an	yeah

2016-06-01 15:00:28	frappuccino	i remember him saying pedantic a lot
2016-06-01 15:30:48	frappuccino	i walked around at capital yesterday because me and emily went on a walk from her house and it was weird
2016-06-01 15:31:00	frappuccino	i was like 'i will never be in any of these buildings again'
2016-06-01 15:31:01	frappuccino	kinda sad
2016-06-01 15:31:09	na_th_an	I hated school
2016-06-01 15:31:19	na_th_an	I have had no nostalgia towards OSU really

2016-06-08 15:50:18	na_th_an	which is maybe kinda valid
2016-06-08 15:50:19	beefnprokboi	lol
2016-06-08 15:50:29	na_th_an	but he probably doesn't know about MTP
2016-06-08 15:50:33	beefnprokboi	except you know if he did he just read it somewhere
2016-06-08 15:50:43	beefnprokboi	i will proudly say I know nothing about MTP lol
2016-06-08 15:51:10	na_th_an	it's basically why you can't mount your phone's SD card on your computer when you plug it in anymore
2016-06-08 15:51:21	na_th_an	before you'd unmount it from your phone and mount it on your PC
2016-06-08 15:51:27	na_th_an	since it can't be mounted in both places
2016-06-08 15:51:33	na_th_an	MTP is a media transfer protocol
2016-06-08 15:51:46	na_th_an	for transferring media between the phone and PC without havaing to unmount it from the phone
2016-06-08 15:51:51	na_th_an	so both systems can access it at the same time
2016-06-08 15:51:53	na_th_an	it works... pretty well
2016-06-08 15:51:57	na_th_an	when it works
2016-06-08 15:52:01	na_th_an	which isn't that often on Linux
2016-06-08 15:52:11	na_th_an	although tbh it's been a along time since I've tried
2016-06-08 15:52:25	beefnprokboi	im about to ask jeff to erase the logs
2016-06-08 15:52:31	beefnprokboi	wrong chat oops
2016-06-08 16:48:35	frappi	ugh
2016-06-08 16:48:41	na_th_an	:(
2016-06-08 16:50:59	frappi	even after we said groovy he was like
2016-06-08 16:51:10	frappi	"bit shift left" yeah i fucking know eric lo.
2016-06-08 16:51:16	na_th_an	yeah and then I'm like
2016-06-08 16:51:19	na_th_an	"well it can be a lot of things"
2016-06-08 16:51:21	na_th_an	so he's like
2016-06-08 16:51:25	na_th_an	"then why did he ask?"
2016-06-08 16:51:28	na_th_an	uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
2016-06-08 16:51:37	frappi	because IT CAN BE A LOT OF THINGS
2016-06-09 09:27:36	frappi	everyones here except eric lol
2016-06-09 11:26:54	frappi	view-source:http://firefly-readonly.prod.oclc.org/firefly-service/rs/sru/registrydiscoverylists?operation=searchRetrieve&version=1.1&x-info-5-serviceName=FireflySRUPage&recordPacking=xml&query=local.type+%3D+%22coursereserves%22&maximumRecords=1&startRecord=1
2016-06-09 11:27:06	frappi	easiest way to parse the 14694 out of num records?
2016-06-09 11:27:08	frappi	in groovy
2016-06-09 11:29:38	na_th_an	parse the what now?
2016-06-09 11:29:58	na_th_an	you want the number of records?
2016-06-09 11:30:04	frappi	yeah
2016-06-09 11:30:10	na_th_an	well since this is a one off script
2016-06-09 11:30:17	frappi	XmlSlurper
2016-06-09 11:30:18	na_th_an	I'd pobably use regex
2016-06-09 11:30:18	frappi	is what i found
2016-06-09 11:30:24	frappi	http://groovy-lang.org/processing-xml.html
2016-06-09 11:30:27	frappi	cool af
2016-06-09 11:30:28	na_th_an	I'd regex that bitch personally
2016-06-09 11:32:43	frappi	dude that is insane
2016-06-09 11:32:49	frappi	URL initRequest = new URL(BASE_URL + "&${MAX_REC_PARAM}=1&${START_REC_PARAM}=${startRecord}")
2016-06-09 11:32:49	frappi	String result = initRequest.getText()
2016-06-09 11:32:49	frappi	def parsed = new XmlSlurper().parseText(result)
2016-06-09 11:32:49	frappi	int numRecords = parsed.numberOfRecords.toInteger()
2016-06-09 11:32:54	frappi	groovy is officially the shit
2016-06-09 11:33:06	na_th_an	oh wow
2016-06-09 11:33:08	frappi	that worked
2016-06-09 11:33:10	na_th_an	in java that'd be...
2016-06-09 11:33:13	na_th_an	shit
2016-06-09 11:33:16	frappi	insane
2016-06-09 11:33:28	frappi	im in awe
2016-06-09 16:08:28	na_th_an	I can't believe abby pulled the 8 hours card on jeff
2016-06-09 16:08:30	na_th_an	like
2016-06-09 16:08:33	na_th_an	wow
2016-06-09 16:08:50	na_th_an	that's why I tried to tell her that lunch doesn't count, so she wouldn't say something like that
2016-06-09 16:09:17	frappi	lol
2016-06-09 16:09:25	frappi	"i got here at 8:30" like thats early

2016-06-09 16:10:07	frappi	but he stays way after me I think
2016-06-09 16:10:19	na_th_an	jinbin gets here early

2016-06-13 10:00:15	na_th_an	I haven't heard of stephen or abby having a date as long as I've known them
2016-06-13 10:00:34	frappuccino	i feel like some people just tell themselves that so they dont get rejected or something
2016-06-13 10:00:40	frappuccino	'cant get hurt if you dont try'
2016-06-13 10:00:52	na_th_an	yeah I guess

2016-06-13 11:16:28	na_th_an	more likely: eric isn't telling the full truth

2016-06-13 11:20:34	na_th_an	I felt bad for him
2016-06-13 11:20:41	na_th_an	until I was in classes with him

2016-06-13 11:21:12	na_th_an	and not only did he not take that help, he refuses to even admit to himself that he needs help
2016-06-13 11:21:45	na_th_an	as far as I can tell he's just totally okay with the situation he's in
2016-06-13 12:37:06	na_th_an	"not tired today"

2016-06-13 13:52:10	na_th_an	so don't use mock()
2016-06-13 13:52:24	na_th_an	@Mock
2016-06-13 13:52:26	na_th_an	iirc
2016-06-13 13:52:31	na_th_an	mockito is different
2016-06-13 13:52:33	frappuccino	mock is a mockito thing too
2016-06-13 13:52:39	frappuccino	i know
2016-06-13 13:52:41	na_th_an	I've never seen it used
2016-06-13 13:53:04	frappuccino	its used here other placces
2016-06-13 13:53:11	na_th_an	idk
2016-06-13 13:53:15	frappuccino	either way it didnt work with the @Mock annotation
2016-06-13 13:53:16	na_th_an	it seems like your mock isn't being played
2016-06-13 13:53:23	na_th_an	are you missing a class annotation?
2016-06-13 13:53:30	frappuccino	no? idts?
2016-06-13 13:53:42	na_th_an	idts?
2016-06-13 13:53:44	na_th_an	oh
2016-06-13 13:53:46	na_th_an	i remember now
2016-06-13 13:54:30	na_th_an	you have the right imports right?
2016-06-13 13:54:34	frappuccino	yah
2016-06-13 13:54:37	frappuccino	im making changes
2016-06-13 13:54:39	frappuccino	not writing my own class
2016-06-13 13:54:39	na_th_an	you aren't accidentially importing a gmock thing?
2016-06-13 13:54:43	frappuccino	no
2016-06-13 13:54:50	frappuccino	i searched the entire class for gmock jeez
2016-06-13 13:54:55	frappuccino	stop thinking there is gmock here lol
2016-06-13 13:55:03	na_th_an	what class is this
2016-06-13 13:55:09	frappuccino	BibServiceESL
2016-06-13 13:55:16	frappuccino	there isn't a conversion service mock in it yet
2016-06-13 13:55:17	frappuccino	Test
2016-06-13 13:55:18	frappuccino	btw
2016-06-13 13:55:20	frappuccino	^^^
2016-06-13 13:55:57	na_th_an	are your matchers not getting hit?
2016-06-13 13:56:04	na_th_an	does it return not null if you match anything
2016-06-13 13:56:33	frappuccino	hold on
2016-06-13 13:57:02	frappuccino	found it
2016-06-13 13:57:12	frappuccino	some of the methods use a different instance of owcCustomQuery
2016-06-13 13:57:18	frappuccino	so there's not match for that method call
2016-06-13 14:03:03	frappuccino	you think abby knows that
2016-06-13 14:04:14	na_th_an	idk
2016-06-13 14:04:17	na_th_an	maybe
2016-06-13 14:52:32	na_th_an	plz don't be a new bug
2016-06-13 14:52:39	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-13 14:55:14	frappuccino	idk what jeff is trying to say
2016-06-13 14:55:35	na_th_an	that the thing was fucked up before thursday
2016-06-13 14:55:41	na_th_an	it isn't a new bug
2016-06-13 14:59:26	frappuccino	unless my parsing is like HUGELY wrong i dont get why this would happen
2016-06-13 14:59:45	na_th_an	is it possible
2016-06-13 14:59:53	na_th_an	that it happened because firefly gave you back shit/incomplete/wrong data?
2016-06-13 15:00:08	na_th_an	because that's my guess
2016-06-13 15:00:21	frappuccino	i guess so
2016-06-13 15:00:37	frappuccino	its pretty possible that there is a bug in my parsing
2016-06-13 15:00:54	na_th_an	i'd argue thata it's more likely that firefly sucks
2016-06-13 15:01:03	na_th_an	especially since you re-ran your script and it found it
2016-06-13 15:01:11	frappuccino	true
2016-06-13 15:01:22	frappuccino	i ran it twice thursday once we cleaned up and it found nothing tiwce
2016-06-13 15:01:24	frappuccino	twice*
2016-06-13 15:01:41	na_th_an	yeah because that afternoon firefly felt like returning some data
2016-06-13 15:01:45	na_th_an	and it did consistently
2016-06-13 15:01:48	na_th_an	that afternoon
2016-06-13 15:01:53	na_th_an	and now it's different because it's monday
2016-06-13 15:01:55	na_th_an	seems reasonable to me
2016-06-13 15:02:00	na_th_an	given what I know about firefly/find
2016-06-13 15:02:16	na_th_an	"oh a cloud just flew over. let's see if the results changed"
2016-06-13 15:02:34	na_th_an	"I think Kim Jong Un just finished a meal. Let's see if Perf is up"
2016-06-13 15:02:56	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-13 15:03:54	frappuccino	i think i found a bug in my script
2016-06-13 15:04:29	na_th_an	don't tell anyone
2016-06-13 15:04:31	frappuccino	where if the very last record in the entire set is bad (each set is 1000) then it wont be found
2016-06-13 15:04:32	na_th_an	blame find
2016-06-13 15:04:43	na_th_an	two hard things in coding
2016-06-13 15:04:44	na_th_an	off by one
2016-06-13 15:05:23	frappuccino	fixed and rerunning... same results
2016-06-13 15:05:40	na_th_an	change it to sets of 999
2016-06-13 15:06:04	frappuccino	thats an argument so that was super easy to do because i am best code man
2016-06-13 15:06:22	na_th_an	I have no fucking idea how to use kibana
2016-06-13 15:06:28	na_th_an	"make a dashboard"
2016-06-13 15:06:31	na_th_an	fuck
2016-06-13 15:06:57	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-13 15:07:17	frappuccino	2 corrupted courses
2016-06-13 15:07:24	frappuccino	im betting that it can happen to modified courses
2016-06-13 15:07:31	na_th_an	huh
2016-06-13 15:07:34	frappuccino	both of these courses were modified over the weekend
2016-06-13 15:07:34	na_th_an	what do you mean
2016-06-13 15:07:37	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-13 15:07:38	frappuccino	but created before the fix
2016-06-13 15:07:41	na_th_an	that's why they found them
2016-06-13 15:07:48	frappuccino	true
2016-06-13 15:07:53	na_th_an	they found the error because they tried to modify them over the weekend
2016-06-13 15:08:01	na_th_an	and THANK GOD they were created before the fix
2016-06-13 15:08:04	frappuccino	i swear this script would have found them lol
2016-06-13 15:08:21	na_th_an	blame firefly
2016-06-13 15:08:45	frappuccino	ope second one dateModified "2016-05-30T16:35:29.769"
2016-06-13 15:08:47	frappuccino	thats not good
2016-06-13 15:08:54	frappuccino	... that just has to be firefly
2016-06-13 15:08:56	na_th_an	no that's fine
2016-06-13 15:08:58	frappuccino	how would i have no found that
2016-06-13 15:09:05	frappuccino	no it should have been fixed on thursday
2016-06-13 15:09:08	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-13 15:09:11	frappuccino	when i ran this "find all the bad shit script"
2016-06-13 15:09:14	na_th_an	all of them should have
2016-06-13 15:09:19	na_th_an	assuming your script and firefly worked
2016-06-13 15:09:39	na_th_an	it's not indicative of more course reserves being corrupted though
2016-06-13 15:12:23	frappuccino	they only found one
2016-06-13 15:12:28	frappuccino	how the fuck did i not find that one
2016-06-13 15:12:39	frappuccino	does firefly give back stuff in the same order everytime
2016-06-13 15:12:47	frappuccino	i could have tried the 999 thign
2016-06-13 15:12:50	frappuccino	i also fixed the bug though
2016-06-13 15:13:16	frappuccino	it makes sense that I would have found it today if there was a new course reserve and it pushed one at the end of a page back

2016-06-13 15:56:05	frappuccino	because the answer is so easy
2016-06-13 15:56:09	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-13 15:56:11	na_th_an	so why the fuck are you asking me
2016-06-13 15:56:39	na_th_an	I just
2016-06-13 15:56:43	na_th_an	I don't know what to do about this
2016-06-13 15:56:57	frappuccino	what lol
2016-06-13 15:57:01	frappuccino	what do you mean lololol
2016-06-13 15:57:17	na_th_an	idk like
2016-06-13 15:57:22	na_th_an	can we still make eye contact
2016-06-13 15:57:25	frappuccino	lolol
2016-06-13 15:59:05	frappuccino	...
2016-06-13 15:59:22	na_th_an	?
2016-06-13 15:59:27	frappuccino	idk
2016-06-13 16:00:10	frappuccino	good talk
2016-06-13 16:10:47	frappuccino	i fixed the off by one thing thursday and ran it again and got no new ones
2016-06-13 16:10:51	frappuccino	not off by one but yeah
2016-06-13 16:10:58	frappuccino	misses the last one in the set
2016-06-13 16:11:15	na_th_an	well that's an off by one error
2016-06-13 16:11:23	frappuccino	so
2016-06-13 16:11:37	frappuccino	between each record in teh respond there is </record><record>
2016-06-13 16:11:59	frappuccino	so everytime I saw <record> i was like "okay end that record and start processing the next"
2016-06-13 16:12:03	frappuccino	but for the last one
2016-06-13 16:12:05	frappuccino	there is no <record>
2016-06-13 16:12:13	frappuccino	to end it.. because there's nothing after it
2016-06-13 16:12:15	frappuccino	so i just changed it to
2016-06-13 16:12:19	na_th_an	do you mean </record>
2016-06-13 16:12:27	frappuccino	no
2016-06-13 16:12:40	frappuccino	because it has to start processing the first record on the first one
2016-06-13 16:12:41	na_th_an	oh
2016-06-13 16:12:44	na_th_an	I see what you mean
2016-06-13 16:12:50	frappuccino	the </record><record> are always on the same line next to each other
2016-06-13 16:12:53	frappuccino	it processes by line
2016-06-13 16:13:05	frappuccino	so i had to just do this
2016-06-13 16:13:05	frappuccino	if (it.contains(RECORD_TAG) || it.contains(END_RECORD_TAG))
2016-06-13 16:13:39	na_th_an	are you arguing that it was not an off by one error because of this?
2016-06-13 16:13:42	na_th_an	or what
2016-06-13 16:13:56	na_th_an	I'd call that an off by one error
2016-06-13 16:14:16	frappuccino	off by one is generally liek an index thing
2016-06-13 16:14:25	frappuccino	i guess that could be called an off by one error
2016-06-13 16:14:42	na_th_an	yeah it's not like
2016-06-13 16:14:44	na_th_an	you forgot a -1
2016-06-13 16:14:58	na_th_an	but I'd still call that an off by one
2016-06-13 16:14:58	frappuccino	thats what off one is to me
2016-06-13 16:15:37	na_th_an	any time you forget to check the edge case when processing a bunch of records and miss the first/last one is an off by one imo
2016-06-13 16:16:00	frappuccino	that makes sense
2016-06-13 16:16:30	na_th_an	they just USUALLY manifest as fucking up 0 based indexes or something like that
2016-06-14 08:41:09	frappuccino	like smoke weed 8 hours a day 7 days a week lol :P
2016-06-14 08:41:19	na_th_an	lol
2016-06-14 08:41:27	na_th_an	hey now it's not 8 hours a day
2016-06-14 08:42:03	frappuccino	6
2016-06-14 08:42:08	frappuccino	6-12
2016-06-14 08:42:09	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-14 08:42:19	na_th_an	I've been smoking less than I used to
2016-06-14 08:42:21	na_th_an	and not even smoking
2016-06-14 08:42:46	frappuccino	oil rigging whatever that is
2016-06-14 08:42:50	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-14 08:42:56	na_th_an	it's the same as vaping
2016-06-14 08:43:03	frappuccino	except THC out the max
2016-06-14 08:43:06	na_th_an	there's not a ton of smoke shit that you're inhaling
2016-06-14 08:43:09	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-14 08:43:23	na_th_an	but that's not really harmful
2016-06-14 09:39:59	frappuccino	im going to caf im assuming youre good

2016-06-14 10:24:29	frappuccino	like pnc or discover or facebook or google lol
2016-06-14 10:24:52	na_th_an	and you use parts of the URL
2016-06-14 10:24:56	na_th_an	to mutate your password
2016-06-14 10:24:58	na_th_an	based on the website?
2016-06-14 10:25:36	frappuccino	yes i guess so lol

2016-06-14 11:56:44	frappuccino	how long till this install is over
2016-06-14 11:56:55	na_th_an	way after lunch
2016-06-14 11:56:58	na_th_an	we're finishing group 2
2016-06-14 11:57:01	na_th_an	then they have to do group 3
2016-06-14 11:57:04	na_th_an	which involves installing dui
2016-06-14 11:57:06	na_th_an	rolling back dui
2016-06-14 11:57:09	na_th_an	then installing it again
2016-06-14 11:57:15	frappuccino	:(
2016-06-14 11:57:17	na_th_an	and verifying it on the install and the rollback
2016-06-14 11:57:21	frappuccino	boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
2016-06-14 11:57:24	na_th_an	yup
2016-06-14 11:57:28	frappuccino	are you eating at your desk
2016-06-14 11:57:33	na_th_an	yeah I think I am
2016-06-14 11:57:38	frappuccino	im too tired for this shit
2016-06-14 11:57:43	na_th_an	hopefully mark will be done with his cheps
2016-06-14 11:57:46	na_th_an	chips

2016-06-14 12:24:32	frappuccino	oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit
2016-06-14 12:24:44	na_th_an	did you poop yourself?
2016-06-14 12:24:56	frappuccino	the largest size you can do in firefly is 500
2016-06-14 12:25:00	frappuccino	i was doing 100
2016-06-14 12:25:01	na_th_an	lololol
2016-06-14 12:25:02	frappuccino	1000*
2016-06-14 12:25:11	frappuccino	i was missing every other 500 records
2016-06-14 12:25:18	na_th_an	nice
2016-06-14 12:25:20	frappuccino	running with 500 now
2016-06-14 12:25:38	na_th_an	nbd
2016-06-14 12:25:45	frappuccino	only found 4
2016-06-14 12:32:40	frappuccino	all fixed
2016-06-14 12:35:03	na_th_an	how many did you find
2016-06-14 12:35:06	frappuccino	4
2016-06-14 12:35:20	na_th_an	word
2016-06-14 12:39:13	frappuccino	still dont know how i found more without changing anything
2016-06-14 12:39:35	na_th_an	new course reserves were created so you got a different set of 500
2016-06-14 12:39:53	frappuccino	maybe
2016-06-14 12:40:15	frappuccino	im curious about how theres only 4 that i just found that
2016-06-14 12:40:20	frappuccino	when there were 20 in the other set of 500
2016-06-14 13:22:35	frappuccino	what was dat
2016-06-14 13:22:47	na_th_an	what
2016-06-14 13:54:48	frappuccino	na_th_an: i have not done much today....
2016-06-14 13:57:10	na_th_an	me either
2016-06-14 13:57:23	na_th_an	this kinda happens around install times I've noticed
2016-06-14 13:57:30	na_th_an	it's dumb
2016-06-14 13:57:48	na_th_an	I might have this kibana thing done today tho
2016-06-14 13:57:50	na_th_an	"done"
2016-06-14 13:57:55	na_th_an	until they decided to change what they want
2016-06-14 14:26:37	frappuccino	im still fucking around with these unit tests this is awful
2016-06-14 14:27:32	frappuccino	this might be worse than search controller
2016-06-14 14:28:12	na_th_an	what class is it?
2016-06-14 14:28:31	frappuccino	BibServiceESLTest
2016-06-14 14:28:43	frappuccino	its like awkwardly mixing mocking and normal unit testing
2016-06-14 14:30:47	frappuccino	i almost said "the thing you dont go to because it gives you cancer"
2016-06-14 15:06:10	frappuccino	what
2016-06-14 15:06:11	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-14 15:06:28	na_th_an	what?
2016-06-14 15:06:35	frappuccino	what is eric talking about
2016-06-14 15:06:38	na_th_an	what
2016-06-14 15:06:40	na_th_an	oh
2016-06-14 15:06:42	na_th_an	I saw
2016-06-14 15:06:44	na_th_an	just now
2016-06-14 15:06:46	na_th_an	wtf
2016-06-14 15:07:12	frappuccino	fuck you jetbrains
2016-06-14 15:07:36	na_th_an	eric would be pissed off if he bought a sockt wrench because he's used to being able to loosen and tighten at the same time with the same wrench
2016-06-14 15:07:45	na_th_an	"but eric it's much more convenient. It's just an extra step to change the direction."
2016-06-14 15:07:57	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-14 15:07:58	na_th_an	but it's different, and not what he was expecting
2016-06-14 15:08:00	na_th_an	thus wrong
2016-06-14 15:08:27	na_th_an	"My old wrench let me loosen or tighten anything! Now I need sockets for each and every bolt size? Ridiculous!"
2016-06-14 15:08:42	na_th_an	while every single professional mechanic swears by their socket set
2016-06-14 15:08:48	na_th_an	eric is over there struggling with his cresent wrench
2016-06-14 15:08:51	frappuccino	i hate him
2016-06-14 15:08:51	na_th_an	"It's better I swear!"
2016-06-14 15:09:16	frappuccino	so lets review what he was complaining about
2016-06-14 15:09:26	frappuccino	he was accidentally holding down some keys?
2016-06-14 15:09:33	frappuccino	so he wrote a bunch of shit to a file?
2016-06-14 15:09:36	frappuccino	instead of undoing
2016-06-14 15:09:38	frappuccino	he clsoed the filed
2016-06-14 15:09:56	frappuccino	hoping the changes would go away
2016-06-14 15:09:59	frappuccino	then reopened
2016-06-14 15:10:05	frappuccino	then got mad that changes were still there
2016-06-14 15:10:06	na_th_an	1) eric fell asleep
2016-06-14 15:10:14	na_th_an	2) he mashed some keys
2016-06-14 15:10:39	frappuccino	i bet he tried to make changes and fucked everything up
2016-06-14 15:10:47	frappuccino	why wouldn't he just undo "leaning" on a few keys
2016-06-14 15:10:52	frappuccino	my first thought we be to revert lol
2016-06-14 15:10:58	frappuccino	if i couldnt undo
2016-06-14 15:11:10	na_th_an	I hate how intellij still uses 'revert' in the GUI when you're using git
2016-06-14 15:11:11	frappuccino	i cant believe he thought closing the file would get rid of the changes lol
2016-06-14 15:11:17	frappuccino	yeah thats annoying
2016-06-14 15:11:21	frappuccino	but i dont use that so
2016-06-14 15:11:23	frappuccino	well i guess i do
2016-06-14 15:11:24	frappuccino	sometimes
2016-06-14 15:11:26	frappuccino	but still
2016-06-14 15:11:27	na_th_an	I've used that a few times
2016-06-14 15:11:28	frappuccino	dont really care
2016-06-14 15:11:32	na_th_an	ya it's nbd
2016-06-14 15:11:35	na_th_an	I mean
2016-06-14 15:11:37	na_th_an	fuck jetbrains
2016-06-14 15:11:40	na_th_an	trash product
2016-06-14 15:11:46	frappuccino	is he gonna dodge
2016-06-14 15:11:57	na_th_an	ofc
2016-06-14 15:12:05	frappuccino	did he expect us to be like "ohh yaaa autosave sucksksssss"
2016-06-14 15:13:05	na_th_an	ya that one time when I alt-tabbed to my browser and all my frontend resources autosaved and then refreshed my browser
2016-06-14 15:13:07	na_th_an	that was shit
2016-06-14 15:13:11	na_th_an	was not expecting
2016-06-14 15:13:22	na_th_an	I ended up having one of those farts where it's kinda wet because I was so surprised
2016-06-14 15:13:25	na_th_an	I had to go home
2016-06-14 15:13:28	na_th_an	fucking intellij
2016-06-14 15:13:45	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-14 15:16:07	frappuccino	"now some file is edited and I dont even understand how"
2016-06-14 15:16:12	frappuccino	"did you edit it"
2016-06-14 15:16:18	frappuccino	"i leaned on a few keys"
2016-06-14 15:16:24	frappuccino	... it seems like you understand how
2016-06-14 15:16:27	frappuccino	or youre lying lol
2016-06-14 15:16:41	na_th_an	it's just another case of Eric making a mistake
2016-06-14 15:16:48	na_th_an	in this case, probably falling asleep and messing up a file
2016-06-14 15:16:57	na_th_an	and the results having nothing to do with his mistake
2016-06-14 15:17:03	na_th_an	but everything to do with intellij sucking
2016-06-14 15:29:06	frappuccino	what was that about
2016-06-14 15:29:29	na_th_an	making graphs
2016-06-14 15:29:32	na_th_an	check out my graphs
2016-06-14 15:29:41	na_th_an	cathy won't tell me what graphs to make
2016-06-14 15:29:47	na_th_an	so rashmi just said to make something and be smart
2016-06-14 15:29:51	na_th_an	and if they don't like it too bad
2016-06-14 15:29:58	na_th_an	she's been fine since she's come back
2016-06-14 15:30:04	na_th_an	other than her voice and head nodding
2016-06-14 15:34:45	frappuccino	yeah

2016-06-14 15:42:55	na_th_an	I'd pass that on a code review but I'm not a tech lead
2016-06-14 15:43:11	frappuccino	idk why that mock isnt working
2016-06-14 15:44:09	frappuccino	should i just not mock it

2016-06-20 15:08:34	keveloper	keveloper the developer what you want me to develop for
2016-06-20 15:09:04	keveloper	that should be in my fish config
2016-06-20 15:10:59	keveloper	trump or clinton
2016-06-20 15:11:25	keveloper	like they both suck
2016-06-20 15:11:40	keveloper	and was that poll actually correct
2016-06-20 15:12:18	na_th_an	I've lost all ability to work
2016-06-20 15:12:22	na_th_an	what poll
2016-06-20 15:12:23	keveloper	lol
2016-06-20 15:12:32	keveloper	something showed hillary polling way above trump
2016-06-20 15:12:40	na_th_an	oh I think I know what you're talking about
2016-06-20 15:12:46	keveloper	is that true
2016-06-20 15:12:46	na_th_an	the huffington post aggregation over time
2016-06-20 15:13:02	na_th_an	it's true that something like 77% of americans have a disfavorable view of trump
2016-06-20 15:13:08	keveloper	yeah
2016-06-20 15:13:08	na_th_an	and yes her polling is better I believe
2016-06-20 15:13:10	keveloper	sounds right
2016-06-20 15:13:16	keveloper	they both suck
2016-06-20 15:13:20	keveloper	but i think hillary sucks less
2016-06-20 15:13:22	na_th_an	at this point I don't think he has a chance
2016-06-20 15:13:29	na_th_an	hillary definitely sucks less
2016-06-20 15:13:31	keveloper	thats good at least
2016-06-20 15:13:44	na_th_an	I'm interested to see what's gonna happen with Gary Johnson
2016-06-20 15:13:51	keveloper	i have no idea who that is
2016-06-20 15:13:58	na_th_an	he's the libertarian candidate
2016-06-20 15:14:00	keveloper	oh okay
2016-06-20 15:14:09	na_th_an	some people like Jill Stein
2016-06-20 15:14:12	na_th_an	she's the green party candidate
2016-06-20 15:14:21	na_th_an	but I do not unless her views on medicine have changed dramatically
2016-06-20 15:14:28	keveloper	i bet its just gonna end up being hillary honestly
2016-06-20 15:14:42	na_th_an	I bet that too
2016-06-20 15:14:48	na_th_an	if you don't count my literal bet on trump
2016-06-20 15:14:48	keveloper	which i honestly dont care about that much because the president can't do *that* much
2016-06-20 15:14:57	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-20 15:15:06	keveloper	i think people forget about that lol
2016-06-20 15:15:11	keveloper	like the whole checks and balances thign
2016-06-20 15:15:22	na_th_an	there are SOME things that are gonna happen that will have long term importance
2016-06-20 15:15:27	na_th_an	like decisions to go bomb libya
2016-06-20 15:15:33	na_th_an	or supreme court appointments
2016-06-20 15:15:38	keveloper	yeah
2016-06-20 15:15:42	na_th_an	but yeah for the most part I agree
2016-06-20 15:15:51	keveloper	i hope she doesn't go bomb libya
2016-06-20 15:15:54	na_th_an	she already did
2016-06-20 15:15:57	na_th_an	so
2016-06-20 15:15:59	keveloper	can we just not go bomb anybody
2016-06-20 15:16:01	na_th_an	no
2016-06-20 15:16:07	keveloper	no bombing
2016-06-20 15:16:16	keveloper	if i was president i would like never attack anyone lol
2016-06-20 15:16:24	keveloper	unless someone was like "we will attack you"
2016-06-20 15:16:30	keveloper	i'd be like uh no thank you
2016-06-20 15:16:44	keveloper	here have some bombs

2016-06-20 15:17:03	na_th_an	whenever I think about the whole situtaion in the middle easth I think about this

2016-06-20 15:17:46	keveloper	lol
2016-06-20 15:18:41	keveloper	i think not bombing anyone is good
2016-06-20 15:18:46	keveloper	not bombing is good
2016-06-20 15:18:48	keveloper	no bombs
2016-06-20 15:19:07	na_th_an	there are sometimes that bombing is a better idea than not
2016-06-20 15:19:07	keveloper	and also no killing like 50 gay people thats not good either
2016-06-20 15:19:08	keveloper	wtf
2016-06-20 15:19:13	keveloper	yeah i guess so
2016-06-20 15:19:17	keveloper	like bombing china
2016-06-20 15:19:18	keveloper	no just kidding
2016-06-20 15:19:37	na_th_an	I think a strong argument can be made that dropping the nukes on Japan ended up being more moral than fighting a traditional war
2016-06-20 15:19:41	keveloper	if i was president my speeches would be like "can we just like stop shooting people?"
2016-06-20 15:19:51	na_th_an	yeah I wouldn't be able to do this politician crap
2016-06-20 15:19:54	keveloper	na_th_an: ehhhhh ya
2016-06-20 15:19:57	keveloper	civilians though
2016-06-20 15:19:58	na_th_an	I'd be up there like "fucking seriously guys?"
2016-06-20 15:20:09	keveloper	"like what the fuck? why?"
2016-06-20 15:20:45	na_th_an	"Stay home and think about yourself. Think about your neighbor. Try not to shoot anyone tomorrow maybe? Fuck."
2016-06-20 15:21:16	na_th_an	if the war had continued it would have lasted another few years
2016-06-20 15:21:32	na_th_an	the overall loss of life would have been higher on both sides
2016-06-20 15:21:39	na_th_an	lost economic potential
2016-06-20 15:21:43	keveloper	"So like, gay people don't really affect you, its not like they are trying to kiss you? So why do you care? Stop shooting them please?"
2016-06-20 15:21:47	na_th_an	our relations ended up being pretty good
2016-06-20 15:22:07	keveloper	ya so that we dont do it again lol
2016-06-20 15:22:31	keveloper	did you hear about the plan of dropping bats carrying grenades
2016-06-20 15:22:39	na_th_an	I did not
2016-06-20 15:22:43	keveloper	but it was dropped after the manhattan project took off
2016-06-20 15:23:00	keveloper	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat_bomb

2016-06-20 15:24:41	keveloper	lol
2016-06-20 15:24:56	keveloper	The bat bomb was conceived by a Pennsylvania dentist named Lytle S. Adams, a friend of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt
2016-06-20 15:25:02	keveloper	oh thats how this dumb ass idea got so far

2016-06-20 16:23:15	frappuccino	like
2016-06-20 16:23:17	frappuccino	so hard
2016-06-20 16:23:22	frappuccino	but im not gonna say anything
2016-06-20 16:23:41	frappuccino	"yeah especially when they stop showing up to class"
2016-06-20 16:23:55	frappuccino	"yeah especially when they dont turn in projects"
2016-06-20 16:24:11	na_th_an	"especially when the don't show up to group projects with your actual friends"
2016-06-20 16:24:15	frappuccino	"yeah especially when they dont do anything in group projects"
2016-06-20 16:24:17	na_th_an	"after you said you would"
2016-06-20 16:24:22	frappuccino	"yeah especially when they dont show up for finals"
2016-06-20 16:24:23	na_th_an	"and then you stop responding to texts"
2016-06-20 16:24:31	frappuccino	"yeah especially when they fail stats 3 times
2016-06-20 16:24:32	na_th_an	"and then don't even come to happy hour"
2016-06-20 16:24:41	na_th_an	because they're SO busy studying
2016-06-20 16:24:48	frappuccino	"yeah especially when they take 6 years to get a 4 year degree"
2016-06-20 16:24:49	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-20 16:25:04	frappuccino	"yeah especially when they act like they are so busy studying but can't pass the class"
2016-06-20 16:25:34	na_th_an	I have no idea what he does with his time
2016-06-20 16:25:40	na_th_an	my working theory
2016-06-20 16:25:49	na_th_an	is that he wakes up really late and doesn't start his day until 11
2016-06-20 16:26:00	na_th_an	which means he doesn't actually get dressed and shit until 12 or so
2016-06-20 16:26:07	na_th_an	so then it's class/food for a bit
2016-06-20 16:26:12	na_th_an	and he'll study until 7 or so
2016-06-20 16:26:19	na_th_an	then it's "man I'm so tired gotta do other shit"
2016-06-20 16:26:26	na_th_an	and he procrastinates on stuff he should be doing all night
2016-06-20 16:26:28	na_th_an	stays up way too late
2016-06-20 16:26:31	na_th_an	boom
2016-06-20 16:26:34	frappuccino	lol
2016-06-20 16:26:34	na_th_an	repeat
2016-06-20 16:26:38	frappuccino	college wasn't that hard
2016-06-20 16:26:48	frappuccino	like it was a lot of work
2016-06-20 16:26:51	na_th_an	OSU was pretty hard
2016-06-20 16:27:04	na_th_an	it depends on the professors
2016-06-20 16:27:05	frappuccino	well yeah it was difficult
2016-06-20 16:27:08	frappuccino	but like in the scheme of things
2016-06-20 16:27:17	na_th_an	but a lot of them will put things on tests to fuck with people
2016-06-20 16:27:23	frappuccino	you finished in 4.5 years with what 3.?
2016-06-20 16:27:32	na_th_an	maybe a 3.0 idk

2016-06-22 08:38:28	na_th_an	I hadn't ever thought that
2016-06-22 08:38:42	na_th_an	she's like the stereotypical manager that doesn't know anything
2016-06-22 08:38:50	na_th_an	and speaks manager talk
2016-06-22 08:38:59	keveloper	idk if this is mean but i hope she doesn't go far because she doesn't seem to have good intentions

2016-06-22 08:43:49	keveloper	and i get emails from them about this ubiquity shit, and they copy paste an error, and they are like "how do i fix this?"
2016-06-22 08:43:53	keveloper	and me and jeff are like idfk?
2016-06-22 08:43:56	keveloper	then we google it

2016-06-22 08:44:10	keveloper	so i replied with a link
2016-06-22 08:44:12	keveloper	like
2016-06-22 08:44:23	na_th_an	yeah but did it tell you how to fix it in ubiquity?
2016-06-22 08:44:29	keveloper	lol what

2016-06-22 10:44:38	keveloper	can you help instruct? I think it's a GREAT idea for you and Nathan to get that out in front of folk! Start with our teams and then see how we can "socialize" it
2016-06-22 10:44:41	na_th_an	the OG JJ
2016-06-22 10:44:41	keveloper	says bill

2016-06-22 10:50:01	keveloper	emphasize git learning curve lol because there definitely is one
2016-06-22 10:50:22	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-22 12:37:43	na_th_an	based on what I know about Eric I'm going to say the problem is on his end and not OVH
2016-06-22 12:37:50	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:37:53	na_th_an	unless it's OVH's fault for not just starting over
2016-06-22 12:37:58	keveloper	hahahahhahaa
2016-06-22 12:38:41	keveloper	yeah he is wrong lol
2016-06-22 12:38:51	keveloper	"i figured it out"
2016-06-22 12:38:54	keveloper	"ovh sucks"
2016-06-22 12:38:56	keveloper	lolol
2016-06-22 12:40:09	keveloper	wtf is he doing
2016-06-22 12:40:18	keveloper	i think he is just fucking up his ssh config without knowing whats going on lol
2016-06-22 12:40:24	keveloper	i didnt have to do anything when i got my server
2016-06-22 12:40:32	na_th_an	yeah I have no idea why he's touching his ssh config
2016-06-22 12:40:47	keveloper	what
2016-06-22 12:40:48	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:41:00	na_th_an	I have no words
2016-06-22 12:41:04	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:42:55	keveloper	lol the fact that he has the confidence to blame this entire thing on ovh
2016-06-22 12:43:38	na_th_an	I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm sure about this: these problems are not caused by my lack of understanding
2016-06-22 12:44:04	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:44:10	keveloper	like
2016-06-22 12:44:11	keveloper	just
2016-06-22 12:44:11	keveloper	what
2016-06-22 12:44:48	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:45:00	na_th_an	obviously you didn't
2016-06-22 12:45:06	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:45:09	keveloper	"its OVHs fault"
2016-06-22 12:45:11	na_th_an	this is ridiculous
2016-06-22 12:45:17	na_th_an	just once I'd like him to be like
2016-06-22 12:45:20	na_th_an	"oh I didn't know that"
2016-06-22 12:45:21	keveloper	"i was wrong"
2016-06-22 12:45:23	na_th_an	"oh I didn't understand that"
2016-06-22 12:45:33	keveloper	p sure i've already done that today
2016-06-22 12:48:40	keveloper	"so far my experience with ovh has not been great"
2016-06-22 12:50:25	keveloper	saying "i have servers in chicago and quebec" sounds so much cooler than it is lol
2016-06-22 12:52:25	na_th_an	at this point I'm just impressed at his ability to truly believe that every problem he has is somebody else's fault
2016-06-22 12:52:52	na_th_an	and to not feel any kind of anxiety over taking 6 years to graduate college and sucking at or not even doing your job
2016-06-22 12:53:31	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:53:39	keveloper	whats the dep for java web apps called
2016-06-22 12:53:45	keveloper	quinton is asking for help

2016-06-22 12:53:51	na_th_an	what?
2016-06-22 12:53:59	keveloper	he wants to deploy it
2016-06-22 12:54:03	keveloper	im like idk ask a team member
2016-06-22 12:54:17	na_th_an	that's not a question that you can answer without knowing a lot more about the project
2016-06-22 12:54:34	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:54:39	keveloper	its maven
2016-06-22 12:54:45	keveloper	and not spring
2016-06-22 12:54:46	keveloper	its battelle
2016-06-22 12:54:51	keveloper	so im assuming j2ee webapp ftw
2016-06-22 12:54:55	keveloper	mvn run?
2016-06-22 12:54:57	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:55:13	na_th_an	idk, package a war and drop it in tomcat?
2016-06-22 12:55:23	keveloper	thats a maven task
2016-06-22 12:55:30	keveloper	intelliJ tomcat config
2016-06-22 12:55:30	na_th_an	what
2016-06-22 12:55:36	keveloper	to deploy to tomcat
2016-06-22 12:55:38	keveloper	maven plugin
2016-06-22 12:55:44	na_th_an	you're just saying words
2016-06-22 12:55:53	na_th_an	I have no idea how you're trying to connect them
2016-06-22 12:56:19	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:56:26	keveloper	intelliJ tomcat run config is one way
2016-06-22 12:56:35	keveloper	maven plugin to deploy artifact to tomcat is another
2016-06-22 12:56:38	na_th_an	are you saying that it's one way to run a project
2016-06-22 12:56:42	keveloper	yes
2016-06-22 12:56:43	na_th_an	or one way that he knows he can run his project
2016-06-22 12:56:49	keveloper	to run a project
2016-06-22 12:56:52	keveloper	im assuming his
2016-06-22 12:56:59	keveloper	i've made the assumption that its a j2ee webapp
2016-06-22 12:56:59	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 12:57:03	keveloper	so
2016-06-22 12:57:09	na_th_an	if we're just listing possible ways that a java webapp could be started we'll be here all day
2016-06-22 12:57:11	keveloper	i feel like im supposed to like gradle more
2016-06-22 12:57:13	keveloper	but i just dont
2016-06-22 12:57:19	keveloper	i dont like it very much at all lol
2016-06-22 12:57:23	na_th_an	he should be able to figure some shit out by looking at the pom
2016-06-22 12:57:27	na_th_an	gradle is okay
2016-06-22 12:57:31	keveloper	i like maven more
2016-06-22 12:57:32	keveloper	i've decided
2016-06-22 12:57:40	na_th_an	if we tried to what we do in gradle in maven it'd be way way worse
2016-06-22 12:57:42	keveloper	or maybe i've just seen shit build.gradles
2016-06-22 12:57:43	na_th_an	trust me
2016-06-22 12:57:55	na_th_an	a basic pom.xml is fine and good
2016-06-22 12:58:06	na_th_an	but once you start trying to do more than a basic build with it, maven become awful
2016-06-22 12:58:08	keveloper	like what
2016-06-22 12:58:10	keveloper	the REL thing?
2016-06-22 12:58:14	keveloper	i guess so
2016-06-22 12:58:18	keveloper	our build shit so gross
2016-06-22 12:58:19	keveloper	build.gradle
2016-06-22 12:58:24	na_th_an	I'm not going to say it isn't gross
2016-06-22 12:58:27	na_th_an	and it could be a lot better
2016-06-22 12:58:35	na_th_an	but if it were maven it'd be worse
2016-06-22 12:58:38	keveloper	i dont even know how to do a dependency in gradle
2016-06-22 12:58:41	keveloper	is that the classpath thing
2016-06-22 12:58:53	na_th_an	there's a dependency closure in gradle
2016-06-22 12:59:02	na_th_an	you add dependencies there
2016-06-22 12:59:11	keveloper	and what are the configurations things
2016-06-22 12:59:18	na_th_an	idk what you're talking about
2016-06-22 12:59:41	keveloper	its a thing
2016-06-22 12:59:55	na_th_an	I'm not saying it's not a thing
2016-06-22 13:00:02	na_th_an	I'm just saying idk what thing you're talking about
2016-06-22 13:00:12	keveloper	http://git.ent.oclc.org/projects/DISC/repos/discoveryui/browse/build.gradle#436
2016-06-22 13:00:17	keveloper	ya i was linking
2016-06-22 13:01:16	na_th_an	dealing with dependencies of dependencies
2016-06-22 13:01:28	na_th_an	dependencies will pull in other logging/testing frameworks that we don't want
2016-06-22 13:01:30	na_th_an	so we exclude them
2016-06-22 13:01:31	keveloper	maybe i'll write a gradle thing
2016-06-22 13:01:46	keveloper	i wanna write that pretty looking thing that was gonna basically be momentum but
2016-06-22 13:02:08	keveloper	i wonder if i could write a good android launcher
2016-06-22 13:02:58	keveloper	to be fast pretty and productive
2016-06-22 13:03:02	keveloper	i kinda wanna do that
2016-06-22 13:03:28	na_th_an	I was trying to think of VR game ideas yesterday
2016-06-22 13:03:32	keveloper	ok
2016-06-22 13:03:46	na_th_an	where you could have like 1-3 people on their phones
2016-06-22 13:03:50	na_th_an	and then 1 person in VR
2016-06-22 13:03:53	keveloper	ooh
2016-06-22 13:03:56	na_th_an	and have some kind of a multiplayer experience
2016-06-22 13:04:25	keveloper	you could do some assitant type thing like that wii u super mario
2016-06-22 13:04:46	keveloper	or the person on the phone could touch to drop drone things or something that you shoot
2016-06-22 13:04:55	keveloper	the vr person is defending something
2016-06-22 13:04:57	na_th_an	I was thinking co-op would be good
2016-06-22 13:05:00	keveloper	the phone person is attacking it
2016-06-22 13:05:05	keveloper	by dropping like minions
2016-06-22 13:05:07	keveloper	or other way around
2016-06-22 13:05:24	keveloper	like baloon tower defence
2016-06-22 13:05:30	keveloper	except you are in vr attack the towers
2016-06-22 13:05:34	keveloper	and the player puts them down
2016-06-22 13:06:13	keveloper	i'd wanna make some dope gun mechanisms
2016-06-22 13:06:25	keveloper	like when you reload you have to pull the clip out the put a new one in the cock it
2016-06-22 13:06:52	keveloper	and to switch firing modes you have to look at the side of the gun and flip the switch
2016-06-22 13:07:12	keveloper	and you lean down close to the controller to look in the scope
2016-06-22 13:07:28	keveloper	and you are making your way through some field thing and there is cover
2016-06-22 13:07:36	keveloper	and the person on the phone is like order troops or something
2016-06-22 13:07:37	na_th_an	battledome has an assault rifle with a scope
2016-06-22 13:07:39	keveloper	like strategy style
2016-06-22 13:07:41	na_th_an	I was wrecknig with it last night
2016-06-22 13:07:44	keveloper	strategy vs fps
2016-06-22 13:07:56	keveloper	do you like my idea lol
2016-06-22 13:08:04	na_th_an	yeah it's got good parts to it
2016-06-22 13:08:13	keveloper	>:O THE WHOLE THING IS GOOD lol
2016-06-22 13:08:13	na_th_an	multiplayer tower defense would be cool
2016-06-22 13:40:54	keveloper	so
2016-06-22 13:40:57	keveloper	quinton just said
2016-06-22 13:41:30	keveloper	"so according to guys here, if i want to acces it through "localhost:8080" I'll have to manually copy the front end from the repository voer to tomcat's ROOT folder very time i make a change"
2016-06-22 13:41:37	keveloper	"it makes sense but seems wrong"
2016-06-22 13:41:38	keveloper	i said
2016-06-22 13:41:47	keveloper	lol thats how you did it in 1994 yeah
2016-06-22 13:41:57	keveloper	jeez battelle tf are you doing
2016-06-22 13:42:35	na_th_an	don't be quite so facicious
2016-06-22 13:42:40	na_th_an	that's more 2004 than 1994
2016-06-22 13:42:42	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 13:42:50	keveloper	okay but still
2016-06-22 13:42:58	na_th_an	that's the answer patrick would give you
2016-06-22 13:43:10	keveloper	lol
2016-06-22 13:44:11	keveloper	do you wanna meet today or something to talk about what we're gonna do for friday
2016-06-22 13:44:22	na_th_an	I think we should wait until next friday
2016-06-22 13:44:27	keveloper	why
2016-06-22 13:44:41	na_th_an	unless we don't want to actually do a deployment
2016-06-22 13:44:45	na_th_an	and only talk about git
2016-06-22 13:45:22	keveloper	yeah i think thatd be good
2016-06-22 13:45:41	keveloper	git focussed one time to cover things that aren't covered in the typical workflow
2016-06-22 13:45:42	keveloper	like reset
2016-06-22 13:45:46	keveloper	idk how jeff didn't know about that
2016-06-22 13:45:53	keveloper	should probably show source tree stuff for a sec
2016-06-22 13:45:53	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-22 13:46:00	na_th_an	talk about intellij and CLI a bit
2016-06-22 13:46:02	keveloper	i always have sourcetree ready to back me out of git holes lol
2016-06-22 13:46:03	keveloper	yeah
2016-06-22 13:46:05	na_th_an	bc mark won't use the cli for some reason
2016-06-22 13:46:12	na_th_an	I've never used sourcetree
2016-06-22 13:46:18	keveloper	its incredible
2016-06-22 13:46:19	na_th_an	I think it would be good to mention but idk if we should show it
2016-06-22 13:46:20	keveloper	so do you wanna meet
2016-06-22 13:46:26	na_th_an	intellij + cli is already a lot
2016-06-22 13:46:30	na_th_an	adding a 3rd thing is even more
2016-06-22 13:46:44	keveloper	i'd rather new git devs use source tree over cli

2016-06-27 10:18:40	keveloper	and i was like "is this a preset theme or did you set up this homepage" and she was like "i set it up
2016-06-27 10:18:58	keveloper	idk what youre huhing
2016-06-27 10:19:06	na_th_an	not like
2016-06-27 10:19:08	na_th_an	"huh?"
2016-06-27 10:19:11	na_th_an	but
2016-06-27 10:19:13	na_th_an	huh.
2016-06-27 10:19:16	keveloper	oh i got you
2016-06-27 10:19:17	keveloper	idk
2016-06-27 10:19:20	keveloper	maybe for stephene
2016-06-27 10:19:22	keveloper	stephen
2016-06-27 10:19:23	keveloper	idk dude
2016-06-27 10:19:24	na_th_an	idk

2016-06-27 10:19:45	keveloper	but they are getting here tomorrow
2016-06-27 10:19:47	keveloper	dammit amazon
2016-06-27 10:19:57	na_th_an	I feel like she's said things in the past to the effect of her not wanting to date stephen because of religion but I could be compeltely and totally wrong about that
2016-06-27 10:20:35	keveloper	the bible app would be explained by her not setting up that homepage but it being from a theme
2016-06-27 10:21:03	keveloper	which i think is the case because i was like "what is this dancing person icon" and she couldn't rememeber what the app was for like 20 seconds
2016-06-27 10:21:05	na_th_an	how would the app get there in the first place?
2016-06-27 10:21:17	na_th_an	I've never had a bible app on my phone
2016-06-27 10:21:19	na_th_an	personally
2016-06-27 10:21:27	na_th_an	and I grew up in a very religious family
2016-06-27 10:21:37	keveloper	when you download themes all of the icons come with
2016-06-27 10:21:41	keveloper	even if you dont have the apps
2016-06-27 10:21:48	keveloper	and when you click on them it takes you to them in the store
2016-06-27 10:21:59	keveloper	is what i assume happened
2016-06-27 10:22:01	na_th_an	oh
2016-06-27 10:22:04	na_th_an	idk
2016-06-27 10:22:17	na_th_an	it doesn't do that with the cyanogenmod themes
2016-06-27 10:22:25	keveloper	nova launcher
2016-06-27 10:22:29	keveloper	it might not happen on nova launcher
2016-06-27 10:22:34	keveloper	some other ones i've tried do that
2016-06-27 10:23:13	na_th_an	I haven't done much/any theming on my phones
2016-06-27 10:23:23	na_th_an	ok so that journal of thing
2016-06-27 10:23:27	keveloper	i like to try to get the best look i can get
2016-06-27 10:23:29	na_th_an	the same exact firefly query works in perf
2016-06-27 10:23:31	na_th_an	fails in prod
2016-06-27 10:23:34	keveloper	na_th_an: yeah
2016-06-27 10:23:38	keveloper	huh
2016-06-27 10:23:40	keveloper	oh
2016-06-27 10:23:51	keveloper	like when you change the domain to perf
2016-06-27 10:23:55	keveloper	but leave the request the same
2016-06-27 10:26:31	na_th_an	yes
2016-06-27 10:26:36	na_th_an	you change -perf.ent
2016-06-27 10:26:39	na_th_an	to -readonly.prod
2016-06-27 10:26:42	keveloper	lolol
2016-06-27 10:26:54	na_th_an	we never emailed dsisupport about this right?

2016-06-27 11:37:28	keveloper	talk about first gen technology this smart watch man
2016-06-27 11:37:47	na_th_an	I'm pretty fucking happy with my vive for it being first gen tech
2016-06-27 11:37:52	na_th_an	it amazes me
2016-06-27 11:38:09	keveloper	my watch is infuriatingly slow
2016-06-27 11:38:23	keveloper	im just gonna write my own lightweight os and run it on it

2016-06-27 11:43:07	na_th_an	makes me sad
2016-06-27 11:43:17	keveloper	i bet its actually good
2016-06-27 11:43:24	na_th_an	I bet it is
2016-06-27 11:43:27	keveloper	because first gen is not
2016-06-27 11:43:30	keveloper	and it dropped fast
2016-06-27 11:43:31	na_th_an	:(
2016-06-27 11:43:35	keveloper	i think im about to stop wearing it
2016-06-27 11:43:38	keveloper	idk what else to do
2016-06-27 11:43:38	na_th_an	do you regret

2016-06-27 13:07:17	keveloper	lol
2016-06-27 14:09:29	keveloper	the non alcoholic beer thing would have been stupid
2016-06-27 14:10:24	na_th_an	...what?
2016-06-27 14:10:42	na_th_an	where did that come from
2016-06-27 14:11:21	keveloper	wrong chat lol
2016-06-27 14:11:44	keveloper	talking about an alternate ex machina ending
2016-06-27 14:12:17	na_th_an	oh
2016-06-27 14:12:21	na_th_an	never seen it
2016-06-27 15:53:04	keveloper	welp
2016-06-27 15:54:23	na_th_an	welp, the person who needed to do that the most couldn't get their computer working
2016-06-27 15:54:26	na_th_an	other than that it went well
2016-06-27 15:56:22	keveloper	lolol
2016-06-28 10:36:48	keveloper	"seems like a healthy guy"
2016-06-28 10:57:29	keveloper	fuckin jeff
2016-06-28 10:57:33	keveloper	acting annoyed with me
2016-06-28 10:57:38	keveloper	because im "doing it wrong"
2016-06-28 10:57:55	na_th_an	I didn't hear any of that
2016-06-28 10:58:00	keveloper	i was like the firefly record count is wrong
2016-06-28 10:58:05	keveloper	there are more than it says
2016-06-28 10:58:09	keveloper	thats why it misses
2016-06-28 10:58:22	na_th_an	so what'd jeff say
2016-06-28 10:58:24	keveloper	and jeffs like don't care about the count, just keep hitting next record
2016-06-28 10:58:35	keveloper	which is apparently a thing?
2016-06-28 10:58:40	na_th_an	yeah try that
2016-06-28 10:58:43	na_th_an	that's what I'd do
2016-06-28 10:58:47	keveloper	either way, the next record thing is there when youre not passed the count
2016-06-28 10:58:48	keveloper	no
2016-06-28 10:58:50	keveloper	it doesn't work
2016-06-28 10:58:53	keveloper	because the count is wrong
2016-06-28 10:59:05	keveloper	firefly doesn't know there are more records unless you ask for them
2016-06-28 10:59:10	na_th_an	yeah
2016-06-28 10:59:11	keveloper	but you can start passed how many it thinks
2016-06-28 10:59:17	keveloper	so i can only get 499 more
2016-06-28 10:59:18	na_th_an	so keep asking for more records until it fails
2016-06-28 10:59:24	na_th_an	oh
2016-06-28 10:59:29	keveloper	you can only ask for 500 at a time
2016-06-28 10:59:30	na_th_an	so you can't actually get them all
2016-06-28 10:59:35	keveloper	yes
2016-06-28 10:59:37	na_th_an	did you mean
2016-06-28 10:59:48	na_th_an	"you can't start past how many it thinks"
2016-06-28 10:59:54	keveloper	yeah
2016-06-28 10:59:56	na_th_an	ok
2016-06-28 10:59:59	na_th_an	this makes sense now
2016-06-28 11:00:02	keveloper	if you do startRecord=max+1
2016-06-28 11:00:06	keveloper	its like "no records found"
2016-06-28 11:00:20	na_th_an	i see
2016-06-28 11:00:23	na_th_an	:(
2016-06-28 11:00:33	keveloper	how would i "click" that anyway
2016-06-28 11:00:41	keveloper	im doing like phatomjs or something
2016-06-28 11:00:49	na_th_an	you're using phantomjs?
2016-06-28 11:00:50	keveloper	i guess i could pull that url out of there and hit that i guess
2016-06-28 11:00:51	keveloper	no
2016-06-28 11:00:54	keveloper	im not*
2016-06-28 11:00:57	keveloper	using*
2016-06-28 11:00:58	keveloper	typing is hard
2016-06-28 11:01:11	keveloper	but either way that doesn't work because the next thing isn't there
2016-06-28 11:01:18	na_th_an	can you change the sort order somehow
2016-06-28 11:01:25	keveloper	probably
2016-06-28 11:01:29	na_th_an	so you get back records that you wouldn't otherwise
2016-06-28 11:01:30	keveloper	thats why we keep finding new ones
2016-06-28 11:01:37	keveloper	because they are newly modified
2016-06-28 11:01:42	keveloper	always get them back in the first 500
2016-06-28 11:01:50	na_th_an	yeah when this first came up after we fixed them "all" and more were broken
2016-06-28 11:01:57	na_th_an	I figured it was firefly not being able to index their own data correctly
2016-06-28 11:02:16	na_th_an	0/10 not surprised
2016-06-28 11:33:10	keveloper	ugh this question
2016-06-28 11:34:30	keveloper	i bet he's not pulling
2016-06-28 11:34:41	na_th_an	lol
2016-06-28 11:35:34	keveloper	i dont believe this guy
2016-06-28 11:35:41	na_th_an	I'm not paying attention
2016-06-28 11:35:47	na_th_an	I also don't know much about ubiquity
2016-06-28 11:35:54	na_th_an	I also want piada
2016-06-28 11:36:19	keveloper	i'm down
2016-06-28 11:36:24	keveloper	i am down as a doooowwwg
2016-06-28 11:36:27	keveloper	woof
2016-06-28 11:39:11	na_th_an	woof
2016-06-28 11:39:22	keveloper	lol
2016-06-28 11:39:22	keveloper	+1
2016-06-28 12:57:07	keveloper	it seems like jeff overcomplicates things sometimes
2016-06-28 12:58:29	keveloper	idk wtf im supposed to do with this list of ids
2016-06-28 13:00:14	na_th_an	yeah sometimes
2016-06-28 13:00:22	na_th_an	idk wtf you're supposed to do with it either
2016-06-28 13:33:24	na_th_an	ok so someone on the 4th floor had to shit really bad
2016-06-28 13:33:33	na_th_an	and got to the stall and and didn't quite make it
2016-06-28 13:33:40	na_th_an	and exploded onto the seat
2016-06-28 13:33:47	na_th_an	but then sat down on the shitty seat
2016-06-28 13:34:01	na_th_an	basically, if you need to poop, skip the 4th floor today
2016-06-28 13:36:55	keveloper	wait
2016-06-28 13:36:57	keveloper	ohhhhhhh
2016-06-28 13:36:59	keveloper	i thought you said
2016-06-28 13:37:06	keveloper	"but then i sat down on the shitty seat"
2016-06-28 13:37:10	na_th_an	lololol
2016-06-28 13:37:12	na_th_an	no I did not
2016-06-28 13:37:15	keveloper	i was like oh no
2016-06-28 13:37:29	na_th_an	look before you sit
2016-06-28 13:38:01	keveloper	always do
2016-06-28 13:39:46	keveloper	debugging this stupid script dammit
2016-06-28 13:40:56	keveloper	okay wwwwwwwtf
2016-06-28 13:49:29	keveloper	rashmi just talks to talk omg
2016-06-28 13:49:31	keveloper	i cant stand it
2016-06-28 13:49:40	na_th_an	i was wondering what was happening
2016-06-28 13:49:45	na_th_an	bc jinbin and jeff were both talking to her
2016-06-28 13:50:18	na_th_an	mark is asleep
2016-06-28 13:50:26	keveloper	she's always "like such as" blah blah blah
2016-06-28 13:50:41	keveloper	any time she says "like such as" im like okay the next 40 words wont matter
2016-06-28 13:52:15	keveloper	anyone wanna tell me why we dont change servers and keep the domains the same
2016-06-28 13:52:43	keveloper	do you have a legit reason for that
2016-06-28 13:55:07	na_th_an	there's a new naming scheme with bedrock
2016-06-28 13:55:19	na_th_an	because before names were based on the datacenter
2016-06-28 13:55:25	na_th_an	and datacenter == environment
2016-06-28 13:55:30	na_th_an	but now datacenter != environment
2016-06-28 13:55:47	na_th_an	because our NAT and Prod environment is going to span datacenters
2016-06-28 13:55:49	keveloper	ah
2016-06-28 14:22:34	keveloper	ugh
2016-06-28 14:22:38	keveloper	idk whats wrong with this script
2016-06-28 14:23:44	na_th_an	firefly
2016-06-28 14:52:41	keveloper	damn katie's so cute lol
2016-06-28 14:55:04	na_th_an	ya she is really cute
2016-06-28 14:57:51	keveloper	discuiap01dxm1.dev.oclc.org
2016-06-28 14:57:53	keveloper	new dev server
2016-06-28 14:57:58	keveloper	oops
2016-06-28 15:05:28	keveloper	na_th_an: back off bro
2016-06-28 15:11:40	na_th_an	huh
2016-06-28 15:14:31	keveloper	"do our servers have tmux or screen"
2016-06-28 15:14:36	keveloper	"nohup is the way you do it"
2016-06-28 15:14:40	keveloper	ugh whatever
2016-06-28 15:14:46	na_th_an	nuhup is generally more standard
2016-06-28 15:14:48	na_th_an	unfortunately
2016-06-28 15:15:14	na_th_an	tmux and screen are still cool people tools

2016-06-29 11:24:40	keveloper	?
2016-06-29 11:24:46	na_th_an	you can use double quotes as a string in bash
2016-06-29 11:24:50	keveloper	there are ' and "
2016-06-29 11:24:53	na_th_an	"this is a string"
2016-06-29 11:24:55	keveloper	in the ascii art
2016-06-29 11:24:58	na_th_an	idk what the diff between single and double is in bash
2016-06-29 11:25:01	keveloper	so they end the string

2016-06-29 14:15:50	na_th_an	or I seriously don't understand something
2016-06-29 14:26:41	na_th_an	one time I walked by andrew pace in the hallway and he was saying something like
2016-06-29 14:27:09	na_th_an	"someones gonna say something about how oclc's workforce isn't diverse and instead of actually being able to discuss the question skip is going to get all defensive and say we do"
2016-06-29 14:27:16	na_th_an	apparently skip is very defensive
2016-06-29 14:27:19	na_th_an	it shows in his ask skips
2016-06-29 14:27:35	na_th_an	and ya I'm pretty sure he is a dick
2016-06-29 14:27:43	keveloper	i think we have a decently diverse workforce
2016-06-29 14:27:48	keveloper	our team is pretty diverse at least
2016-06-29 14:27:59	keveloper	maybe that's generaly not true
2016-06-29 14:28:17	keveloper	65% is 46-58 year old white guy with mustaches so
2016-06-29 14:28:22	na_th_an	OCLC hires about 1/4 of the non-asian female CSE students at OSU

2016-06-29 14:28:55	na_th_an	and saw leah, sophie, claudia, and zach
2016-06-29 14:29:08	na_th_an	it was NOT representative of the OSU CSE student body at all
2016-06-29 14:29:32	na_th_an	I've had no more than 2 non-asian females in any of my classes

2016-06-30 10:47:32	na_th_an	idk what external search even is
2016-06-30 10:47:42	keveloper	do you think he got fired
2016-06-30 10:47:45	keveloper	or just randomly quit
2016-06-30 10:48:03	na_th_an	he probably quit
2016-06-30 10:48:18	na_th_an	he had a not so good divorce this year
2016-06-30 10:48:26	na_th_an	and it was just finalized
2016-06-30 10:48:33	na_th_an	so he's probably moving
2016-06-30 10:52:42	keveloper	ohh
2016-06-30 15:15:37	na_th_an	abby acting like she cares about QA

2016-06-30 15:16:28	na_th_an	I was in QA longer than she's been at oclc
2016-06-30 15:16:33	keveloper	me too lol
2016-06-30 15:16:41	keveloper	i was in qa longer than you
2016-06-30 15:16:51	na_th_an	I was in QA the whole time I was an intern
2016-06-30 15:16:51	keveloper	you went to middlewar
2016-06-30 15:16:54	na_th_an	technically
2016-06-30 15:17:26	na_th_an	I guess I probably wasn't technically QA when we were under Vic
2016-06-30 15:17:34	na_th_an	but when we got moved back under TJ I became QA again
2016-07-01 09:12:07	na_th_an	erik did get laid off I guess
2016-07-01 09:12:16	na_th_an	6 people did yestetrday

2016-07-01 09:13:07	na_th_an	no clue
2016-07-01 09:13:10	na_th_an	mike teets
2016-07-01 09:13:15	na_th_an	some people that worked in the phones
2016-07-01 09:13:21	na_th_an	idk nobody else I've ever heard of
2016-07-01 09:13:26	keveloper	mike teets got laid off wtf?
2016-07-01 09:13:31	na_th_an	apparently
2016-07-01 09:14:13	keveloper	is that in an email
2016-07-01 09:14:16	keveloper	where do you see that
2016-07-01 09:14:27	na_th_an	did you not see the email sent out yesterday about it
2016-07-01 09:14:33	keveloper	viewpoint?
2016-07-01 09:14:34	na_th_an	that mike teets was no longer at oclc
2016-07-01 09:14:38	na_th_an	no
2016-07-01 09:14:41	na_th_an	it was from jj
2016-07-01 09:14:44	na_th_an	about mike teets being gone
2016-07-01 09:14:50	keveloper	oh
2016-07-01 09:15:19	keveloper	" Mike Teets has decided it is time to make a change and will be leaving OCLC"
2016-07-01 09:15:47	keveloper	doesn't sound like laid off
2016-07-01 09:16:27	keveloper	So, today, when I caught myself muttering over “where the time went this year,” I immediately checked the mirror to see if I had somehow awakened decades older. Because that’s what it feels like to me when I say I’ve been at OCLC now for three years. Where did the time go?
2016-07-01 09:16:29	keveloper	wtf skip
2016-07-01 09:16:30	keveloper	lol
2016-07-01 09:17:20	na_th_an	yeah that was a bullshit viewpoint
2016-07-01 09:17:23	na_th_an	w/e
2016-07-01 09:17:26	na_th_an	I have a steering wheel in my bedroom
2016-07-01 09:17:32	keveloper	lol
2016-07-01 09:17:54	na_th_an	the force feedback was way cooler than I was expecting it to be
2016-07-01 09:19:04	keveloper	did anyone read that viewpoint like "wow inspirational" "such insight"
2016-07-01 09:19:18	na_th_an	yes
2016-07-01 09:19:21	na_th_an	I did

2016-07-06 10:26:56	na_th_an	but he wasn't working!
2016-07-06 10:27:05	na_th_an	honestly, if you're a full time student I don't think school is that hard
2016-07-06 10:27:18	keveloper	yeah it just takes up tons of time
2016-07-06 10:27:25	keveloper	and you have to be willing to dedicate your time
2016-07-06 10:27:28	na_th_an	if you're decent at managing your time you can get by with good grades and <40 hours a week of work easily
2016-07-06 10:27:33	keveloper	yeah
2016-07-06 10:27:41	na_th_an	if you actually work and don't fuck around

2016-07-06 10:28:05	na_th_an	he's probably one of the people that goes to the library and spends all day watching youtube and shit
2016-07-06 10:29:28	keveloper	"i was in the library all day studying"

2016-07-06 13:49:07	keveloper	instead of his like "i dunnnnnoooooooooo, im afraiiiiddd, what do YOU guys want to doooo" lol
2016-07-06 13:49:08	na_th_an	"work on X or leave"
2016-07-06 13:49:28	keveloper	i'm worried that X
2016-07-06 13:49:29	na_th_an	you won't get a bunch of devs to make something cool without any leadership or direction
2016-07-06 13:49:34	keveloper	ya
2016-07-06 13:49:41	keveloper	he needs to say fuck it and just do it
2016-07-06 13:49:44	keveloper	like our git thing
2016-07-06 13:49:48	keveloper	it was super awkward
2016-07-06 13:49:51	na_th_an	I *really* tried to get him to do that before
2016-07-06 13:49:54	keveloper	and it was half a joke before we did it
2016-07-06 13:49:58	na_th_an	and he did not seem interested at all in having a plan
2016-07-06 13:50:06	keveloper	and then we were just like whatever lets just do it
2016-07-06 13:50:14	keveloper	and it turned okay, and might not have helped very much
2016-07-06 13:50:18	keveloper	but we still 100% did it
2016-07-06 13:55:13	na_th_an	I think Ying got something out of that git thing
2016-07-06 13:55:26	na_th_an	and Jinbin kinda already knew what he was doing and I think it solidified some understanding
2016-07-06 13:55:34	na_th_an	I think it was probably a good use of time
2016-07-06 13:55:37	na_th_an	it didn't take much
2016-07-06 13:59:41	keveloper	chris evans on point again
2016-07-06 14:00:00	keveloper	just saw dads forehead

2016-07-06 14:17:09	keveloper	or maybe you
2016-07-06 14:17:20	na_th_an	sup
2016-07-06 14:17:21	keveloper	if you run the clear cache command on one host does it clear the cache for the entire app
2016-07-06 14:17:28	keveloper	(occ)
2016-07-06 14:17:38	na_th_an	umm
2016-07-06 14:17:44	keveloper	follow up: should the command only be run once?
2016-07-06 14:17:51	keveloper	when trying to flush the cache
2016-07-06 14:17:51	na_th_an	there was a thing jeff said about akamai recently and taht
2016-07-06 14:18:18	keveloper	i think when you add the word "local" to an occ command, it only runs it on that host
2016-07-06 14:18:22	na_th_an	yeah
2016-07-06 14:18:26	na_th_an	something like that
2016-07-06 14:18:26	keveloper	i *think*
2016-07-06 14:18:31	keveloper	i do not *know*
2016-07-06 14:18:34	na_th_an	and/or * means all hosts
2016-07-06 14:18:53	keveloper	"local execute command only on this host [OPTIONAL]"
2016-07-06 14:19:07	keveloper	local is bold there
2016-07-06 14:19:12	keveloper	but... ascii... so
2016-07-06 14:32:18	keveloper	chris evans for the winagin

2016-07-06 15:39:50	na_th_an	they are right by each other

2016-07-06 15:39:55	na_th_an	abby and stephen
2016-07-06 15:40:01	keveloper	did w not go
2016-07-06 15:40:12	na_th_an	I don't think so but idxk

2016-07-06 15:40:39	keveloper	talking about what to code
2016-07-06 15:40:50	na_th_an	probably
2016-07-06 15:40:55	keveloper	great
2016-07-06 15:43:15	keveloper	DUI CSDC install on friday \o/
2016-07-06 15:43:28	na_th_an	for ubiquity?

2016-07-06 15:49:49	keveloper	wait what
2016-07-06 15:49:53	keveloper	stephen was in standup
2016-07-06 15:49:57	keveloper	then where is abby lol
2016-07-06 15:50:37	na_th_an	abby left at 3:30 or whenever it starts
2016-07-06 15:50:53	na_th_an	just like, immediately came back and left
2016-07-06 15:50:56	na_th_an	bc excuse to do no work
2016-07-06 15:51:18	keveloper	wait immediately came back? from what
2016-07-06 15:51:22	keveloper	meeting?
2016-07-06 15:51:23	keveloper	then left?
2016-07-06 15:51:29	na_th_an	ya
2016-07-06 15:51:32	na_th_an	p sure
2016-07-06 15:51:36	keveloper	i wonder if rothlan is here
2016-07-06 15:51:46	keveloper	i dont see him
2016-07-06 15:52:08	na_th_an	those 2 probably went to go see thed ogs
2016-07-06 15:53:23	keveloper	lol
2016-07-06 15:53:34	keveloper	he should do a starter code thing
2016-07-06 15:53:42	keveloper	because getting started on something takes forever
2016-07-06 15:54:01	keveloper	but starter code can speed things up a lot
2016-07-06 15:54:06	na_th_an	yeah I suggested that to him
2016-07-06 15:54:08	keveloper	and get you into the important part faster
2016-07-06 15:54:14	na_th_an	that he should have a thing set up
2016-07-06 15:54:16	na_th_an	so we get started faster
2016-07-06 15:54:19	keveloper	spring boot project
2016-07-06 15:54:21	keveloper	hello world
2016-07-06 15:54:24	keveloper	then we have to make some restful thing
2016-07-06 15:54:26	keveloper	in pairs of 2
2016-07-06 15:54:30	keveloper	design and make it really quick
2016-07-06 15:54:30	na_th_an	but that violates the "I don't want to tell anyone what to do" tenant
2016-07-06 15:54:34	keveloper	true
2016-07-06 15:54:52	keveloper	and the exercise could be to use new models and libraries you normally don't use
2016-07-06 15:54:53	keveloper	like kotlin
2016-07-06 15:55:00	keveloper	or scala
2016-07-06 15:55:03	keveloper	or lombok
2016-07-06 15:55:07	keveloper	and h2
2016-07-06 15:55:10	keveloper	or sqlite
2016-07-06 15:55:15	na_th_an	too logical
2016-07-06 15:55:23	keveloper	-_-
2016-07-06 15:55:36	keveloper	i feel like we would be doing a good job at running it
2016-07-06 15:55:49	keveloper	because i don't care whether or not someone enjoyed it lol
2016-07-06 15:55:54	keveloper	as long as i enjoyed it lol
2016-07-06 15:56:09	na_th_an	I'd be sending out an agenda every tuesday morning like "This is what we're going to work on tomorrow afternoon. This is the agenda"
2016-07-06 15:56:25	keveloper	Here is the starter code if you want to take a look before you come
2016-07-06 15:56:45	na_th_an	"we will be using groovy, h2, and spring boot"
2016-07-06 15:56:47	na_th_an	boom
2016-07-06 15:56:54	na_th_an	people will be MUCH more likely to come
2016-07-06 15:57:06	na_th_an	"oh, this isn't going to be a waste of my time, cool"
2016-07-06 15:57:10	keveloper	the goal is to implement a RESTful API to do blah
2016-07-06 15:57:44	keveloper	and you will write an angular app to interact with the RESTful API via Ajax with JSON responses
2016-07-06 15:58:11	keveloper	it will interact with an H2 in memory database (not persistent)
2016-07-06 15:58:18	keveloper	beyond that everything is up to you
2016-07-06 15:58:21	keveloper	we will write for 60 minutes
2016-07-06 15:58:32	keveloper	then show each other how we implemented things/what libaries we used
2016-07-06 15:58:44	keveloper	talk about who's design we liked the best
2016-07-06 15:59:02	keveloper	also we will have cookies and popcorn
2016-07-06 15:59:08	keveloper	and drinks
2016-07-06 15:59:45	keveloper	woo i get to leave in 15
2016-07-06 16:00:02	keveloper	abby came in today and was like "woah youre here early"
2016-07-06 16:00:23	keveloper	and i was like "what? i've gotten here at 8 every day for the passed month except like 3 days"
2016-07-06 16:00:49	na_th_an	I wonder if she went home
2016-07-06 16:00:57	keveloper	lol
2016-07-06 16:01:01	keveloper	if she's on then no
2016-07-06 16:01:03	keveloper	is her laptop here tho
2016-07-06 16:01:18	na_th_an	ya her laptop is here
2016-07-06 16:01:34	keveloper	she's either fucking around in smith or gone
2016-07-06 16:08:54	keveloper	how do you change number of tasks on a page in a change request
2016-07-06 16:10:47	keveloper	halp
2016-07-06 16:14:02	na_th_an	I'm trying to find the person I emailed
2016-07-06 16:14:20	keveloper	can you just go to your sent and forward it to me
2016-07-06 16:14:49	na_th_an	well I had to find the email first

2016-07-07 13:36:43	na_th_an	although
2016-07-07 13:36:52	na_th_an	that would mean he was thinking about how late he got here
2016-07-07 13:36:55	na_th_an	and felt anxious about it
2016-07-07 13:37:01	na_th_an	and I don't think taht's ever happened to him

2016-07-08 08:42:12	na_th_an	I just can't even
2016-07-08 08:42:19	keveloper	maybe he's drinking some orange drink and not mountain dew because his relatived died of a heart attack and now he wants to stop drinking pop

2016-07-08 08:42:34	na_th_an	he drinks orange juice too sometimes
2016-07-08 08:42:40	na_th_an	which is probably worse than diet mountain dew
2016-07-08 08:42:56	keveloper	he's using binoculars to look at your screen

2016-07-08 09:16:22	na_th_an	because odds are in one data center and events are in another

2016-07-11 08:33:06	keveloper	i fixed one of the health checks
2016-07-11 08:33:08	keveloper	its very weird
2016-07-11 08:33:17	keveloper	the CI cache service was down which was why they were failling
2016-07-11 08:33:30	keveloper	except only one of the health checks was good after i started the cache service again
2016-07-11 08:33:43	na_th_an	maybe needed to bounce the other one
2016-07-11 08:33:53	keveloper	its prodcon owned
2016-07-11 08:34:07	na_th_an	yeah
2016-07-11 08:34:12	na_th_an	so you email them and be like
2016-07-11 08:34:40	na_th_an	"Yo prodcon, I did this and it fixed one of the health checks, can you try bouncing the other one to see if it clears the health check?"
2016-07-11 08:35:07	keveloper	prodcon@oclc?
2016-07-11 08:35:09	na_th_an	assuming it's safe to bounce
2016-07-11 08:35:19	na_th_an	I mean don't do it right now without talking to ppl since a tech lead is here
2016-07-11 08:35:31	na_th_an	but like, just fyi that's a thing you can do
2016-07-11 08:35:49	keveloper	ent act prime losing cache is like the least important thing ever so

2016-07-11 08:37:16	keveloper	it's supposed to have access to CI data or something

2016-07-12 08:45:20	keveloper	so
2016-07-12 08:45:26	keveloper	i've been thinking this morning
2016-07-12 08:45:31	keveloper	your gonna be like "lol smh"
2016-07-12 08:45:38	keveloper	i have a goal
2016-07-12 08:45:43	keveloper	at age 26
2016-07-12 08:45:45	na_th_an	k
2016-07-12 08:45:50	keveloper	to buy an audi a7
2016-07-12 08:45:55	keveloper	so
2016-07-12 08:45:58	na_th_an	so in 4 years?
2016-07-12 08:46:13	keveloper	4 years 10 months ish yeah
2016-07-12 08:46:14	keveloper	so
2016-07-12 08:46:25	keveloper	i figured out this morning that i can save $1k every month
2016-07-12 08:46:37	keveloper	and still have $1070 left for monthly spending
2016-07-12 08:47:03	keveloper	so every pay check for the next 4 years, I am going to move over exactly $1k to my savings, very strict, every time
2016-07-12 08:47:29	keveloper	and whatever I have left at the end of that month in spending, i will move half of that to savings
2016-07-12 08:47:32	na_th_an	have you counted interest
2016-07-12 08:47:35	keveloper	no
2016-07-12 08:47:37	na_th_an	and selling your old car
2016-07-12 08:47:39	keveloper	no
2016-07-12 08:47:41	keveloper	well yeah
2016-07-12 08:47:41	keveloper	so
2016-07-12 08:48:00	keveloper	my estimated worth of my car in 5 years from now is like $9k-$12k
2016-07-12 08:48:12	keveloper	and if I do this $1k savings thing every month
2016-07-12 08:48:21	keveloper	(I really hope I have the self control to do this)
2016-07-12 08:48:52	keveloper	That's $58,000 ish by the time i want to buy an a7
2016-07-12 08:48:58	keveloper	which obviously I won't spend all on an A7
2016-07-12 08:49:02	keveloper	(not buying new, duh)
2016-07-12 08:49:08	na_th_an	I mean if that's what you wanna do then go for it
2016-07-12 08:49:18	na_th_an	it's your $$$
2016-07-12 08:49:24	keveloper	so basically, 3 year used A7s are about $38-48k
2016-07-12 08:49:38	keveloper	so if I plan to buy a $44k A7
2016-07-12 08:49:57	keveloper	Then I can put my $10k from my car + $14k from savings into it (or more)
2016-07-12 08:50:17	keveloper	and have 44-24 = 20 and do a 5 year 20k loan for the same payment im doing now
2016-07-12 08:50:30	keveloper	(on a significantly higher salary by the time I'm 26)
2016-07-12 08:50:42	keveloper	I think I can do this :D
2016-07-12 08:50:51	keveloper	Also I want to look for a secondary income that is low stress
2016-07-12 08:51:00	keveloper	I've wanted this car since I was like 17 lol
2016-07-12 08:51:07	na_th_an	cameron that is not what "running as root" means
2016-07-12 08:51:20	keveloper	I don't think he's very good
2016-07-12 08:51:26	na_th_an	apparently not
2016-07-12 08:51:30	na_th_an	cool dude tho
2016-07-12 08:51:34	na_th_an	he's more into data shit
2016-07-12 08:51:39	na_th_an	he has a math major
2016-07-12 08:51:48	na_th_an	I think he's pretty smart just not at this obv
2016-07-12 08:51:53	keveloper	wait
2016-07-12 08:51:54	keveloper	yes it is
2016-07-12 08:52:07	keveloper	If they don't have LHR-Webapp in their code
2016-07-12 08:52:14	keveloper	then the app is deployed at /LHR-Webapp/
2016-07-12 08:52:18	keveloper	which means its not running at root
2016-07-12 08:52:29	keveloper	unless i read it wrong
2016-07-12 08:52:31	keveloper	but this though
2016-07-12 08:52:32	keveloper	"Is there a way to run a single web app as root using the Ubiquty install process?"
2016-07-12 08:52:38	na_th_an	he said AS root
2016-07-12 08:52:40	keveloper	come on cameron there obvious has to be a way
2016-07-12 08:52:48	na_th_an	"running webapp as root" reads the root user
2016-07-12 08:53:01	keveloper	I figured he meant running the app AT root
2016-07-12 08:53:14	na_th_an	reading the email it's obvious that's what he means
2016-07-12 08:53:20	keveloper	i have no idea how he managed to do that
2016-07-12 08:53:26	na_th_an	but he said as root multiple times
2016-07-12 08:53:31	na_th_an	it's a tomcat thing
2016-07-12 08:53:31	keveloper	ok i see you
2016-07-12 08:53:34	keveloper	ya lol
2016-07-12 08:54:05	keveloper	Do you think I can save $1k a month for 5 years
2016-07-12 08:54:12	na_th_an	I think it's possible
2016-07-12 08:54:12	keveloper	give me feedback on my plan
2016-07-12 08:54:14	na_th_an	idk about your life
2016-07-12 08:54:16	keveloper	lol
2016-07-12 08:54:21	keveloper	Well I did all the math and I can do it
2016-07-12 08:54:27	keveloper	I think $1070 a month is enough for expensive
2016-07-12 08:54:31	keveloper	(it better fucking be dammit kevin)
2016-07-12 08:54:34	na_th_an	I know I wouldn't be able to but that's because I don't want an audi a7
2016-07-12 08:54:55	keveloper	i'm curious about what you spend money on then lol
2016-07-12 08:55:00	keveloper	i guess a bunch of computer stuff
2016-07-12 08:55:12	keveloper	So I have like $1400 in bills a month basically
2016-07-12 08:55:12	na_th_an	food, computer shit, amazon shit
2016-07-12 08:55:23	na_th_an	I have like $1000 or so I think
2016-07-12 08:55:23	keveloper	thats leave $2100
2016-07-12 08:55:48	na_th_an	that doesn't seem right
2016-07-12 08:55:52	keveloper	what?
2016-07-12 08:55:56	na_th_an	$100
2016-07-12 08:55:58	na_th_an	$1000
2016-07-12 08:56:00	na_th_an	actually
2016-07-12 08:56:06	keveloper	what? lol
2016-07-12 08:56:36	na_th_an	I think $1000 is way high
2016-07-12 08:56:44	na_th_an	not way high
2016-07-12 08:57:00	na_th_an	okay I think $1000 is about right
2016-07-12 08:57:04	keveloper	lolol

2016-07-12 08:57:12	na_th_an	if I include my jetbrains and google music
2016-07-12 08:57:16	na_th_an	and shit
2016-07-12 08:57:25	na_th_an	and amazon
2016-07-12 08:57:28	keveloper	oh come on gerrit you knew what he meant
2016-07-12 08:57:33	keveloper	na_th_an: oh i forgot about google music
2016-07-12 08:57:38	keveloper	(oh no!)
2016-07-12 08:57:41	keveloper	i think my plan is broken now
2016-07-12 08:58:22	na_th_an	gerrit probably didn't read it
2016-07-12 08:58:34	keveloper	oops wrong chat

2016-07-12 08:58:53	na_th_an	idk man I'm sure it's possible
2016-07-12 08:59:06	na_th_an	it's not that hard to save money if you're frugal
2016-07-12 08:59:10	na_th_an	it's easy no to tho
2016-07-12 08:59:17	keveloper	but i guess a single guy (marriage wise) with no kids at 22 making $60k a year should be able to save $12000 a year
2016-07-12 08:59:25	na_th_an	I did some android shit yesterday

2016-07-12 09:08:41	na_th_an	it's gonna be free and open source
2016-07-12 09:08:42	keveloper	I might do apps as a secondary income

2016-07-12 09:09:08	na_th_an	I might try to make it so that you have to pay to use my central server if you want
2016-07-12 09:09:11	na_th_an	or you can run your own
2016-07-12 09:09:18	keveloper	ooh ya
2016-07-12 09:09:23	na_th_an	everything will be end to end encrypted

2016-07-12 09:09:39	na_th_an	huh
2016-07-12 09:09:43	keveloper	like who would understand that sentence and be like "okay here's my money"
2016-07-12 09:09:55	na_th_an	that's a marketing thing
2016-07-12 09:10:01	keveloper	true
2016-07-12 09:10:05	keveloper	call up jay
2016-07-12 09:10:07	na_th_an	99% of people would just buy the version of the app that would come with it
2016-07-12 09:10:19	na_th_an	the 1% that realize it's open source would look up instructions torun their own
2016-07-12 09:10:32	na_th_an	and also
2016-07-12 09:10:42	na_th_an	idgaf because I'd only do that to cover expenses if they got too high

2016-07-12 09:11:42	na_th_an	notifications after messageing is really good
2016-07-12 09:12:01	keveloper	see you need a product person who understands your market to give you features that are worth money

2016-07-12 14:33:40	na_th_an	all I've ever seen him do is go to meetings and be like "ya gotta test"

2016-07-12 14:48:14	na_th_an	I didn't look closely
2016-07-12 14:48:48	keveloper	i wonder why eric stopped coming to irc
2016-07-12 14:49:00	na_th_an	probably because we were tired of his shit
2016-07-12 14:49:06	na_th_an	or because he's getting here at 11 and doesn't want us to know
2016-07-12 14:49:09	na_th_an	but that would imply shame
2016-07-12 14:49:13	na_th_an	so I don't think that's the case
2016-07-12 14:49:18	na_th_an	he doesn't like that we didn't like his song

2016-07-13 10:19:59	keveloper	it was fun having to hack together xpaths to find certain elements and build page objects
2016-07-13 10:20:35	keveloper	yesterday when jeff was like
2016-07-13 10:20:45	keveloper	"i will never check jira"
2016-07-13 10:20:49	keveloper	emails
2016-07-13 10:20:58	keveloper	"i only delete jira emails"
2016-07-13 10:21:04	keveloper	as an argument against something
2016-07-13 10:21:05	keveloper	i was like
2016-07-13 10:21:11	keveloper	"that sounds like a you problem"
2016-07-13 10:21:15	na_th_an	he's not wrong
2016-07-13 10:21:23	na_th_an	jira emails and alerts are useless
2016-07-13 10:21:23	keveloper	i look at jira emails everyday
2016-07-13 10:21:35	keveloper	i just zoom through it really quickly
2016-07-13 10:21:41	keveloper	yeah except the robert torre-martin stuff?
2016-07-13 10:21:51	keveloper	that was pretty important and he found out through emails
2016-07-13 10:22:15	na_th_an	jira is a poor tool for sending a message to someone
2016-07-13 10:22:19	na_th_an	would you agree with that?
2016-07-13 10:22:43	na_th_an	and so, we probably shouldn't base a part of our process around using jira to send messages to people?
2016-07-13 10:22:59	na_th_an	there are better, more efficient ways to accomplish that
2016-07-13 10:23:17	keveloper	yeah lol
2016-07-13 10:23:32	keveloper	i wish we had a good way to get a notification about a jria comment like facebook
2016-07-13 10:23:34	keveloper	that wasn't email
2016-07-13 10:23:59	keveloper	like if im sitting in jira and someone comments on something im watching it better be like "x commented on y"
2016-07-13 10:24:04	keveloper	and why dont i have like a feed
2016-07-13 10:24:23	keveloper	like my homepage should be like "bridget dauer commented on an issue you are watching"
2016-07-13 10:24:27	keveloper	thatd be very helpful
2016-07-13 10:27:46	keveloper	got it
2016-07-13 10:27:49	keveloper	im making my own dashboard
2016-07-13 10:38:44	keveloper	woo got my activity stream
2016-07-13 10:38:53	keveloper	this is nice
2016-07-13 11:13:58	na_th_an	I was thinking
2016-07-13 11:14:02	na_th_an	that he probably has sleep apnea
2016-07-13 11:14:03	keveloper	 day 2 of 1825

2016-07-13 11:14:46	keveloper	o
2016-07-13 11:15:44	keveloper	i'd rather say 5 years than 1825 days
2016-07-13 11:18:39	keveloper	5 years ago i was going into my junior year of highschool
2016-07-13 11:18:44	keveloper	that is so weird

2016-07-13 13:03:02	na_th_an	there's no actual information there
2016-07-13 13:04:38	na_th_an	it's just a list of questions
2016-07-13 15:39:37	keveloper	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer#Attack_Decay_Sustain_Release_.28ADSR.29_envelope
2016-07-14 09:01:45	na_th_an	listening to mark eat is my favorite part of every morning
2016-07-14 09:01:51	keveloper	lol
2016-07-14 09:02:57	na_th_an	I think abby might be overreacting to what happened
2016-07-14 09:03:01	na_th_an	highway lanes are pretty big
2016-07-14 09:03:03	na_th_an	w/e tho

2016-07-14 09:05:02	na_th_an	and what keys it looks up
2016-07-14 09:05:14	na_th_an	and what key it looks up to return the current db
2016-07-14 09:05:36	keveloper	oh i see u
2016-07-14 09:05:38	keveloper	okay
2016-07-14 09:05:41	keveloper	idk why i was confused
2016-07-14 09:05:47	na_th_an	it's pretty weird code
2016-07-14 09:05:53	na_th_an	another xifeng present
2016-07-14 09:05:57	na_th_an	it's ugly and dumb
2016-07-14 09:06:06	na_th_an	and has stupid hacks for dumb shit
2016-07-14 09:06:12	na_th_an	like db long names
2016-07-14 09:06:41	keveloper	dbinfo.xwc.z-pnz.displayLongName
2016-07-14 09:07:08	na_th_an	that won't display in the "Other Databases" FRBR section
2016-07-14 09:07:10	na_th_an	I think
2016-07-14 09:07:13	na_th_an	IIRC
2016-07-14 09:07:26	na_th_an	that's another place you have to make sure the database name appears correctly
2016-07-14 09:07:49	keveloper	ugh
2016-07-14 09:07:59	na_th_an	bc we never implemented copyright statements right
2016-07-14 09:08:01	keveloper	there's a bunch of stuff defined that way
2016-07-14 09:08:13	na_th_an	yeah it should only be copyright statements I think
2016-07-14 09:08:15	na_th_an	I could be wrong
2016-07-14 09:08:17	na_th_an	or it could be wrong
2016-07-14 09:08:19	na_th_an	it's all stupid code
2016-07-14 09:08:42	keveloper	why doens't it just have the same display as the facet section like
2016-07-14 09:09:05	na_th_an	because like for Medline
2016-07-14 09:09:18	na_th_an	when you look at the record at the top it says a full copyright statement
2016-07-14 09:09:30	keveloper	o
2016-07-14 09:09:33	na_th_an	but then in the Other Databases: section if it's part of a FRBR workset it just says "Medline"
2016-07-14 09:09:43	keveloper	idk if thats the way i would have done that lol
2016-07-14 09:09:54	na_th_an	it fucking shouldn't be
2016-07-14 09:09:56	na_th_an	it's gross and awful
2016-07-14 09:09:58	keveloper	lol
2016-07-14 09:10:12	na_th_an	xifeng did disgusting things with properties files that should be illegal
2016-07-14 09:10:19	keveloper	lol

2016-07-14 09:11:02	keveloper	do you know anything about investing
2016-07-14 09:11:19	na_th_an	no
2016-07-14 09:11:20	keveloper	like when i save up $10k should I put 2 or 3k in a mutual bond or something
2016-07-14 09:11:24	na_th_an	there are some good khan academy videos
2016-07-14 09:11:28	keveloper	mutual bonds are small gains but not risky i think
2016-07-14 09:11:33	na_th_an	I know not shit about investing
2016-07-14 09:11:35	keveloper	okay lol

2016-07-14 09:11:49	keveloper	yeah lol
2016-07-14 09:11:51	keveloper	maybe idk
2016-07-14 09:12:00	na_th_an	mutual funds are managed stock portfolios
2016-07-14 09:12:15	keveloper	mutual fund is like a bunch of people pool invest in a bunch of companies and split the earnings right
2016-07-14 09:12:22	keveloper	thats why its "mutual"
2016-07-14 09:12:41	na_th_an	well you all mutually invest in a fund that is managed by an investment firm
2016-07-14 09:12:50	na_th_an	there are different kinds, like some are generalized
2016-07-14 09:12:57	na_th_an	some focus in certain industries
2016-07-14 09:13:06	na_th_an	but the firm buys/sells/trades stocks within the fund
2016-07-14 09:13:10	na_th_an	for maximum returns
2016-07-14 09:13:12	keveloper	k properties file thing worked
2016-07-14 09:13:24	na_th_an	"it doesn't work"

2016-07-14 09:13:50	na_th_an	but ya I've heard a lot of people talk about tracking a market index instead of mutual funds
2016-07-14 09:13:54	na_th_an	like the S&P
2016-07-14 09:14:01	na_th_an	/r/personalfinance is really good
2016-07-14 09:14:07	keveloper	dude oclc is a great company

2016-07-14 09:14:31	keveloper	like seriously

2016-07-14 16:19:21	na_th_an	having some debt can be healthy
2016-07-14 16:19:27	na_th_an	leasing is dumb
2016-07-14 16:19:44	keveloper	it was the cheapest way for her to get a reliable car for 3 years in college
2016-07-14 16:19:46	keveloper	it made sense
2016-07-14 16:19:46	na_th_an	I worked with a girl who leased a brand new car while she was in high school

2016-07-14 16:20:09	keveloper	in her use case it made sense I think
2016-07-14 16:20:11	na_th_an	I'd rather spend as little as possible on a beater and get it repaired than lease a car for college
2016-07-14 16:20:18	na_th_an	but OSU is a little different than capital probably
2016-07-14 16:20:21	keveloper	her dad won't buy used cars ever
