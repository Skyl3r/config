2017-10-04 17:01:38	z8z	Are you more specialised in design or coding?
2017-10-04 17:06:00	keveloper	I have a degree in computer science and most of my experience is in full stack java development so I'd say coding first
2017-10-04 17:06:19	keveloper	But I've been doing front end design for probably 2 years now and have been freelancing for it for a year or so
