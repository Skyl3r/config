2017-04-19 09:38:40	keveloper	lol
2017-04-19 09:39:00	abbyaha	what tip do you recommend for a newbie
2017-04-19 09:39:00	keveloper	they all had either 1 file and or like 6 approvals
2017-04-19 09:39:38	keveloper	abbyaha: plastic
2017-04-19 09:40:09	keveloper	probably a PE
2017-04-19 09:40:18	keveloper	"polyethylene"
2017-04-19 09:41:10	keveloper	i'd just go with a prebuilt one and probably a 2 series launcher and you'll be set to at least see if you like the sport
2017-04-19 09:41:50	na_th_an	yeah you get a better deal with a prebuild originally than a custom
2017-04-19 09:42:25	abbyaha	sounds fair sounds good, how much money can i expect to drop on this?
2017-04-19 09:43:08	keveloper	probably like $20
2017-04-19 09:43:12	keveloper	starter ones are cheap
2017-04-19 09:43:17	na_th_an	the worst starter kits are like $20 but then you need a battle arena if you don't want to have to use someone else's
2017-04-19 09:43:17	abbyaha	okay cool
2017-04-19 09:43:34	abbyaha	hmmmm can i use one of yours?
2017-04-19 09:43:36	keveloper	don't get those shitty thin plastic battle arenas though they bend and stuff
2017-04-19 09:43:44	keveloper	also your bey will bounce
2017-04-19 09:43:44	na_th_an	also you probably want to get some better rip cords
2017-04-19 09:43:49	na_th_an	you get blisters p quick if you don't
2017-04-19 09:44:06	abbyaha	hmmm are they any gloves i can wear?
2017-04-19 09:44:07	na_th_an	if you don't buy your own you can only battle with people tha thave one
2017-04-19 09:44:14	na_th_an	and they'll have home court advantage
2017-04-19 09:44:15	abbyaha	do i need goggles?
2017-04-19 09:44:21	na_th_an	on

2017-04-19 10:06:36	keveloper	abbyaha: but it's not very good at attack
2017-04-19 10:06:41	keveloper	its good for stamina
2017-04-19 10:06:52	keveloper	normally you'll have a stamina and attack bey
2017-04-19 10:06:54	na_th_an	stamina aint shit when you're being pushed around the arena

2017-04-19 10:08:04	na_th_an	different tip
2017-04-19 10:08:11	na_th_an	and the rip gear is titanium instead of plastic
2017-04-19 10:09:05	keveloper	abbyaha: oh also heavier launchers are easier to use because you are less likely to jerk it while ripping
2017-04-19 10:09:25	keveloper	a lot of begining have trouble launching into the arena
2017-04-19 10:09:29	keveloper	beginners*
2017-04-19 10:19:01	zekkin	i definitely have trouble getting mine into the arena
2017-04-19 10:20:51	keveloper	does your launcher have a handle
2017-04-19 10:20:57	keveloper	the cheap ones dont
2017-04-19 10:21:02	keveloper	hard to hold
2017-04-19 10:21:48	keveloper	zekkin: i'd get like the zero-g or something
2017-04-19 10:28:09	zekkin	i need a custom grip
2017-04-19 10:28:49	na_th_an	there are some good parts you can 3d print
2017-04-19 10:30:06	keveloper	na_th_an: do you use a string rip cord
2017-04-19 10:30:15	na_th_an	no i do metal on metal
2017-04-19 10:30:18	keveloper	jeez

2017-04-19 10:30:23	keveloper	y u so intense

2017-04-19 10:30:38	na_th_an	they get dull so I have backups
2017-04-19 10:30:48	na_th_an	dat metal on metal feel
2017-04-19 10:30:49	keveloper	so you have to rip it exactly perpendicular
2017-04-19 10:30:51	na_th_an	plastic feels mushy
2017-04-19 10:30:54	keveloper	or does it bend

2017-04-19 14:42:36	keveloper	xveamvx: https://goo.gl/photos/ebk1iAwgB2qzYVu18
2017-04-19 14:42:52	keveloper	i thought i had more pics but thats part of it
2017-04-19 14:42:58	tr4656_	Yeah
2017-04-19 14:43:01	tr4656_	Java really sucks
2017-04-19 14:43:09	keveloper	tr4656_: java 8 isn't that bad
2017-04-19 14:43:15	keveloper	tr4656_: but the language is meh, the jvm is bae
2017-04-19 14:43:16	na_th_an	why
2017-04-19 14:43:24	zekkin	System.out.println("BEYBLADES RULE");
2017-04-19 14:43:48	keveloper	xveamvx: https://goo.gl/photos/ZZqnYxZWrfEt5UvdA
2017-04-19 14:43:51	tr4656_	jvm has never been the problem
2017-04-19 14:44:06	xveamvx	vv noice
2017-04-19 14:46:16	na_th_an	why does java suck tho
2017-04-19 14:47:53	keveloper	u askin tr4656_ or just in general
2017-04-19 14:48:00	keveloper	cause i think you well know why java scusk
2017-04-19 14:48:26	na_th_an	most people online are quick to say "java sucks" but then don't have a lot of reasons why
2017-04-19 14:48:38	na_th_an	beyond things like "osgi is really complicated" and "java ee is a ridiculous spec"
2017-04-19 14:48:39	keveloper	because its cool to hate java
2017-04-19 14:48:41	na_th_an	which are true
2017-04-19 14:48:46	na_th_an	java has a lot of pain points
2017-04-19 14:48:49	keveloper	pojos
2017-04-19 14:48:52	keveloper	getters setters
2017-04-19 14:48:53	na_th_an	but with modern tools
2017-04-19 14:48:54	keveloper	ridiculous verbosity
2017-04-19 14:49:00	na_th_an	a lot of it isn't really an issue
2017-04-19 14:49:02	keveloper	lack of functional language features
2017-04-19 14:49:04	na_th_an	or at least not nearly as much as it used to be
2017-04-19 14:49:14	keveloper	yeah its fine now java 8 is p good
2017-04-19 14:49:16	na_th_an	java 8 added a decent amount of functional programming features
2017-04-19 14:49:17	keveloper	but groovy >>>>>
2017-04-19 14:49:20	keveloper	i kno
2017-04-19 14:49:24	keveloper	u don gotta tell me
2017-04-19 14:49:29	na_th_an	but so I ask people why because I want to know
2017-04-19 14:49:35	na_th_an	I want to know what java lacks that other languages have
2017-04-19 14:49:54	na_th_an	I want to know what other people have trouble with so I can look out for it
2017-04-19 14:50:01	keveloper	ES5 best language
2017-04-19 14:50:20	tr4656_	I'm currently mainly writing Ruby and C++
2017-04-19 14:50:25	na_th_an	so I ask people why java sucks whenever they jump in and say "java sucks" online to see if it's a bandwagon "java sucks" or an actual reason
2017-04-19 14:50:43	keveloper	tr4656_: for what? web dev or?
2017-04-19 14:50:48	tr4656_	lol ES5
2017-04-19 14:50:54	keveloper	tr4656_: i am meme
2017-04-19 14:50:55	na_th_an	I think a lot of the "java sucks" comes from "corporate development sucks and they use a lot of java"
2017-04-19 14:51:06	keveloper	ay some of our business logic is cool
2017-04-19 14:51:09	tr4656_	Yeah, web dev, ruby mainly

2017-04-19 14:55:06	tr4656_	idk, isn't that the only use for websockets
2017-04-19 14:55:30	tr4656_	Something that needs to happen real time with many users
2017-04-19 14:55:46	keveloper	well some people use it as a replacement for xhr
2017-04-19 14:55:48	keveloper	(wrongly)
2017-04-19 14:56:07	na_th_an	some people push ads through websockets to get around ad blockers
2017-04-19 14:56:19	keveloper	shit m8
2017-04-19 14:56:25	keveloper	thats smart
2017-04-19 14:57:22	tr4656_	That seems like a lot of effort to bypass ad blockers
2017-04-19 14:57:41	keveloper	$$$

2017-04-20 12:35:36	xveamvx	I was really confused at first
2017-04-20 12:35:42	xveamvx	then I just understood it lol
2017-04-20 12:35:49	+keveloper	glad we could fix the compiler errors

2017-04-20 12:36:28	xveamvx	I told my professor about it and he emailed everyone in the class on how to fix it
2017-04-20 12:36:36	+keveloper	oh dope

2017-04-20 12:36:41	+keveloper	nah jk
2017-04-20 12:36:45	xveamvx	only one group had shown him so far
2017-04-20 12:36:52	xveamvx	and there's didnt work very well
2017-04-20 12:36:57	xveamvx	I get to keep the pi too
2017-04-20 12:37:01	+keveloper	\o/
2017-04-20 12:37:01	xveamvx	which is lit af
2017-04-20 12:37:16	xveamvx	I needed a new HTPC
2017-04-20 12:37:20	+keveloper	🔥
2017-04-20 12:37:41	xveamvx	disassembled my actual htpc so I could use the parts to build my friend a pc
2017-04-20 12:38:05	+SlabDabs	nice xveamvx
2017-04-20 12:41:47	+slaytaner	rip xveamvx
2017-04-20 12:41:55	xveamvx	thx
2017-04-20 12:47:25	+na_th_an	xveamvx: libreelec?
2017-04-20 12:47:33	xveamvx	wut
2017-04-20 12:47:35	+na_th_an	dat shit's da bomb
2017-04-20 12:47:38	+na_th_an	for your pi htpc
2017-04-20 12:47:39	xveamvx	is that an os?
2017-04-20 12:47:43	+na_th_an	yeah
2017-04-20 12:47:48	xveamvx	idk
2017-04-20 12:47:56	xveamvx	I reall have only ever used Raspbian
2017-04-20 12:48:01	xveamvx	and xbmc once
2017-04-20 12:48:27	+na_th_an	well xbmc is kodi now
2017-04-20 12:48:39	+na_th_an	if all you want with your pi is an htpc you should check out openelec
2017-04-20 12:48:43	+na_th_an	err, libreelec*
2017-04-20 12:48:46	xveamvx	dank
2017-04-20 12:48:48	xveamvx	will do
2017-04-20 12:48:51	+slaytaner	pi 4 needs a gigabit network interface
2017-04-20 12:49:06	xveamvx	I can use ethernet
2017-04-20 12:49:14	+na_th_an	gigabit won't mean shit if the bus is still shared with usb
2017-04-20 12:49:18	+slaytaner	it's only 100mbps
2017-04-20 12:49:21	+na_th_an	the pi can't even hit 100mbps right now
2017-04-20 12:49:27	+slaytaner	I mean that's what I'm sayin
2017-04-20 12:49:38	+na_th_an	it maxes out at like 66mbps I think
2017-04-20 12:49:42	+na_th_an	(which is fine for an HTPC)
2017-04-20 12:49:44	+slaytaner	next one needs true gigabit
2017-04-20 12:50:14	+na_th_an	I just want an ARM board that can run linux with gigabit ethernet and like 10 SATA slots
2017-04-20 12:50:20	+na_th_an	so I can have an arm-based NAS
2017-04-20 12:50:39	+slaytaner	system76 has one
2017-04-20 12:51:11	+na_th_an	if you can link me to something like that i'd be pretty happy
2017-04-20 12:51:12	+na_th_an	I've looked
2017-04-20 12:51:14	<--	abbyaha (~haseleya@132.174.100.202) has quit (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
2017-04-20 12:51:15	+na_th_an	and asked around
2017-04-20 12:51:17	+keveloper	does anybody in here like architecture and minecraft
2017-04-20 12:51:30	+keveloper	i want builders for my creative/modern city server
2017-04-20 12:51:34	+slaytaner	I mean it's the whole shebang
2017-04-20 12:51:39	+slaytaner	an arm server
2017-04-20 12:52:04	+keveloper	slaytaner: you mean its the whole #!
2017-04-20 12:53:05	+slaytaner	yeah and you'd need a backplane
2017-04-20 12:53:21	-->	abbyaha (~haseleya@132.174.100.202) has joined #beyblades
2017-04-20 12:53:26	+slaytaner	anyway arm servers seem to be best for parallel processing
2017-04-20 12:53:29	+na_th_an	I don't know much about "real" servers
2017-04-20 12:53:34	+keveloper	na_th_an: hey whats the entropy service you said i should enable
2017-04-20 12:53:46	+na_th_an	keveloper: haveged or something like that
2017-04-20 12:53:53	+na_th_an	ya haveged
2017-04-20 12:54:10	+slaytaner	get a giger counter
2017-04-20 12:55:02	+slaytaner	you can also use an sdr to get some more randomish entropy
2017-04-20 12:55:49	+na_th_an	he doesn't need actual entropy
2017-04-20 12:56:02	+na_th_an	he just wasn't able to generate a gpg key yesterday because there wasn't any entropy on the server
2017-04-20 12:56:12	+keveloper	ya
2017-04-20 12:58:05	+slaytaner	rip
2017-04-20 12:58:17	+keveloper	k so nobody like architecture and minecraft in here i guess

2017-04-20 13:50:52	+keveloper	Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is
2017-04-20 13:50:52	+keveloper	a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

2017-04-20 15:14:04	+abbyaha	i have to take notes for matt
2017-04-20 15:14:09	+abbyaha	yay micromanaging
2017-04-20 15:24:10	+tr4656_	The unicorn frap is horrible
2017-04-20 15:24:15	+tr4656_	I bought it yesterday
2017-04-20 15:24:20	+abbyaha	should i not
2017-04-20 15:24:40	+tr4656_	Go and try it but I think it's way overhyped and doens't have a great taste
2017-04-20 15:24:51	+bubbrubb	tr4656_: what is it supposed to taste like
2017-04-20 15:25:00	+tr4656_	I did just order another one because postmates lets you get one for free
2017-04-20 15:25:10	+abbyaha	oooooooo
2017-04-20 15:25:11	+tr4656_	but the main factor there was free
2017-04-20 15:25:13	+abbyaha	yay postmates
2017-04-20 15:25:15	+abbyaha	ya
2017-04-20 15:25:19	+abbyaha	i got a gift card for eater
2017-04-20 15:25:23	+abbyaha	so its free for me too
2017-04-20 15:25:31	+abbyaha	easter*
2017-04-20 15:25:50	+tr4656_	Basically it's somewhat sweet except theres this blue stuff that gets mixed with some parts of the drink
2017-04-20 15:25:54	+tr4656_	and the blue stuff makes it sour
2017-04-20 15:25:59	+tr4656_	Has no coffee taste at all
2017-04-20 15:26:26	+tr4656_	I thought it would taste more fruity but its only somewhat fruity in taste too
2017-04-20 15:26:27	+tr4656_	Ugh
2017-04-20 15:26:35	+abbyaha	hmmmmmmm
2017-04-20 15:26:36	+abbyaha	idk then
2017-04-20 15:26:44	+abbyaha	might go for my usual then
2017-04-20 15:27:19	+tr4656_	I couldn't taste any coffee at all
2017-04-20 15:27:31	+abbyaha	im not sure theres coffee in it
2017-04-20 15:27:39	+abbyaha	might just be a vanilla bean frap with sour shit
2017-04-20 15:28:08	+tr4656_	But take this with a grain salt because I rarely order anything at Starbucks and when I do it's basically always clover stuff
2017-04-20 15:28:47	+zekkin	ok someone doesn't understand voice highlander
2017-04-20 15:29:06	+tr4656_	oh great
2017-04-20 15:29:20	+zekkin	I'll let it slide!
2017-04-20 15:29:28	+zekkin	if you lose voice you're out
2017-04-20 15:29:37	+zekkin	there can only be one.
2017-04-20 15:29:38	+tr4656_	now starbucks has ran out of unicorn frap and postmates canceled my order
2017-04-20 15:29:43	+tr4656_	:/
2017-04-20 15:31:41	+abbyaha	wtf
2017-04-20 15:33:18	+bubbrubb	https://goo.gl/photos/G8nLbA6xgxxsWmdT9
2017-04-20 15:33:24	+bubbrubb	my work spot right now
2017-04-20 15:33:44	+abbyaha	:O
2017-04-20 15:33:49	+abbyaha	bubbrubb: i miss you come back
2017-04-20 15:34:06	+SlabDabs	nice
2017-04-20 15:34:10	+bubbrubb	:D
2017-04-20 15:34:20	--	You are now known as keveloper
2017-04-20 15:34:20	+SlabDabs	I wish I was outside instead of standing here unable to do my prints since people are in the way
2017-04-20 15:34:33	+na_th_an	keveloper: can you see your screen at all
2017-04-20 15:34:39	+keveloper	yeah
2017-04-20 15:34:42	+na_th_an	whenever I have my macbook outside I can't see the screen
2017-04-20 15:34:45	+na_th_an	too dark
2017-04-20 15:34:46	+keveloper	yeah its rough
2017-04-20 15:35:01	arij_work	whats with everyone having macbooks
2017-04-20 15:35:19	+keveloper	arij_work: easy way for developers to use unix i guess?
2017-04-20 15:35:35	+keveloper	idk most of the devs at my company have macbook pros
2017-04-20 15:35:43	+abbyaha	^^^
2017-04-20 15:35:46	+abbyaha	same keveloper
2017-04-20 15:35:47	arij_work	sheeple
2017-04-20 15:35:53	+na_th_an	arij_work: because corporations want operating systems with support
2017-04-20 15:35:54	arij_work	same?! dont you twowork together?
2017-04-20 15:35:55	+keveloper	arij_work: i didn't choose
2017-04-20 15:36:00	+keveloper	na_th_an++
2017-04-20 15:36:02	+na_th_an	but devs want a *nix
2017-04-20 15:36:07	+na_th_an	so they compromise with osx
2017-04-20 15:36:08	arij_work	that makes more sense
2017-04-20 15:36:14	+na_th_an	because we're too dumb to administer our own linux boxes
2017-04-20 15:36:15	+abbyaha	lol ya arij_work keveloper and i sit back to back
2017-04-20 15:36:18	+abbyaha	was joke

2017-04-20 15:37:13	arij_work	lul
2017-04-20 15:37:38	+keveloper	rude
2017-04-20 15:37:43	+na_th_an	true tho
2017-04-20 15:37:45	arij_work	poor kev
2017-04-20 15:38:03	+tr4656_	I mean another factor is just that macbooks are pretty nice hardware wise
2017-04-20 15:38:13	+abbyaha	i have a mbp at home
2017-04-20 15:38:14	+abbyaha	i love it

2017-04-20 15:38:47	arij_work	google pixel
2017-04-20 15:38:50	+abbyaha	nice
2017-04-20 15:39:04	+na_th_an	abbyaha: build a desktop
2017-04-20 15:39:11	arij_work	i used to have a vertu
2017-04-20 15:39:19	+tr4656_	did you really?
2017-04-20 15:39:21	arij_work	i lied
2017-04-20 15:39:23	arij_work	i never had a vertu
2017-04-20 15:39:26	+abbyaha	:O
2017-04-20 15:39:30	+tr4656_	That's expected
2017-04-20 15:39:49	+tr4656_	Vertus are just dumb
2017-04-20 15:39:55	arij_work	tr4656_: surprised some one actually knew what it was tho
2017-04-20 15:40:19	+na_th_an	I've never heard of that before
2017-04-20 15:40:23	+tr4656_	I thought people know what they are
2017-04-20 15:40:30	+SlabDabs	I'd happily use an apple computer. I would never pay for it though
2017-04-20 15:40:32	+tr4656_	it's a phone for dumb rich people
2017-04-20 15:40:47	+tr4656_	I like my main laptop, I just hate having no storage on it
2017-04-20 15:40:58	+tr4656_	(CB Pixel LS)
2017-04-20 15:40:59	+SlabDabs	this is why I say apple COMPUTER
2017-04-20 15:41:07	+SlabDabs	fuck iOS with all my possible hate and rage
2017-04-20 15:41:12	+tr4656_	wut
2017-04-20 15:41:14	+na_th_an	I'm somewhat happily using a macbook I didn't pay for
2017-04-20 15:41:14	arij_work	+1 slabdabs
2017-04-20 15:41:16	+tr4656_	I like iOS a lot
2017-04-20 15:41:20	+na_th_an	I wish every day it was linux tho
2017-04-20 15:41:28	+SlabDabs	tr4656_: enjoy not being able to natively download files
2017-04-20 15:41:39	+na_th_an	i'd enjoy being able to configure the window manager in osx
2017-04-20 15:41:47	+tr4656_	SlabDabs: It's not really that big of a deal
2017-04-20 15:41:53	+SlabDabs	to you maybe
2017-04-20 15:41:54	+na_th_an	for you
2017-04-20 15:41:57	+SlabDabs	lol
2017-04-20 15:42:02	+tr4656_	I guess
2017-04-20 15:42:18	+SlabDabs	I do design work, I need to be able to access and download my files as if I have a god damn downloads folder all my apps can access
2017-04-20 15:42:22	+na_th_an	I also like being able to write code for devices I own without having to pay for the privilege
2017-04-20 15:42:25	+SlabDabs	you can NOT get that with iOS
2017-04-20 15:42:42	+tr4656_	I mean I've used Android for a long time and still carry around an Android phone
2017-04-20 15:42:56	+tr4656_	Depends on what you do for sure, but I've never had it be that much of an issue
2017-04-20 15:43:15	+na_th_an	is there a way to ssh on ios yet
2017-04-20 15:43:16	+tr4656_	And there are ways to pass around files, just more annoying than having a direct file manager
2017-04-20 15:43:24	+SlabDabs	I've had it be a major issue trying to just do basic things with iOS because of how locked down it is
2017-04-20 15:43:25	+tr4656_	na_th_an: Like ssh into other machines?
2017-04-20 15:43:28	+na_th_an	yeah
2017-04-20 15:43:34	+tr4656_	Yeah, there's plenty of apps
2017-04-20 15:43:37	+tr4656_	Has been for yearrs now
2017-04-20 15:43:37	+SlabDabs	and MAJOR issues with them crashing
2017-04-20 15:43:45	+SlabDabs	since it's so locked you can't recover a single thing
2017-04-20 15:43:55	+na_th_an	idk, my girlfriend's storage was full on her iphone
2017-04-20 15:43:55	+SlabDabs	"it just works" is such a load of shit
2017-04-20 15:44:08	+na_th_an	the only way to get photos off her iphone was through email unless we wanted to purchase more icloud storage
2017-04-20 15:44:15	+SlabDabs	yep
2017-04-20 15:44:16	+tr4656_	na_th_an: USB?
2017-04-20 15:44:19	+na_th_an	no way to hook up the phone to a windows or linux computer over usb
2017-04-20 15:44:20	+na_th_an	nope
2017-04-20 15:44:22	+na_th_an	only mac
2017-04-20 15:44:26	+tr4656_	You can on Windows
2017-04-20 15:44:27	+SlabDabs	if you want to sync them to itunes maybe
2017-04-20 15:44:28	+na_th_an	nope
2017-04-20 15:44:28	+tr4656_	I've done it before...
2017-04-20 15:44:29	+na_th_an	you can't
2017-04-20 15:44:31	+na_th_an	not any more
2017-04-20 15:44:34	+na_th_an	I looked it up
2017-04-20 15:44:41	+na_th_an	it specifically said to download the icloud manager
2017-04-20 15:44:43	+tr4656_	Is that really true?
2017-04-20 15:44:46	+na_th_an	and to upload to icloud
2017-04-20 15:44:48	+na_th_an	then download on windows
2017-04-20 15:44:49	+na_th_an	yes
2017-04-20 15:44:51	+na_th_an	from apple's website
2017-04-20 15:44:56	+na_th_an	that's what it said to do under the windows section
2017-04-20 15:45:26	+na_th_an	she has a macbook but the osx upgrade fails every time so she can't install new enough software to actually access the phone
2017-04-20 15:45:29	+na_th_an	but no, it just works!
2017-04-20 15:45:30	+SlabDabs	you can *attempt* to use third party programs like ifunbox
2017-04-20 15:45:34	+tr4656_	https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201302
2017-04-20 15:45:38	+SlabDabs	but if it's locked, or crashed you're fucked
2017-04-20 15:45:39	+tr4656_	That's not what it says
2017-04-20 15:45:55	+SlabDabs	>using iCloud Photo Library
2017-04-20 15:46:03	+na_th_an	tr4656_: when I searched for iphone 6s that's what apples documentation said to do
2017-04-20 15:46:11	+tr4656_	>Import to your PC
2017-04-20 15:46:16	+SlabDabs	and as I expected, it required itunes to sync through
2017-04-20 15:46:41	+SlabDabs	"Photos and videos that you sync from your computer to your iOS device using iTunes can't be imported back to your computer. "
2017-04-20 15:46:41	+tr4656_	Look, do you actually want me to give you screenshot evidence?
2017-04-20 15:46:48	+SlabDabs	why would and should that EVER be the case
2017-04-20 15:46:51	+SlabDabs	yes
2017-04-20 15:46:51	arij_work	lol wat
2017-04-20 15:46:55	arij_work	apple is a meme
2017-04-20 15:47:07	+SlabDabs	show me how you can plug in an iphone and transfer files without jumping through hoops
2017-04-20 15:47:19	+tr4656_	okay

2017-04-20 15:50:48	+SlabDabs	a basic as fuck limited mobile OS that holds you nuts in a vice
2017-04-20 15:50:49	+tr4656_	But especially for tablets, I find iOS to be way superior
2017-04-20 15:50:57	+SlabDabs	if you don't want to adjust or do anything it's fine
2017-04-20 15:51:13	+SlabDabs	ugh tablets it pisses me off even more because I expect more open of options

2017-04-21 10:45:37	arij	oh alright lol i guess im not the only one then
2017-04-21 10:46:02	SlabDabs	Not at all, it's the biggest complaint in any review
2017-04-21 10:46:36	arij	such a huge oversight on their part... why just why
2017-04-21 10:46:53	arij	wouldnt mind if it just screwed onto the back too

2017-04-21 10:56:11	keveloper	◯ ◡ ◯
2017-04-21 10:58:06	abbyaha	y AUEW
2017-04-21 10:58:08	abbyaha	oops
2017-04-21 10:58:10	abbyaha	what
2017-04-21 10:58:12	abbyaha	ya sure*
2017-04-21 10:58:21	keveloper	yayy
2017-04-21 11:00:25	SlabDabs	arij: yeah, since it hits the threads it doesn't sit well at all, and I don't like forcing it on since I don't want to mess up the threads
2017-04-21 11:00:38	SlabDabs	the weight and balance of it is pretty good though without the cap on so i'm happy about that at least
2017-04-21 11:00:50	SlabDabs	a few of my pens balance better with the caps on, but I generally like to go without
2017-04-21 11:01:29	arij	i see
2017-04-21 11:02:09	arij	yea i dont mind it without the cap on the back either - stil feels nice
2017-04-21 11:04:02	SlabDabs	yep
2017-04-21 11:04:18	SlabDabs	more of an issue with short pens or really light ones, the piston in this makes the back balance back out
2017-04-21 11:05:56	abbyaha	i usually like caps on, i think since i have small hands it feels better in my hand
2017-04-21 11:06:07	na_th_an	you don't have a fountain pen abbyaha
2017-04-21 11:06:09	na_th_an	liar
2017-04-21 11:06:15	abbyaha	lol okay
2017-04-21 11:06:44	arij	SlabDabs: am i doing this correctly? https://puu.sh/vryzq/61d6c0d1a5.jpg

2017-04-21 11:09:03	keveloper	na_th_an: it would make you a weirdo
2017-04-21 11:09:10	abbyaha	na_th_an: i wouldnt judge
2017-04-21 11:09:12	arij	i replaced two monitors with this one - great choice imo

2017-04-21 11:09:42	na_th_an	"who does that guy think he his"
2017-04-21 11:09:47	keveloper	arij: what do you mean by 'im feeling it now'

2017-04-21 14:12:05	keveloper	how was leasing
2017-04-21 14:12:07	keveloper	was it worth it
2017-04-21 14:12:11	arij	but i wrecked the 4 so my lease ended early
2017-04-21 14:12:12	keveloper	did you feel like you wasted money
2017-04-21 14:12:14	keveloper	oh
2017-04-21 14:12:15	keveloper	wlel
2017-04-21 14:12:23	keveloper	the thing i dont like about leasing is not owning the car when its up
2017-04-21 14:12:35	arij	and i was wayy over the milage limit - so crashing it helped me actually or else i would have had to payy a bunch of extra money at the end of the lease
2017-04-21 14:12:37	keveloper	and you never really own it
2017-04-21 14:12:41	keveloper	and mileage limits
2017-04-21 14:12:50	arij	yea that part kind of sucks
2017-04-21 14:12:57	keveloper	i dont think i'll ever lease
2017-04-21 14:13:19	keveloper	i'm proably just stupid but i dont understand the value in leasing
2017-04-21 14:13:24	keveloper	it doesn't seem like a good deal most of the time
2017-04-21 14:13:32	arij	you can get a car that you normally wouldnt be able to afford?
2017-04-21 14:13:45	keveloper	or buy 2-3 years used
2017-04-21 14:13:53	keveloper	after init depreciation

2017-04-21 14:14:48	na_th_an	keveloper: you should sell your car

2017-04-22 14:45:32	+SlabDabs	only time i've ever had an issue with irccloud in like two years is when servers like freenode have a massive netsplit and then it lags everyone logging back in. But I know they even worked on that and I haven't had it happen in like half a year

2017-04-23 14:11:52	+tr4656_	And the all open workspace hall is extremely long
2017-04-23 14:12:11	+tr4656_	so much so it's disorientating

2017-04-23 16:13:38	SlabDabs	xveamvx: if you set the voice flag on a channel only those with 'voice' can talk
2017-04-23 16:13:56	SlabDabs	some rooms do it so you can lurk but have to register (which would auto voice you presumably) to talk
2017-04-23 16:14:10	SlabDabs	and things like that, or if a room gets too crazy you can use it to shut everyone up

2017-04-23 19:29:49	abbyaha	are you loving it as much as everyone else?

2017-04-23 19:40:57	switchy	zekkin, is there lots of busywork?
2017-04-23 19:43:46	zekkin	the beginning they hold your hand a tiny bit

2017-04-23 19:44:48	zekkin	the fact that it's a zelda game with over 50 hours of content makes it worth it to me
2017-04-23 19:44:53	zekkin	it's such a pretty game
2017-04-23 19:59:04	switchy	zekkin, would it still be fun if I've never played zelda before?
2017-04-23 19:59:16	zekkin	hmm
2017-04-23 19:59:17	zekkin	i think so

2017-04-24 00:48:09	abbyaha	but imo you do have one
2017-04-24 00:48:33	abbyaha	how long ago was it that you found out she doesnt like you back?

2017-04-24 11:54:19	SlabDabs	love the 1.1 once I got used to it. Probably another 1.1 arij but a different model
2017-04-24 11:54:55	SlabDabs	i have a few people I'm talking to. someone has a 580AL Lava with 1.1... but he's in Germany, so shipping makes it a few bucks more than the currently available colors
2017-04-24 11:55:39	arij	omg your making me regret getting a medium nib
2017-04-24 11:55:42	arij	like 1.1 is the best

2017-04-24 11:58:53	arij	whhy

2017-04-24 12:00:41	SlabDabs	You can get replacement nib/feed's though
2017-04-24 12:00:51	arij	do i nee just a nib or both
2017-04-24 12:00:56	SlabDabs	BUT the stub is terrible to use on shitty paper or if you need to do anything fine
2017-04-24 12:01:09	SlabDabs	arij: you should just need a nib, but I think they only sell them together
2017-04-24 12:01:28	arij	i think i want broad
2017-04-24 12:01:39	arij	they just didnt have the option... maybe ill order one from nib grinder
2017-04-24 12:02:15	SlabDabs	Yeah, some sizes go out of stock. this specific one is out of stock but I'm sure you can find it somewhere else too https://www.gouletpens.com/twsbi-vac-mini-steel-nib-unit-1.1mm-stub/p/TW-M7444790

2017-04-24 12:02:49	SlabDabs	you would get free shipping too since it's over $25
2017-04-24 12:02:51	arij	i thinki want broad tho
2017-04-24 12:02:57	arij	have you used broad
2017-04-24 12:02:59	SlabDabs	no
2017-04-24 12:03:16	arij	1.1 seems a bit excessive for normal writing at work and stuff
2017-04-24 12:03:19	arij	idunno tho
2017-04-24 12:03:45	arij	also do you still want this metro - its the grey one - and the ergodox tops

2017-04-24 13:06:01	SlabDabs	there are certainly things I don't like about it, but i'm fucking sick of paying over 1k a month on an apartment
2017-04-24 13:06:01	abbyaha	slaytaner: thats fair and all, but florida
2017-04-24 13:06:11	abbyaha	why not NY, NY is the best state in the country

2017-04-24 13:07:23	SlabDabs	and i'll happily pay illegal prices if I'm paying $600 less a month in housing to own a 2/2 vs renting a 1/1

2017-04-24 13:10:59	keveloper	liking guns != wanting to shoot somebody

2017-04-24 13:13:03	slaytaner	unless it's a taurus

2017-04-24 16:35:35	tr4656_	I would say it really only shows up well on broader nibs
2017-04-24 16:36:03	tr4656_	I sometimes see it on say a western Fine
2017-04-24 16:36:14	tr4656_	But really, shows up better on a italic or broad
2017-04-24 16:36:17	abbyaha	i prefer fine-medium but i would def write with a broader one for that

2017-04-24 17:18:17	SlabDabs	math in pen is fine if you're not worried about things possibly getting messy
2017-04-24 17:18:22	SlabDabs	well, replace math with anything
2017-04-24 17:27:12	arij	SlabDabs: you have experience with lasercutting, amirite
2017-04-24 17:27:41	SlabDabs	yeah
2017-04-24 17:29:14	arij	what kind of speed and power settings should i use to cut 8mm acrylic in a single pass
2017-04-24 17:29:21	arij	60% power, 2% speed?
2017-04-24 17:31:37	SlabDabs	I mean, that varies for each machine, I used to take scrap and just do test cuts on it
2017-04-24 17:31:48	SlabDabs	to make sure I'm cutting through enough at a good speed
2017-04-24 17:32:40	arij	i see
2017-04-24 17:33:07	arij	is it normal to see condensation in the cap of my pen
2017-04-24 17:33:49	SlabDabs	there was a video about that 4 days ago https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_IVHDhV57M
2017-04-24 17:35:38	slaytaner	xveamvx ella got the porche
2017-04-24 17:55:01	slaytaner	oh shit xveamvx
2017-04-24 17:56:42	xveamvx	wut
2017-04-24 17:56:54	arij	SlabDabs: whats he say
2017-04-24 17:56:58	slaytaner	ella got a gun to anime girls head
2017-04-24 17:57:00	arij	i never washed it or anything , just inked it
2017-04-24 17:57:19	SlabDabs	arij: I haven't watched, but I'm assuming something about how it's normal since you use water based inks pretty much
2017-04-24 17:57:29	arij	oh ok
2017-04-24 17:58:24	slaytaner	xveamvx somebody gonna get shot
2017-04-24 17:58:25	arij	SlabDabs: is it bad that i removed the cap insert
2017-04-24 17:58:27	arij	it looked ugly
2017-04-24 17:58:34	slaytaner	or pistol whipped
2017-04-24 17:59:35	SlabDabs	arij: I'm not sure if it influences anything at all
2017-04-24 18:00:17	SlabDabs	it probably just helps if any ink leaks, maybe with an air tight seal depending how well the clip is fixed onto it
2017-04-24 18:00:34	SlabDabs	heh I totally see a tiny amount of condensation in mine
2017-04-24 18:00:51	arij	ah alright so thats normal then
2017-04-24 18:02:56	SlabDabs	yeah I'd assume so, you have a wet ink in an enclosed area that can potentially be warm from ambient temperature and heat from being in a pocket
2017-04-24 18:24:56	slaytaner	rip switchy

2017-04-24 20:19:02	na_th_an	i think there's a race condition when it boots
2017-04-24 20:19:14	na_th_an	because it runs a ton of services and stuff

2017-04-24 20:36:20	na_th_an	but kodi starts and dbus isn't fully initialized or something and then kodi can't open ports or connect to pulseaudio
2017-04-24 20:36:42	na_th_an	I could delay starting kodi more but I've been meaning to move this all to an SSD anyway
2017-04-24 20:37:01	na_th_an	I already have a bunch of stuff starting on a delayed timer

2017-04-25 11:11:30	abbyaha	also SlabDabs did you buy a full thing of the apache sunset ink?
2017-04-25 11:12:11	arij	i have a sample of that ink
2017-04-25 11:12:36	arij	is that the diamond mini or?
2017-04-25 11:12:53	abbyaha	nah the full size
2017-04-25 11:13:00	abbyaha	580AL or w/e
2017-04-25 11:13:37	SlabDabs	I have two bottles abbyaha
2017-04-25 11:14:03	SlabDabs	I'm heavily considering getting a 580AL as well
2017-04-25 11:14:14	SlabDabs	someone would sell me their Lava one with a 1.1 nib
2017-04-25 11:14:26	abbyaha	if you dont like it and want to sell a bottle of it i would probs buy
2017-04-25 11:14:38	abbyaha	i am getting into lettering/calligraphy and think it would be good for that
2017-04-25 11:14:49	SlabDabs	shipping since it's from germany brings it to be $10 more than a new one.... but the color is discontinued
2017-04-25 11:14:56	abbyaha	what color?
2017-04-25 11:14:57	SlabDabs	ah, well they bottles are totally different shades
2017-04-25 11:15:03	SlabDabs	'Lava'
2017-04-25 11:15:05	SlabDabs	it's a red orange
2017-04-25 11:15:37	SlabDabs	i only have two bottles of apache since my first one was so light and I emailed them about it and they sent me a replacement
2017-04-25 11:15:50	abbyaha	ahhhhh now i remember
2017-04-25 11:15:52	SlabDabs	I'd say hop on amazon though, you can get noodler's prime for 12.50
2017-04-25 11:16:57	abbyaha	i think im set on getting the pink 580AL, though the silver is v nice
2017-04-25 11:17:13	SlabDabs	I like the blue
2017-04-25 11:17:28	SlabDabs	but the pink just doesn't appeal to me
2017-04-25 11:17:40	abbyaha	im into that whole rose gold fad rn

2017-04-25 11:18:36	abbyaha	but the pen is still v nice, obv
2017-04-25 11:25:26	SlabDabs	Just like how I don't love pink but can still appreciate it ;)
2017-04-25 11:25:58	abbyaha	exactly!

2017-04-25 11:33:26	SlabDabs	abbyaha: what nib are you getting?
2017-04-25 11:33:49	abbyaha	im going for medium
2017-04-25 11:33:53	SlabDabs	and if you don't know, what are you going to use it for and I can try and help direct
2017-04-25 11:34:10	SlabDabs	nice, keep in mind a 'western medium' will be a lot broader than a japanese one

2017-04-25 11:35:31	abbyaha	ya i saw that
2017-04-25 11:35:35	abbyaha	the 1.1 is interesting
2017-04-25 11:35:40	abbyaha	but i dont think i would use it as much
2017-04-25 11:36:15	abbyaha	i actually might get the 1.1 nib to play with too
2017-04-25 11:36:22	SlabDabs	I have one and love it for entertaining writing, but if I was stuck not knowing what notebook/paper i'm using and such it would be tiring
2017-04-25 11:36:46	SlabDabs	gives you a flex look more consistently and with less maintenance
2017-04-25 11:36:56	abbyaha	do you do calligraphy or just go for everyday writing?
2017-04-25 11:39:01	SlabDabs	I'm trying to learn a bit more, I always wrote like shit so I'm making an effort to be better
2017-04-25 11:39:11	arij	i started with Fine and now i have a Medium
2017-04-25 11:39:26	arij	Medium is nice

2017-04-25 11:51:40	SlabDabs	that's a nice ink. Diamine Marine is a nice ink too, light so it looks good in clear pens
2017-04-25 11:52:33	arij	dunno if i should order a sample or just order the bottle
2017-04-25 11:52:53	arij	i have too many samples already

2017-04-25 12:54:27	na_th_an	i know the feel

2017-04-25 12:54:49	xveamvx	I sometimes don't have enough motivation to get out bed
2017-04-25 12:54:52	xveamvx	Shit sucks
2017-04-25 12:55:16	na_th_an	honestly it's way harder with school than anything else in my experience
2017-04-25 12:55:30	na_th_an	school is full of so much bullshit and wasted time in classes that it's hard to motivate myself to go to anything
2017-04-25 12:55:40	na_th_an	it was depressing to be spending so much money on something I hated
2017-04-25 12:55:50	na_th_an	and there's no set schedule, which makes it easy to skip classes
2017-04-25 12:56:00	na_th_an	whereas with work, I follow basically the same schedule every work day
2017-04-25 12:56:09	na_th_an	so it's way easier to get out of bed and follow my morning routine
2017-04-25 12:56:22	xveamvx	Yup
2017-04-25 12:56:23	na_th_an	when I'm at work I actually do things. Even when I'm sitting in a bullshit meeting, I'm getting paid
2017-04-25 12:56:33	xveamvx	I wish I could just get a good job now
2017-04-25 12:56:50	na_th_an	college is basically a giant weed out course for jobs
2017-04-25 12:57:14	xveamvx	Im getting all A's in my major classes
2017-04-25 12:57:25	xveamvx	But getting C's in the other bullshit
2017-04-25 12:57:32	na_th_an	yeah I know that feel

2017-04-26 13:51:05	SlabDabs	the shimmer of the seas and EoC can slightly clog a feed, but you can rinse it out. fire and ice will need a nice paper like Tomoe River to really show, maybe some Rhodia

2017-04-26 14:06:35	keveloper	about to make #realBeyblades
2017-04-26 14:06:43	zekkin	if the channel actually had people from a beyblade forum or subreddit coming and going asking questions i probably would just transfer the founder flag

2017-04-26 14:07:35	keveloper	abbyaha: um no
2017-04-26 14:07:40	xveamvx	no it's because of keveloper typed it in mechboards

2017-04-26 14:13:11	SlabDabs	arij: did you kinda slosh the ink around in the sample to get the particulate mixed around before filling?
2017-04-26 14:13:17	xveamvx	and I need someone to cover my shift friday through sunday
2017-04-26 14:13:19	SlabDabs	because the shimmer settles
2017-04-26 14:13:32	SlabDabs	or the sample could have been pretty low on it, which i'd email them about if it really is missing
2017-04-26 14:14:00	zekkin	are all of you in columbus
2017-04-26 14:14:11	zekkin	arij is in CT or something

2017-04-26 15:28:38	arij	slaytaner: leanboiz
2017-04-26 15:28:46	slaytaner	lol
2017-04-26 15:32:28	SlabDabs	keveloper: iirc selling a car that is still owed on requires you and the buyer to go by the bank you have the loan with, they essentially pay that off and give you the rest
2017-04-26 15:32:32	SlabDabs	I could be wrong though
2017-04-26 15:32:57	keveloper	SlabDabs: there's a lot of ways to do it  but the trick is you can't transfer the title while you owe money on the car
2017-04-26 15:33:00	keveloper	i just looked it up lol
2017-04-26 15:33:21	keveloper	the buyer can pay the bank and then pay you the rest
2017-04-26 15:34:08	keveloper	SlabDabs: also i have the loan through VW so idk how to do that lol
2017-04-26 15:36:23	na_th_an	call a dealership and tell them you want to get a new audi and trade in your vw
2017-04-26 15:36:32	na_th_an	I'd bet they'd make it pretty easy
2017-04-26 15:37:19	keveloper	yeah if they give me > 14,5 for the car
2017-04-26 15:37:47	na_th_an	so ask what the tradein value is
2017-04-26 15:38:05	na_th_an	you have power here as the person that wants to buy a car
2017-04-26 15:38:14	na_th_an	they want to sell it to you
2017-04-26 15:38:29	na_th_an	as long as they want the sale more than you want a new car you're good
2017-04-26 15:42:37	SlabDabs	keveloper: Hmm yeah that's why I was thinking if you both went in together and provided the remainder they could title transfer. But really I'd just call VW. They're the ones getting paid to know this lol
2017-04-26 15:46:01	keveloper	idk i seriously want to do this
2017-04-26 15:46:08	keveloper	i found a car i want tho lol

2017-04-26 17:45:38	arij	SlabDabs: y u do this to me
2017-04-26 17:45:43	SlabDabs	well it's not like ballpoints where it all ends up the same
2017-04-26 17:46:04	SlabDabs	different nibs and fill systems and such..
2017-04-26 17:46:05	arij	i have a fine, have a medium, just want one more with either broad or 1.1
2017-04-26 17:46:13	arij	just so i have a good variety of nibs
2017-04-26 17:46:30	SlabDabs	i'd go with some type of stub or italic instead of a broad
2017-04-26 17:46:47	arij	ya or that, i kind of put those in the same category, not that ive ever used any of them
2017-04-26 17:46:54	SlabDabs	yeah
2017-04-26 17:47:07	SlabDabs	they're usually in the same category on websites
2017-04-26 17:47:13	arij	any suggestions for a stub
2017-04-26 17:47:21	arij	flex is for caligraphy right?
2017-04-26 17:47:34	SlabDabs	i've only used my eco stub. ehhh kinda, flex is flex
2017-04-26 17:47:48	SlabDabs	you can use it for normal writing but it gives you that caligraphy look
2017-04-26 17:47:59	SlabDabs	since it's not a constant line width
2017-04-26 17:48:02	arij	i see
2017-04-26 17:48:09	SlabDabs	but the stub does a decent job at getting a similar effect
2017-04-26 17:48:17	arij	stub gives line variation as well?
2017-04-26 17:49:51	SlabDabs	yes, since the nib going 'sideways' will produce a thin line, but going 'down' it's wide

2017-04-26 18:04:35	arij	only thing i dont like about that pen is the filling mechanism
2017-04-26 18:04:37	SlabDabs	and decent modern ones are expensive

2017-04-26 18:04:45	SlabDabs	ah yeah
2017-04-26 18:04:54	SlabDabs	well it should be the same as a vac fill with a 1.1

2017-04-27 15:04:37	abbyaha	thats why i liked him
2017-04-27 15:04:43	zekkin	my ex won't leave me alone
2017-04-27 15:04:48	keveloper	but he made you stir carbonation out of his drinks
2017-04-27 15:04:51	zekkin	i've been such a bad friend but she still keeps trying
2017-04-27 15:05:09	abbyaha	idk i dont really think you can be friends with someone who is in love with you
2017-04-27 15:05:21	abbyaha	might be best to go no contact
2017-04-27 15:05:30	zekkin	we dated a long time ago
2017-04-27 15:05:33	zekkin	which makes it funnier
2017-04-27 15:05:48	keveloper	zekkin: ive tried that it never works
2017-04-27 15:06:03	keveloper	always ended up hooking and getting back together then regretting it and starting the long process of breaking up again
2017-04-27 15:06:18	zekkin	that'd probably happen if i were still in NY

2017-04-27 15:07:03	zekkin	being single is ok
2017-04-27 15:07:10	abbyaha	good but im more talking like ASAP and unblocking when youre ready and completely done

2017-04-27 15:07:28	abbyaha	it at least makes it harder

2017-04-27 15:09:00	zekkin	i think that's different though
2017-04-27 15:09:04	keveloper	zekkin: no she doesn't like me
2017-04-27 15:09:29	keveloper	then i say 'if you call me dude again im gonna throw you out of the window'

2017-04-28 16:40:35	switchy	since I think my phone accesses it through the exchange protocol

2017-04-29 14:24:54	arij	might be easier
2017-04-29 14:28:10	SlabDabs	I personally like having multiple, then you can have a few colors and be able to write with a normal tip or finer tip for quick writing and cheap paper, still have the stub for fancier writing
2017-04-29 14:28:34	tr4656_	I wonder if you can use 1.1 though
2017-04-29 14:29:02	arij	what do you mean
2017-04-29 14:29:08	arij	i just ordered the 1.1 tho
2017-04-29 14:29:11	arij	i guess i could cancel it
2017-04-29 14:54:58	tr4656_	Well it's a very wide nib

2017-04-30 10:46:06	abbyaha	i got both!
2017-04-30 10:46:33	arij	did you get to use both yet?
2017-04-30 10:47:03	abbyaha	yea! both super good, the diamond has a nicer feel thought, which makes sense since its higher quality
2017-04-30 10:47:10	abbyaha	i would def recommend the stub nib though
2017-04-30 10:47:14	abbyaha	i LOVE it

2017-04-30 10:57:14	SlabDabs	yeah the ecos are certainly the more 'budget' pen but they are still real nice. I mean they're around $30 iirc
2017-04-30 10:57:30	SlabDabs	abbyaha: have you heard of bullet journaling?
2017-04-30 10:57:58	arij	anyone want a free sample of shimmering seas

2017-04-30 10:59:09	arij	i dont think ill use either of those and theres probably enough to get a 3/4 fill or so on each
2017-04-30 10:59:28	abbyaha	SlabDabs: yea ive been thinking of getting into bullet journalling
2017-04-30 10:59:32	abbyaha	arij: pick me!

2017-04-30 10:59:51	arij	the thing is the shimmering seas looks a little too purple for me
2017-04-30 10:59:59	SlabDabs	Yeah as much as I will take any and all pen samples and anything else, abbyaha needs to boost that collection ;)
2017-04-30 11:00:02	abbyaha	i journal every day but im too impatient to get the bullet journalling set up haha
2017-04-30 11:00:07	arij	might have gotten some left over purple in it or maybe its supposed to be that color
2017-04-30 11:00:27	abbyaha	well i love purple too soooooo
2017-04-30 11:00:30	SlabDabs	abbyaha: you can do it REALLLLLY basic, all the stuff you see on tumblr and the likes is overly flourished

2017-04-30 11:04:18	SlabDabs	yeah, I took like a month starting mine because I was too worried about doing it right and all that, when really you need to just jump in, try things and see it evolvle
2017-04-30 11:06:45	abbyaha	and i mean, i do take other risks, just not with my money lol
2017-04-30 11:06:56	arij	psh like what

2017-04-30 11:07:20	SlabDabs	i'd have to have money to take risks with
2017-04-30 11:07:28	SlabDabs	abbyaha: same, I'm a graphic designer.....

2017-04-30 11:11:42	SlabDabs	in the spirit of that I totally get it abbyaha I want to juts do it right, not half ass it. But realistically, that's not how things go, you have to start somewhere and build upon your experience. My personal journal I haven't been able to apply that as much to, but I have a mini disposable work one that has certainly helped out and has helped me build a
2017-04-30 11:11:42	SlabDabs	foundation for my personal one
2017-04-30 11:13:09	abbyaha	oh i know it, i just put the bar too high and then get upset when im not artistic enough to reach it lol

2017-04-30 20:56:34	DonaldTrump	Weve had "very experienced" politicians in there for quite a while
2017-04-30 20:56:34	xveamvx	several bankruptcies
2017-04-30 20:56:44	DonaldTrump	and we are 20 trillion in debt
2017-04-30 20:56:53	DonaldTrump	how can you argue that
2017-04-30 20:57:11	DonaldTrump	Obama alone created more debt than every previous president combined

2017-04-30 22:09:53	tr4656_	1.5 1 1 1.5 2.25?
2017-04-30 22:10:02	tr4656_	I guess might be a bit hard to find key 1.5
2017-04-30 22:10:24	arij	https://puu.sh/vBDzT/d212e3de06.png
2017-04-30 22:11:31	arij	i also have another acrylic one that uses 1.25 1.25 1.25 1.25 2.25
2017-04-30 22:11:43	arij	then 2.75 1 1 1 1 1 1
2017-04-30 22:11:45	tr4656_	Probably either would be fine wiht me

2017-04-30 22:38:56	arij	ive been able to upgrade for $1000 at the gate before
2017-04-30 22:39:09	arij	pretty good deal on a 12hr flight #worth
2017-04-30 22:39:10	switchy	dang

2017-04-30 22:40:40	switchy	you can do an online upgrade bid but they start at $2500 aud
2017-04-30 22:43:01	slaytaner	that's too many dollarydoos
2017-04-30 22:43:15	switchy	yeah
2017-04-30 22:48:14	slaytaner	switchy are you going to be able to reintigrate
2017-04-30 22:54:04	switchy	slaytaner: there are a lot of Aussies in the airport
2017-04-30 22:54:11	switchy	what a terrible accent we have
2017-04-30 22:54:57	switchy	feels like home already
2017-04-30 23:01:18	switchy	yay computer
2017-04-30 23:01:34	slaytaner	idk your accent is alright
2017-04-30 23:01:59	switchy	yeah, I like to think mine is less bogan
2017-04-30 23:02:10	switchy	but I've heard some pretty shocking accents in the airport already
2017-04-30 23:03:37	switchy	slaytaner, how long do I have left here?
2017-04-30 23:03:45	slaytaner	too long
2017-04-30 23:04:05	switchy	nearly 4 hours
2017-04-30 23:04:08	switchy	ugh
2017-04-30 23:05:50	switchy	slaytaner, gee that job only started running 20 hours ago
2017-04-30 23:06:03	switchy	and then broke shortly afterwards anyway
2017-04-30 23:06:48	slaytaner	switchy if you'd've flown qantas out of dfw i'd've been able to take you to get dinner lol
2017-04-30 23:07:03	slaytaner	dem double contractions
2017-04-30 23:07:14	switchy	slaytaner, qantas didn't seem to want to fly to newark
2017-04-30 23:08:31	switchy	ugh there's a horrible high pitched noise
2017-04-30 23:11:04	slaytaner	yeah you'd probs have to do qantas to dfw then american to newark
2017-04-30 23:11:18	switchy	qantas codeshares with american though
2017-04-30 23:11:36	switchy	although they apparently don't codeshare to newark
2017-04-30 23:11:47	switchy	except newark does have qantas flights at one of the terminals?
2017-04-30 23:11:52	switchy	so I have no idea what's going on
2017-04-30 23:11:52	arij	should have left the airport
2017-04-30 23:12:02	arij	i know this really good spot in santa monica
2017-04-30 23:12:08	switchy	I just couldn't find any flights
2017-04-30 23:12:29	switchy	arij, yeah probs
2017-04-30 23:12:46	switchy	arij, I'm too tired to do anything useful though
2017-04-30 23:12:58	switchy	I just had a retarded expensive burger and now I'm just going to sit here for a few hours
2017-04-30 23:13:26	arij	true but what i would have done is fly to la, spend a day or two then do the next flight
2017-04-30 23:13:46	arij	less tiring
2017-04-30 23:15:02	switchy	arij, that probably would've felt like a good idea when I was booking, but I kinda just wanna get it over with
2017-04-30 23:15:34	arij	ya thats true as well
2017-04-30 23:15:57	arij	is your bike at the airport
2017-04-30 23:17:12	switchy	nah, it's in my dad's garage
2017-04-30 23:17:56	switchy	I wouldn't leave it there for 3 months!
2017-04-30 23:17:59	switchy	I'd be poor anyway

2017-04-30 23:23:52	slaytaner	find another one
2017-04-30 23:25:30	switchy	but that would involve moving!
2017-04-30 23:27:30	slaytaner	rip switchy
2017-04-30 23:30:27	switchy	I don't understand why this one doesn't work though
2017-04-30 23:30:29	switchy	the lights are blue!
2017-04-30 23:30:50	switchy	I wish there was a light on my power brick or something
2017-04-30 23:30:52	slaytaner	cause things are terrible
2017-04-30 23:31:16	switchy	correct
2017-04-30 23:31:38	switchy	computers are broken
2017-04-30 23:31:48	slaytaner	electricity is magic
2017-04-30 23:32:22	switchy	it basically is

2017-04-30 23:33:58	switchy	yay thinkpad

2017-04-30 23:52:42	slaytaner	yee
2017-04-30 23:53:18	switchy	openvpn is a little annoying to set up
2017-04-30 23:53:27	slaytaner	ansible
2017-04-30 23:54:00	switchy	I don't wanna use random ansible recipes from the interweb though
2017-04-30 23:56:16	slaytaner	switchy I guess I just install openvpn then do the rest manually
2017-04-30 23:56:25	slaytaner	it's not *that* bad
2017-04-30 23:56:37	switchy	slaytaner, yeah true

2017-05-01 10:45:23	zekkin	everyone looks better in monochrome
2017-05-01 10:45:45	abbyaha	i agree
2017-05-01 10:45:48	zekkin	i just feel more comfortable in darker colors anyway
2017-05-01 10:48:43	abbyaha	same
2017-05-01 10:49:47	na_th_an	I just keep thinking about a 1080ti, new case, and water cooling

2017-05-01 10:50:51	mmasco_	na_th_an: which 3rd party 1080ti would you get?
2017-05-01 10:50:53	na_th_an	mmasco_: I'm really thinking about doing a whole custom loop
2017-05-01 10:50:59	na_th_an	and if I do that I'd get a reference card
2017-05-01 10:52:12	abbyaha	oh na_th_an that tiramisu ice cream tho
2017-05-01 10:52:14	abbyaha	so good

2017-05-01 10:52:22	abbyaha	ya wtf
2017-05-01 10:52:23	na_th_an	better than jeni's and cheaper
2017-05-01 10:52:32	mmasco_	na_th_an: at first i wanted to custom loop my 290x build but the price is significantly higher when you factor in the water blocks pump res etc.
2017-05-01 10:52:41	na_th_an	yeah... it's not about price
2017-05-01 10:52:43	mmasco_	but they do look beautiful
2017-05-01 10:52:57	na_th_an	microcenter has ekg kits for like $300 or so
2017-05-01 10:53:20	na_th_an	I've just always wanted a top of the line computer
2017-05-01 10:53:27	na_th_an	I want to get right up to the line of wasting money
2017-05-01 10:53:29	na_th_an	but not cross it
2017-05-01 10:53:37	na_th_an	SLI is crossing the line of wasting money imo
2017-05-01 10:53:44	na_th_an	but water cooling is right up to that line
2017-05-01 10:53:45	mmasco_	true lol
2017-05-01 10:53:59	mmasco_	crossfire was my biggest mistake
2017-05-01 10:54:22	na_th_an	are you gonna upgrade once you get some salary $$$
2017-05-01 10:54:22	arij	i wear whatever i want to work
2017-05-01 10:54:27	na_th_an	1070s are pretty cheap these days
2017-05-01 10:54:34	abbyaha	same arij
2017-05-01 10:54:42	arij	can wear a hat if i feel like it
2017-05-01 10:54:48	mmasco_	ill upgrade maybe when fallout 4 vr comes out
2017-05-01 10:54:53	arij	but then again im usually working alone so
2017-05-01 10:54:57	na_th_an	fallout 4 vr better be incredible
2017-05-01 10:55:24	na_th_an	Q: "Do I really need a 1080 ti?" A: "Fallout 4 VR"
2017-05-01 10:55:32	na_th_an	I'm probably gonna take time off work for FO4VR
2017-05-01 10:55:32	mmasco_	ive been holding out on playing a lot of games due to gpu power
2017-05-01 10:55:35	na_th_an	which I've never done before
2017-05-01 10:55:50	na_th_an	yeah I bet :( even my 970 struggled on some things. I hear a lot of things are more optimized now tho
2017-05-01 10:55:57	na_th_an	but some things have a 980 as their minimum
2017-05-01 10:56:38	mmasco_	i cant even run dishonored2 at lowest settings at a stable/acceptable framerate
2017-05-01 10:56:50	na_th_an	:(
2017-05-01 10:56:59	na_th_an	I'm surprised you've been able to do as much as you have with your cards
2017-05-01 10:57:57	mmasco_	they do shine in some places like 1440p 80hz witcher 3 but sometimes they are just too weak
2017-05-01 10:58:14	na_th_an	the perils of sli/crossfire
2017-05-01 10:59:55	mmasco_	im thinking of getting doom2016 just because the vulkan implementation is on point
2017-05-01 11:00:18	mmasco_	and because the demo was fun i guess
2017-05-01 11:00:51	na_th_an	I've heard good things about it
2017-05-01 11:01:01	na_th_an	I bought doom 3 bfg to play in VR but haven't done it yet
2017-05-01 11:01:59	arij	holy shit
2017-05-01 11:02:04	arij	bitcoin is $1400
2017-05-01 11:02:13	na_th_an	wow

2017-05-01 11:04:17	zekkin	i wish i made more money
2017-05-01 11:08:19	abbyaha	same
2017-05-01 11:10:08	na_th_an	i got a promotion so I'm gonna make more money this month \o/
2017-05-01 11:10:26	na_th_an	my title still says Software Developer >_>
2017-05-01 11:10:35	na_th_an	that shit needs to update
2017-05-01 11:10:44	abbyaha	\o/
2017-05-01 11:15:01	zekkin	i got a 2% raise at the beginning of march
2017-05-01 11:15:20	zekkin	i didn't get the full 3% because i haven't been a full time employee for a full year
2017-05-01 11:15:42	na_th_an	that happened to me last year
2017-05-01 11:16:12	na_th_an	I got a positive performance review and was supposed to get a 2% or 3% raise but it was pro-rated to 1.5%
2017-05-01 11:16:20	na_th_an	less than inflation :/
2017-05-01 11:16:31	zekkin	yeah same basically
2017-05-01 11:17:14	zekkin	i wish i was more driven to get better at my job
2017-05-01 11:17:29	zekkin	it just seems like the people who get promoted are the types to invest thousands of dollars in homelab stuff
2017-05-01 11:17:30	na_th_an	I feel driven to get better at coding
2017-05-01 11:17:40	na_th_an	but I don't feel driven to get better at my job
2017-05-01 11:17:48	na_th_an	unfortunately my job isn't 100% coding
2017-05-01 11:17:53	zekkin	it doesn't help that our current superiors have no direction other than "business as usual"
2017-05-01 11:18:25	zekkin	i've felt pretty hopeless in the last few weeks
2017-05-01 11:18:40	na_th_an	I know the feel :(
2017-05-01 11:19:07	zekkin	yeah :( it's the job and having to deal with one specific person
2017-05-01 11:19:14	abbyaha	kind of how im feeling too, im going to be really discouraged if i dont get a promotion
2017-05-01 11:19:32	abbyaha	im taking on so much more work than my coworker in a similar role but higher position
2017-05-01 11:19:33	zekkin	this person basically got me my job and i've known him for over 10 years and considered him a best friend
2017-05-01 11:19:36	abbyaha	picking up his slack
2017-05-01 11:20:03	zekkin	but he's extremely selfcentered and can't admit to being wrong about shit
2017-05-01 11:20:22	zekkin	he also used one of my hobbies as an insult against someone else (assuming i wouldn't hear about it)
2017-05-01 11:22:12	zekkin	it's made me take a step back and really think about if this is the type of person i want to be friends with long term (even more so than it already has been)
2017-05-01 11:22:37	abbyaha	thats a pretty sucky position to be in
2017-05-01 11:22:53	zekkin	unfortunately he's also my one link to the rest of my friend group and i'm not the type of person to try to turn someone against friends so i'm mostly isolated in this
2017-05-01 11:23:28	abbyaha	you could just do the whole "gray rock" thing, where you arent interesting but also not impolite towards him
2017-05-01 11:23:40	zekkin	that's essentially what i've been doing for a week or so
2017-05-01 11:23:59	zekkin	the problem with it is he sees himself as definitely not wrong
2017-05-01 11:24:19	abbyaha	yea thats not the type of person you need to be friends with
2017-05-01 11:24:29	zekkin	so if i don't interact i'm the bad guy because i'm ignoring him or something
2017-05-01 11:24:53	zekkin	that's sounding more and more true as time passes
2017-05-01 11:25:16	abbyaha	i mean, if youre feeling this way and have been for awhile, taking a long break from him  would be good
2017-05-01 11:25:23	abbyaha	then you can see if you missed talking to him
2017-05-01 11:25:27	zekkin	yeah i know
2017-05-01 11:25:38	na_th_an	abbyaha: this isn't /r/relationships
2017-05-01 11:25:57	abbyaha	lol i know
2017-05-01 11:26:05	zekkin	this is where things get complex though, we work together
2017-05-01 11:26:21	abbyaha	grey rock at work, nothing outside of work
2017-05-01 11:26:24	zekkin	it's a very shitty situation and i'm the only one at fault for putting myself there
2017-05-01 11:27:07	zekkin	anyway! enough of my complaining
2017-05-01 11:27:24	zekkin	i hope everyone is having a pleasant morning

2017-05-01 13:49:00	zekkin	and then this guy, the same guy as always, says "everything's gonna be alright dude"
2017-05-01 13:49:02	zekkin	so i told him to shut up

2017-05-01 13:53:48	zekkin	it's like he took serious offense to be told to shut up

2017-05-01 14:05:36	tr4656_	also is the reason for so much whitespace that you want to do height:100%?
2017-05-01 14:05:43	keveloper	k i do not know why when i load the page the scroller at the top is stupid
2017-05-01 14:06:15	keveloper	i just wanted the about section to take up the whole screen
2017-05-01 14:06:24	tr4656_	right
2017-05-01 14:06:43	keveloper	what do you not like
2017-05-01 14:06:44	tr4656_	Just know if someone views it full screen >1080p, it looks super silly
2017-05-01 14:07:19	keveloper	hmmmm
2017-05-01 14:07:43	SlabDabs	I mean, you could set it where if view size is over a height of 1080 it could use a different set of css rulings

2017-05-02 14:57:25	na_th_an	it takes like 22 mins to encode a 22 minute episode
2017-05-02 14:58:17	Roxas	do you prefer ripping to torrenting?
2017-05-02 14:58:48	na_th_an	sometimes the quality just isn't good enough
2017-05-02 14:58:51	na_th_an	esp for shows I really like

2017-05-02 14:59:01	na_th_an	I fucking love king of the hill
2017-05-02 14:59:07	na_th_an	the rips that are out there aren't that great for some seasons
2017-05-02 14:59:24	na_th_an	and seasons 8-11 didn't come out on dvd until recently
2017-05-02 14:59:30	na_th_an	so for those seasons there are only shitty tv rips
2017-05-02 14:59:34	na_th_an	with ads and stuff on em
2017-05-02 15:00:15	Roxas	that makes sense. ive had pretty decent luck with torrents but i havent done it much in the past 9-10 months
2017-05-02 15:00:38	na_th_an	yeah for the most part they're fine

2017-05-02 15:21:59	SlabDabs	noodler's flex are a VERY VERY VERY VERY firm flex, I pretty much couldn't get mine to flex (without mods) without damaging the paper
2017-05-02 15:22:15	SlabDabs	Not something I would suggest if you want more variation
2017-05-02 15:22:44	abbyaha	hmmm is there a different one you would recommend?

2017-05-02 15:24:49	abbyaha	wow those are gorgeous
2017-05-02 15:24:56	xveamvx	ikr
2017-05-02 15:25:25	xveamvx	I need more coffee
2017-05-02 15:27:16	SlabDabs	abbyaha: for flex it's a hard decision. you would get the MOST flex using a nib holder and dip nib like some zebra G's, but i'm not sure how well they work in a holder with fountain pen inks (thinner than caligraphy inks) otherwise to get a decent flex you're looking in the over $100 range for modern, or $40-60 for a vintage flex
2017-05-02 15:27:32	SlabDabs	some companies like Aurora have done some flex runs but they're $$$$$$$$$$$
2017-05-02 15:29:55	abbyaha	hmmm, i might go for a dip nib then, there is one ive been really liking the look of, and probably an oblique holder
2017-05-02 15:30:25	abbyaha	the hunt 513 nib looks awesome
2017-05-02 15:34:52	SlabDabs	yeah if you want to do flex then that would be a good way to go. You can also fit a zebra G nib in a JinHao x450 or x750, it's a little hackey and the ink flow isn't always the best
2017-05-02 15:35:14	SlabDabs	i haven't bothered with a dip pen since it's certainly not practical for any use aside from sitting down to do caligraphy
2017-05-02 15:35:47	abbyaha	well the hunt 513 and holder will be super cheap so i think im just going to go for that
2017-05-02 15:36:00	abbyaha	plus a few inks to try out
2017-05-02 15:36:10	SlabDabs	yeah
2017-05-02 15:36:14	abbyaha	plus probably another pen lolol
2017-05-02 15:36:16	SlabDabs	just making sure you know what to expect is all
2017-05-02 15:36:17	SlabDabs	haha

2017-05-02 15:38:27	abbyaha	thats....too much
2017-05-02 15:40:18	SlabDabs	yeah
2017-05-02 15:40:34	SlabDabs	when you start hitting the $200+ pens then it's just for dick waving
2017-05-02 15:41:41	abbyaha	as much as i love dick waving, i dont think ill be buying ANY pen for over $200 lol
2017-05-02 15:41:43	SlabDabs	there are a few in the $100-150 range I *might* get once I'm making more money, but I doubt I would go beyond that unless I'm rolling in Arij money
2017-05-02 15:42:08	SlabDabs	Sailor 1911 and Platinum 3776 mainly
2017-05-02 16:00:40	tr4656_	You should SlabDabs
2017-05-02 16:00:47	tr4656_	well, at least get your nib worked
2017-05-02 16:01:39	SlabDabs	if I get a custom grind on a pen at any point I would do it at a pen show so I could actually write with it infront of them
2017-05-02 16:01:39	tr4656_	idk. I think like a lot of higher end pens just feel/look very nice
2017-05-02 16:01:50	tr4656_	I agree
2017-05-02 16:01:58	tr4656_	do you plan to go ot any pen shows?
2017-05-02 16:02:24	SlabDabs	no direct plans, but I'll see what's going on around me once I move. I probably could drive up to the atlanta show next year
2017-05-02 16:02:36	tr4656_	Atlanta is pretty awesome
2017-05-02 16:02:39	abbyaha	there are pen shows?
2017-05-02 16:02:42	SlabDabs	there's at least once high end pen store in Orlando too
2017-05-02 16:02:42	tr4656_	I'm going to SF only this year

2017-05-02 22:22:51	abbyaha	yes
2017-05-02 22:22:55	switchy	they're so expensive
2017-05-02 22:22:56	xveamvx	yes
2017-05-02 22:23:00	xveamvx	but give it to me
2017-05-02 22:23:01	abbyaha	but your name is switchy
2017-05-02 22:23:01	xveamvx	thanks
2017-05-02 22:23:02	switchy	$470 + $90 for the switch + zelda combo
2017-05-02 22:23:10	xveamvx	ded
2017-05-02 22:23:16	xveamvx	should have bought it in murica
2017-05-02 22:23:30	switchy	xveamvx, how much is it there?
2017-05-02 22:23:35	xveamvx	$300
2017-05-02 22:23:43	xveamvx	but you can't find it anywhere
2017-05-02 22:23:56	xveamvx	You can get it on Gamestops website
2017-05-02 22:23:59	switchy	oh, wow
2017-05-02 22:24:00	switchy	that's way cheaper
2017-05-02 22:24:03	na_th_an	most people also buy a pro controller
2017-05-02 22:24:04	xveamvx	but you have to buy it with 3 games
2017-05-02 22:24:05	switchy	classic australia txa
2017-05-02 22:24:10	switchy	tax*
2017-05-02 22:24:10	slaytaner	no switchy
2017-05-02 22:24:13	na_th_an	then you also need zelda
2017-05-02 22:24:21	slaytaner	buy a ps4 and play persona 5
2017-05-02 22:24:26	xveamvx	or naw
2017-05-02 22:24:33	switchy	na_th_an, right, but $300 = $400 aud
2017-05-02 22:24:35	abbyaha	switchy: pay one of us to buy it and send it to you
2017-05-02 22:24:38	switchy	so the console itself is like 1 zelda cheaper
2017-05-02 22:24:45	xveamvx	abbyaha wut r u doin tonite

2017-05-02 22:25:41	switchy	abbyaha, not a terrible idea, but shipping a switch is probably expensive

2017-05-03 10:50:36	keveloper	na_th_an: he just thought that running shoes should cost that much
2017-05-03 10:50:46	na_th_an	a lot of them do
2017-05-03 10:50:47	keveloper	na_th_an: you can get could tennis shoes for $40
2017-05-03 10:50:55	keveloper	get good*
2017-05-03 10:50:58	abbyaha	but its nike
2017-05-03 10:50:59	na_th_an	they're not going to be as good
2017-05-03 10:51:09	keveloper	i got puma tennis shoes for like $29 on clearance
2017-05-03 10:51:20	keveloper	na_th_an: last years model/clearance/discount store
2017-05-03 10:51:25	keveloper	he went to a nike store
2017-05-03 10:51:32	keveloper	and bought like one of their highest priced tennis shoes
2017-05-03 10:51:33	na_th_an	you're doing the shoe equiv of "my membrane keyboard works fine and is $10"
2017-05-03 10:51:49	na_th_an	like quinton got a razer keyboard sure
2017-05-03 10:51:54	abbyaha	people just place different value limits on things
2017-05-03 10:51:57	na_th_an	but it's still better than a membrane
2017-05-03 10:52:03	keveloper	na_th_an: what
2017-05-03 10:52:03	keveloper	no
2017-05-03 10:52:06	na_th_an	keveloper: it's funny because he actually has a razer
2017-05-03 10:52:12	abbyaha	like i buy $60+ make up that you guys probs think is a waste
2017-05-03 10:52:19	keveloper	my point is that he spent $160 on shoes for marching band that he does like 2 weeks over the summer (percussion instructor)
2017-05-03 10:52:27	na_th_an	oh well that's dumb
2017-05-03 10:52:31	keveloper	and he doesn't care or know about shoes
2017-05-03 10:52:33	na_th_an	my qualifier was "if he needs them"
2017-05-03 10:52:39	zekkin	i spent ~250 on these margiela replicas
2017-05-03 10:52:40	na_th_an	if he was out marching all the time and needed good shoes
2017-05-03 10:52:42	keveloper	he just figured that was a fair price for some shoes that he'll wear 15 times
2017-05-03 10:52:44	abbyaha	oh yea then that is dumb
2017-05-03 10:52:44	zekkin	got them before i went to japan last winter

2017-05-03 13:48:03	SlabDabs	i wouldn't be so annoyed if my lease wasn't up in 28 days and I still need to figure out when and where to send all of my stuff. the house *should* have been closed already and mine if the seller and listing agent hadn't fucked this up so badly
2017-05-03 13:48:26	SlabDabs	I don't want to have to go to court and force them to hold to the contract =_=
2017-05-03 13:48:48	abbyaha	whaaaaat the fuck

2017-05-03 13:49:46	SlabDabs	I do have at least one other place I can move into, but I don't want to have to move twice or start sending my stuff there and then have this cleared up
2017-05-03 13:51:35	na_th_an	moving twice sucks
2017-05-03 13:51:42	na_th_an	last time I moved I had 12 days between leases
2017-05-03 13:52:03	SlabDabs	oof

2017-05-03 13:52:26	SlabDabs	this is a 1900 mile move....
2017-05-03 13:52:41	SlabDabs	so it's not like it's an inconvenience planning to move across town

2017-05-03 15:22:24	xveamvx	it's cute and people ask about it
2017-05-03 15:22:31	abbyaha	"cute"
2017-05-03 15:22:37	xveamvx	I would never buy one like this

2017-05-03 15:25:14	xveamvx	lol
2017-05-03 15:25:43	SlabDabs	abbyaha: the logo on mine disappears when you fire it and gives you all the volt/watt/amp info
2017-05-03 15:25:56	abbyaha	ya that looks useful
2017-05-03 15:26:02	abbyaha	xveamvx's doesnt lol
2017-05-03 15:26:12	xveamvx	Mine has all of that
2017-05-03 15:26:17	xveamvx	but at all times
2017-05-03 15:26:19	abbyaha	but why the background
2017-05-03 15:26:39	slaytaner	a vape that has a fleshlight on the end
2017-05-03 15:26:52	xveamvx	abbyaha I can't get the software to work
2017-05-03 15:27:00	xveamvx	so i can't change it to something custom
2017-05-03 15:27:12	xveamvx	It would be star wars if I could get it to work
2017-05-03 15:27:19	na_th_an	slaytaner: now that's an idea
2017-05-03 15:27:28	na_th_an	I could pretend I'm giving myself a blowjob and vape at the same time
2017-05-03 15:27:40	xveamvx	wow
2017-05-03 15:27:43	xveamvx	.i na_th_an

2017-05-03 15:27:49	na_th_an	you're just jelly
2017-05-03 15:28:24	xveamvx	na_th_an--
2017-05-03 15:28:24	magic_conch	na_th_an: +5/-1, 4
2017-05-03 15:28:29	na_th_an	:O
2017-05-03 15:29:22	abbyaha	lol
2017-05-03 15:29:25	abbyaha	but also, ew
2017-05-03 15:29:34	shrimp	hello
2017-05-03 15:29:46	abbyaha	sup shrimp
2017-05-03 15:29:46	na_th_an	hi
2017-05-03 15:29:55	slaytaner	combine a vape and a dildo
2017-05-03 15:30:19	shrimp	that sounds shitty
2017-05-03 15:30:28	SlabDabs	i made the dickbutt wallpaper for my vape lol
2017-05-03 15:30:33	SlabDabs	only person who has it ;D
2017-05-03 15:31:01	na_th_an	I definitely see less value in a dildo/vape than a fleshlight/vape
2017-05-03 15:31:13	na_th_an	I think the fleshlight and vape markets overlap more than the dildo and vape markets
2017-05-03 15:31:26	na_th_an	can we do some market research on this?
2017-05-03 15:31:52	zekkin	shrimp--
2017-05-03 15:31:52	magic_conch	shrimp: +0/-1, -1
2017-05-03 15:32:01	SlabDabs	dildo vape is only cool if you can get the tip to billow out smoke
2017-05-03 15:32:04	shrimp	rude af
2017-05-03 15:32:17	slaytaner	well yeah
2017-05-03 15:32:20	slaytaner	no
2017-05-03 15:32:21	shrimp	zekkin: dildo vape or fleshlight vape
2017-05-03 15:32:38	slaytaner	you inhale through the tip
2017-05-03 15:32:47	zekkin	how does the fleshlight work
2017-05-03 15:33:02	zekkin	dildo vape makes the most sense
2017-05-03 15:33:07	shrimp	Inhale through the vagina
2017-05-03 15:33:12	slaytaner	you inhale through the clit
2017-05-03 15:33:18	na_th_an	slaytaner: I feel like inhaling through the tip would cause issues when using the dildo in a low-pressure vacuum environment
2017-05-03 15:33:40	shrimp	It's like cunninlingus and vaping at the same time
2017-05-03 15:33:56	na_th_an	I know you can absorb alcohol through the vagina
2017-05-03 15:33:59	na_th_an	but idk about vaping
2017-05-03 15:35:05	slaytaner	you press a button on the balls to seal it
2017-05-03 15:35:27	na_th_an	lol
2017-05-03 15:36:09	zekkin	buttchugs amirite
2017-05-03 15:37:53	na_th_an	if you wanna die maybe
2017-05-03 15:37:59	na_th_an	don't give xveamvx ideas
2017-05-03 15:38:07	na_th_an	he's still young and impressionable
2017-05-03 15:39:32	slaytaner	also the dil-vape is 15"
2017-05-03 15:43:18	na_th_an	length or circumference
2017-05-03 15:43:40	abbyaha	>:O
2017-05-03 15:44:25	na_th_an	that's only 4.8 inches diameter nbd

2017-05-03 15:56:58	na_th_an	I could email him back and ask about it
2017-05-03 15:57:14	na_th_an	but I doubt he's going to refund me anything, I'm probably not going to cancel and reorder
2017-05-03 15:57:33	na_th_an	so I'm not sure what it'd accomplish

2017-05-03 16:51:06	SlabDabs	it's more about memorizing meta
2017-05-03 16:54:11	switchy	I heard some people the other day saying sc1 was better in that regard
2017-05-03 16:55:37	slaytaner	apparently koreans are still all about brood war

2017-05-03 16:58:40	slaytaner	sc2 is a white people game
2017-05-03 16:58:53	na_th_an	sc1 is definitely a better game than sc2

2017-05-04 14:21:39	SlabDabs	bleh I don't want to work
2017-05-04 14:22:11	na_th_an	do you ever
2017-05-04 14:22:30	SlabDabs	no. This job is life draining, only a few days left though
2017-05-04 14:22:48	na_th_an	you're moving right
2017-05-04 14:22:57	SlabDabs	yeah
2017-05-04 14:23:07	SlabDabs	i was going to leave this job anyways
2017-05-04 14:23:21	SlabDabs	but then just stayed until I moved instead of trying to get a new job for 3 months
2017-05-04 14:23:23	na_th_an	do you have another job lined up?
2017-05-04 14:23:26	SlabDabs	yeah
2017-05-04 14:23:28	na_th_an	word
2017-05-04 14:23:33	na_th_an	that's gotta feel good

2017-05-04 14:23:38	na_th_an	but also make you not want to work
2017-05-04 14:23:48	SlabDabs	it will be good once I get everything moved and taken care of
2017-05-04 14:24:16	SlabDabs	still resolving legal bullshit with the contract on my house. I should heard from my lawyer today though, he has a phone meeting with the seller's lawyer right now
2017-05-04 14:24:30	SlabDabs	once that is taken care of then I'll feel a lot better about all of this
2017-05-04 14:24:54	na_th_an	finding a rental is bad enough, finding a house must suck total ass
2017-05-04 14:25:16	SlabDabs	well the contract should have already been closed by now, but the seller fucked up on his end
2017-05-04 14:25:28	SlabDabs	so it's a shit storm of figuring out occupancy while it's in legal probate
2017-05-04 14:25:33	slaytaner	you just have to have loads of cash, then finding a house is EZ
2017-05-04 14:25:49	SlabDabs	I have somewhere I could move, but I don't want to have to move twice or pay rent instead of a mortgage
2017-05-04 14:26:39	arij	How can I tell my friend that I don't want to loan him 5 bitcoins

2017-05-04 14:27:26	arij	He wants to trade with it but I feel like when I ask for it back and he's at a loss or something then he'll get all upset
2017-05-04 14:27:41	arij	He wants to buy an altcoin that he thinks is going to go up
2017-05-04 14:27:42	na_th_an	he wants to trade with it and needs it as a loan?

2017-05-04 14:30:19	na_th_an	unless you have a spare $8k to give away
2017-05-04 14:30:23	na_th_an	in which case
2017-05-04 14:30:24	SlabDabs	that's not something to risk
2017-05-04 14:30:26	na_th_an	hi it's me your friend
2017-05-04 14:30:32	Roxas	id tell him id rather not bring any kind of finances into the friendship

2017-05-04 14:31:13	Roxas	^
2017-05-04 14:31:13	na_th_an	$8k could pay off my car with 2k left over

2017-05-04 16:28:27	SlabDabs	though I guess my 4th nice one is there now too
2017-05-04 16:28:50	na_th_an	do you keep them all hooked up and right next to each other tho
2017-05-04 16:29:48	slaytaner	hi switchy
2017-05-04 16:30:07	SlabDabs	mostly
2017-05-04 16:30:08	slaytaner	rip timmac playing not gtav xveamvx
2017-05-04 16:30:14	SlabDabs	at least my mx518 and one of my evoluents
2017-05-04 16:30:52	arij	switchy: im looking for some one to write a firmware for the split65 - i can pay you upfront if you're up for it
2017-05-04 16:31:26	SlabDabs	wish i knew more about custom firmwares lol
2017-05-04 16:31:28	arij	or slaytaner if you know how to do that? you mentioned you wanted to make some moneyy
2017-05-04 16:31:41	na_th_an	I know how to do that for handwired builds with qmk
2017-05-04 16:31:52	arij	its the same thing the wires are just on the pcb
2017-05-04 16:32:05	na_th_an	SlabDabs: I feel that. I wanna learn more about qmk but I don't know C very well
2017-05-04 16:32:05	arij	but yyou have to deal with a multiplexer and IO extender
2017-05-04 16:32:14	na_th_an	ah yeah that's on my to-learn list
2017-05-04 16:32:37	SlabDabs	ugh C
2017-05-04 16:32:41	SlabDabs	i took a C++ course
2017-05-04 16:32:45	SlabDabs	I don't like coding
2017-05-04 16:32:55	na_th_an	I do
2017-05-04 16:32:57	abbyaha	C is v fun
2017-05-04 16:32:59	na_th_an	which is good bc it pays bills
2017-05-04 16:33:08	slaytaner	C is alright
2017-05-04 16:33:12	SlabDabs	i'm a graphics man
2017-05-04 16:33:12	na_th_an	abbyaha: sorta............ sometimes..............
2017-05-04 16:33:32	abbyaha	lol i always have fun with it
2017-05-04 16:33:35	abbyaha	even when its dumb
2017-05-04 16:33:43	na_th_an	you haven't gotten into "real" C before
2017-05-04 16:33:43	slaytaner	idk why people have so many problems with pointers
2017-05-04 16:33:45	na_th_an	macro magic
2017-05-04 16:33:45	abbyaha	first language i learned so i have a soft spot
2017-05-04 16:33:59	SlabDabs	"oh, you have a comma out of place? enjoy me not compiling huehuehuehue"
2017-05-04 16:34:05	na_th_an	when I look at "real" C projects it looks nothing like the C I can write
2017-05-04 16:34:12	abbyaha	oh true na_th_an
2017-05-04 16:34:13	na_th_an	they are truly wizards
2017-05-04 16:34:28	xveamvx	who does electronic stuff?
2017-05-04 16:34:30	na_th_an	then I go into qmk and I'm like "how do I get my visualzer working"
2017-05-04 16:34:47	xveamvx	like calculating maximum voltage through a 390 ohm 1/2 watt resistor
2017-05-04 16:35:03	slaytaner	xveamvx tuxfux on mechboards
2017-05-04 16:35:17	SlabDabs	i did before I noped out of my EE degree haha
2017-05-04 16:35:58	slaytaner	int *switchy
2017-05-04 16:36:46	na_th_an	slaytaner: btw, regarding pointers, some people have a lot of trouble with the idea of variables
2017-05-04 16:37:05	na_th_an	I can't comprehend THAT
2017-05-04 16:37:10	na_th_an	at least pointers are a little more abstract
2017-05-04 16:40:21	slaytaner	also assembly isn't terribly difficult either
2017-05-04 16:40:35	slaytaner	just a massive pain in the dick to write
2017-05-04 16:40:37	arij	slaytaner: so do you want to do that?
2017-05-04 16:40:56	keveloper	slaytaner: the idea of assembly and being able to understand how it works i think isn't hard
2017-05-04 16:41:11	keveloper	or being able to read it and think 'okay they are storing this value in this register then loading htis value' is easy
2017-05-04 16:41:14	na_th_an	assembly is simple
2017-05-04 16:41:17	keveloper	but to actually write something with it that is useful
2017-05-04 16:41:28	keveloper	like, RCT lol
2017-05-04 16:41:32	slaytaner	hence the massive pain in the dick
2017-05-04 16:41:35	na_th_an	that's why we have 100 layers of abstraction
2017-05-04 16:41:57	na_th_an	where's that guy that thinks you should write CRUD apps in C
2017-05-04 16:42:00	na_th_an	why doesn't he use asm
2017-05-04 16:42:04	na_th_an	it'd be faster
2017-05-04 16:42:18	keveloper	na_th_an: you mean quinton's co worker?
2017-05-04 16:42:25	slaytaner	just write everything in x86 mov
2017-05-04 16:42:31	na_th_an	keveloper: oh yeah. I coudn't remember who it was
2017-05-04 16:42:38	keveloper	'if you use a framework or library you arent a real programmer'
2017-05-04 16:42:40	na_th_an	slaytaner: the guy that wrote that was actually a prof of mine at OSU
2017-05-04 16:42:41	keveloper	i think was the quote
2017-05-04 16:42:47	na_th_an	far and away the best prof I ever had there
2017-05-04 16:42:59	na_th_an	he taught me the basics of C which I already knew :( such a waste
2017-05-04 16:43:09	 *	na_th_an is bitter
2017-05-04 16:43:11	slaytaner	I need to figure out how to give a shit about programming again
2017-05-04 16:43:13	switchy	arij: sure
2017-05-04 16:43:27	slaytaner	or really anything at this point
2017-05-04 16:43:34	na_th_an	I know that feel
2017-05-04 16:43:35	keveloper	"high level languages are for people who don't understand computer science"
2017-05-04 16:43:39	arij	switchy: multiplexer and IO extender
2017-05-04 16:43:42	keveloper	na_th_an: thats what it was
2017-05-04 16:43:47	arij	do you think you can figure that part out?
2017-05-04 16:43:53	na_th_an	keveloper: idk how people like that are employed
2017-05-04 16:43:58	keveloper	and also "anyone who use spring and other mvc framework isn't doing 'real' programming"
2017-05-04 16:44:05	arij	switchy: do you want paypal or bitcoin
2017-05-04 16:44:06	switchy	arij: sure
2017-05-04 16:44:16	na_th_an	switchy: teach me how
2017-05-04 16:44:19	switchy	paypal
2017-05-04 16:44:30	arij	switchy: any idea how much $ you want?
2017-05-04 16:44:45	arij	i was thinking $50 to start - and after $50 worth of work - if it takes more work I can send more
2017-05-04 16:44:53	switchy	sure
2017-05-04 16:44:57	keveloper	whats goin on who you hiring
2017-05-04 16:45:10	arij	hiring switchy to write qmk firmware for split65
2017-05-04 16:45:22	slaytaner	I also need to l2database
2017-05-04 16:45:23	arij	switchy: when can you get started?
2017-05-04 16:45:24	keveloper	$50 to do what exactly
2017-05-04 16:45:31	keveloper	switchy: like how long is that gonna take
2017-05-04 16:45:32	switchy	arij: this afternoon

2017-05-04 16:53:33	keveloper	5) learn sql
2017-05-04 16:55:07	slaytaner	are there any good books on this stuff

2017-05-04 16:58:50	abbyaha	i mean, probably, but its so much better to actually DO something than read about it
2017-05-04 16:58:56	abbyaha	plus books get outdated
2017-05-04 16:59:38	abbyaha	this is probably fine though if youre set on it: https://www.amazon.com/SQL-Cookbook-Solutions-Techniques-Developers/dp/0596009763

2017-05-04 17:12:19	arij	think i found it
2017-05-04 17:12:21	arij	long leg is square
2017-05-04 17:18:13	switchy	that probably sounds right? the long leg is positive
2017-05-04 17:18:25	switchy	there's no set convention for when to use a circular or square pad though
2017-05-04 17:18:26	SlabDabs	is it next friday yet? so over.... well I was going to say this job, but it's this boss

2017-05-04 17:30:53	slaytaner	I think the barbacoa is alright
2017-05-04 17:31:41	SlabDabs	overall I'm heavily disappointed in chipotle, you get a large volume of food at a reasonable rate, but to me nearly all of it has way less flavor than anything remotely mexican *should* have. It's totally just mexican starbucks
2017-05-04 17:31:58	SlabDabs	I'd rather go to taco bell instead of chipotle to be honest
2017-05-04 17:32:37	switchy	the real truth comes out
2017-05-04 17:32:41	abbyaha	i like chipotle for what it is, americanized 'mexican' food

2017-05-04 18:18:50	arij	not a huge fan of the wingsung
2017-05-04 18:19:02	arij	maybe i treated mine poorly but it broke after like the 2nd or 3d ink change
2017-05-04 18:19:24	arij	the piston wouldnt mmove up and down as it was supposed to, had to basically dismantle it to fill it
2017-05-04 18:20:08	arij	twsbi tho - i love em - even tho i cracked the barrel their customer support is good/quick/
2017-05-04 18:20:49	SlabDabs	yeah arij you fucked it up
2017-05-04 18:21:02	SlabDabs	my WS piston is smoother than my Eco's for sure
2017-05-04 18:21:15	arij	diamond piston better than ws imo
2017-05-04 18:21:28	SlabDabs	nice
2017-05-04 18:21:31	arij	although i did like the locking mechanism tghat the WS had
2017-05-04 18:21:40	SlabDabs	though if you broke yours and didn't seat it right then how would you know haha
2017-05-04 18:21:47	SlabDabs	oh totally, the end cap on the WS is much better
2017-05-04 18:21:56	SlabDabs	don't have to put the piston all the way down or worry about unscrewing it
2017-05-04 18:22:45	arij	oh i ordered a bottle of fire and ice this morning

2017-05-04 19:49:40	switchy	slaytaner, it's alright, I decided to just submit separate jobs instead of trying to combine everything
2017-05-04 19:49:58	switchy	the cray mpi system in the us was pretty smart about scheduling multiple jobs
2017-05-04 19:50:12	switchy	but openmpi here will just bind them all without regard to the others
2017-05-04 19:50:40	switchy	so yay, more shell scripts to submit like 20 jobs at once
2017-05-04 19:50:42	switchy	which really isn't that many

2017-05-04 20:24:45	SlabDabs	i played LoL through season 1 finals and was over it
2017-05-04 20:24:52	xveamvx	I think I installed Dota 2 once on a laptop to see how well it performed for someone whowanted to buy it
2017-05-04 20:24:59	SlabDabs	shittier community, more meta of gameplay (which i'm too casual to bother with)
2017-05-04 20:25:04	SlabDabs	in lol

2017-05-04 20:28:05	xveamvx	slaytaner do you have a clip of the failure to rp bs?
2017-05-04 20:29:06	slaytaner	I mean basically they were racing in the subway and it was either fail rp for doing that or respawning before the cops got there (I've never seen them find anyone underground)
2017-05-04 20:29:32	xveamvx	fuck that guy
2017-05-04 20:39:59	SlabDabs	lol arij someone in the slack is selling a vac mini 1.1 with a crack in the blind cap, i'm asking for pictures

2017-05-04 20:58:08	arij	SlabDabs:
2017-05-04 20:58:22	SlabDabs	$40 shipped
2017-05-04 20:58:47	arij	What's a blind cap
2017-05-04 20:58:52	SlabDabs	the blind cap is the back unscrewing cap that holds the piston mechanism
2017-05-04 20:59:22	SlabDabs	https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/vew8wRtj/image_uploaded_from_ios.jpg
2017-05-04 20:59:22	arij	Duuuude
2017-05-04 20:59:23	SlabDabs	you can barely see the crack above the metal band
2017-05-04 20:59:29	arij	My blind cap had ink in it
2017-05-04 20:59:48	arij	That's why I tried to tighten it
2017-05-04 20:59:52	arij	Then snapped the barrel
2017-05-04 21:00:11	switchy	o.o
2017-05-04 21:00:13	SlabDabs	hah yeah with most of them you have to be careful
2017-05-04 21:00:15	switchy	that doesn't sound ideal
2017-05-04 21:00:22	arij	Why did mine have ink in it
2017-05-04 21:00:29	SlabDabs	supposedly their plastic is under some decent stress because of their molding process
2017-05-04 21:00:31	SlabDabs	no idea on the ink
2017-05-04 21:00:46	SlabDabs	i haven't even handled one, maybe not a totally tight seal around the piston? ink on hands?
2017-05-04 21:00:46	arij	Dude
2017-05-04 21:00:56	arij	Mine is silver where yours is black
2017-05-04 21:00:59	arij	Did I get a fake
2017-05-04 21:02:01	arij	Maybe I need to lube it
2017-05-04 21:02:12	SlabDabs	where did you order from?
2017-05-04 21:02:19	arij	Amazon
2017-05-04 21:02:25	arij	Said twsbi was the seller
2017-05-04 21:02:40	arij	Can you ask some one in the chat
2017-05-04 21:02:43	arij	Pretty please
2017-05-04 21:02:54	SlabDabs	hmm, i really doubt it would be fake. i've heard more stories about fake lamy safari's
2017-05-04 21:03:02	SlabDabs	take a picture of what you're talking about
2017-05-04 21:03:14	SlabDabs	also did you order a "clear" one? or?
2017-05-04 21:03:20	arij	Maybe?
2017-05-04 21:03:28	arij	If the clear ones have silver parts instead of black
2017-05-04 21:03:31	arij	Then ya
2017-05-04 21:03:52	arij	But I always see black ones on YouTube

2017-05-04 21:17:31	switchy	I wonder if these fifo underruns in dmesg are related
2017-05-04 21:17:39	slaytaner	rip switchy
2017-05-04 21:17:57	slaytaner	have you tried turning it off and on again
2017-05-04 21:19:06	slaytaner	and unplugging it
2017-05-04 21:19:22	switchy	hmm, not fifo underruns, just happened again and nothing in dmesg
2017-05-04 21:19:42	switchy	slaytaner, sometimes it happens more than other times
2017-05-04 21:19:47	switchy	it's been going on for a while
2017-05-04 21:20:16	slaytaner	is the monitor itself turning off
2017-05-04 21:21:14	slaytaner	or is it software switchy
2017-05-04 21:22:49	switchy	slaytaner, I don't think the monitor is turning *off*, but it goes black
2017-05-04 21:23:30	switchy	I don't think it's software either

2017-05-04 21:25:33	switchy	slaytaner, done, we'll see if it keeps happening
2017-05-04 21:25:39	switchy	the monitor itself is also pretty warm
2017-05-04 21:25:48	switchy	I wonder if there are ever thermal things with them?
2017-05-04 21:26:13	switchy	heh, just happened again
2017-05-04 21:28:35	slaytaner	maybe it's dying
2017-05-04 21:29:02	switchy	yeah maybe
2017-05-04 21:29:22	switchy	it's just some generic dell monitor
2017-05-04 21:29:26	switchy	we have billions of them
2017-05-04 21:31:39	slaytaner	best thing for a dead monitor is lead projectiles flying through them at high velocity

2017-05-07 13:40:28	SlabDabs	pilot 78G BB Stub came in, 1.1 TWSBI Vac Mini is on schedule to arrive tomorrow lol
2017-05-07 13:40:35	SlabDabs	i keep looking at the platinum 3776 on amazon....
2017-05-07 13:44:23	slaytaner	gonna get the uef SlabDabs
2017-05-07 13:47:31	arij	SlabDabs: what do you think about montblanc m fountain pen
2017-05-07 13:48:16	SlabDabs	ANY montblanc pen is not worth the price if you're looking to buy things
2017-05-07 13:48:32	SlabDabs	they are *only* used as status images and compare with pens half their price or under
2017-05-07 13:48:48	slaytaner	they're like the rolex of fountain pens
2017-05-07 13:53:15	arij	whaaat
2017-05-07 13:53:47	arij	youre tellin me that my twsbi is just as good as that mb
2017-05-07 13:54:24	slaytaner	they're good, just overpriced
2017-05-07 13:54:42	arij	 i think its $550-$750
2017-05-07 13:54:44	arij	i forget which one
2017-05-07 13:55:29	SlabDabs	arij: a MB probably has a little nicer feed a nib, comparable to like a sailor 1911 ($125 on amazon). but if you want a $500 pen that is worth $500 look at like Visconti, Pelikan, Aurora
2017-05-07 13:56:01	SlabDabs	and i think the MB M was like $250 on amazon compared to twice that on their website

2017-05-07 13:57:10	arij	if i was spending 500 id want it to be a mb

2017-05-07 13:57:56	SlabDabs	well if you want something that impresses other people who know pens, visconti is more like it
2017-05-07 13:58:12	SlabDabs	if you want to impress corporate hacks who are 60 years old, then get a MB
2017-05-07 13:58:23	SlabDabs	but a visconti would still leave a much bigger impression and be a MUCH better pen
2017-05-07 13:58:25	arij	its just for my self
2017-05-07 13:58:29	arij	no one would see it
2017-05-07 13:58:33	SlabDabs	then get a better pen

2017-05-08 10:54:40	arij	zekkin: they emailed you?
2017-05-08 10:54:57	zekkin	i got an invoice for it
2017-05-08 10:55:03	zekkin	and i paid it
2017-05-08 10:55:11	arij	I didn't get any invoices yet
2017-05-08 10:55:17	zekkin	that means you didn't win
2017-05-08 10:55:19	zekkin	lol
2017-05-08 10:55:25	abbyaha	arij: thats as tiny as i can write, i know you were wondering how small one could write with the stub
2017-05-08 10:55:29	zekkin	you MIGHT get one if someone doesn't pay their invoice
2017-05-08 10:56:34	arij	Probably better that I didn't get one

2017-05-08 11:06:30	arij	oh
2017-05-08 11:06:32	zekkin	selling for large profit is probably not

2017-05-08 17:02:26	keveloper	with redbull
2017-05-08 17:02:34	na_th_an	good idea
2017-05-08 17:03:23	switchy	cooked with water and a dash of salt, splash of milk on top when you serve it, usually with some jam or a grated apple or something
2017-05-08 17:03:44	slaytaner	I make mine with whiskey
2017-05-08 17:04:39	na_th_an	hmm jam is a good idea
2017-05-08 17:04:48	na_th_an	I always just do brown sugar and cinnamon
2017-05-08 17:05:01	switchy	yeah, the classic

2017-05-08 17:05:15	switchy	banana and brown sugar is good too
2017-05-08 17:06:18	na_th_an	my oatmeal game needs to improve
2017-05-08 17:06:32	slaytaner	maple syrup
2017-05-08 17:06:42	switchy	maple syrup is good too
2017-05-08 17:06:59	switchy	step 1: stop calling it oatmeal, step 2: use a spurtle
2017-05-08 17:07:01	switchy	bam
2017-05-08 17:07:03	switchy	you are god tier

2017-05-08 18:24:45	arij	what do they control? they control the gears
2017-05-08 18:24:48	abbyaha	is there a top speed they can go?
2017-05-08 18:24:55	arij	unlimited plus 1
2017-05-08 18:24:59	arij	infinity plus 2
2017-05-08 18:25:16	slaytaner	are you for real
2017-05-08 18:25:17	abbyaha	you are no help
2017-05-08 18:25:21	slaytaner	what do gears do
2017-05-08 18:25:27	slaytaner	.w gears
2017-05-08 18:25:27	magic_conch	"A gear or cogwheel is a rotating machine part having cut teeth, or cogs, which mesh with another toothed part to transmit torque." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gears
2017-05-08 18:25:34	arij	can you even drive a manual trans car
2017-05-08 18:25:48	arij	some gears are bigger than others
2017-05-08 18:25:51	abbyaha	k i know what gears in simple machines do and up, just not what they do for cars
2017-05-08 18:25:54	arij	and transmit more torque
2017-05-08 18:25:59	arij	ie higher gear to go faster
2017-05-08 18:26:41	slaytaner	they let you transmit more torque at lower rpms
2017-05-08 18:26:41	arij	id teach you how to drive but youd probably destroy my truck
2017-05-08 18:27:06	abbyaha	also you are in CT
2017-05-08 18:27:12	arij	oh yea and that
2017-05-08 18:27:22	arij	didnt you visit yale onxe
2017-05-08 18:27:24	arij	once
2017-05-08 18:27:34	arij	we were 15 min away from each other most likely
2017-05-08 18:27:40	arij	at one point in our lives
2017-05-08 18:27:55	arij	brb
2017-05-08 18:27:57	abbyaha	i visited yale back in 2011
2017-05-08 18:28:10	arij	oh thats when i was living in nyc
2017-05-08 18:30:35	slaytaner	arij how do you not know how to ride a bike
2017-05-08 18:30:41	slaytaner	abbyaha*
2017-05-08 18:31:07	abbyaha	idk my parents stopped teaching me because i was a lil baby bitch about it
2017-05-08 18:31:11	abbyaha	too anxious as a kid
2017-05-08 18:33:15	slaytaner	rip abbyaha
2017-05-08 18:35:16	slaytaner	you should learn to ride a bike
2017-05-08 18:35:22	slaytaner	it's not too difficult
2017-05-08 18:35:46	abbyaha	thats what everyone says
2017-05-08 18:35:54	abbyaha	every bf i have ever had has tried to teach me
2017-05-08 18:37:22	slaytaner	how'd that go?
2017-05-08 18:38:08	abbyaha	i still cant ride and they are all exes lol
2017-05-08 18:38:26	abbyaha	except for my current bf who hasnt tried to teach me, obv
2017-05-08 18:39:17	slaytaner	my method would be training wheels -> ride or die
2017-05-08 18:46:36	arij	i would just put you on the bike and push you down a hill
2017-05-08 18:46:40	arij	GL
2017-05-08 18:47:23	abbyaha	lol no thanks to either of those
2017-05-08 18:48:37	slaytaner	training wheels are fine
2017-05-08 18:49:02	slaytaner	then I take them off and make you go down the biggest hill I can find
2017-05-08 18:49:34	slaytaner	hopefully on a trail
2017-05-08 19:00:15	slaytaner	rip switchy
2017-05-08 19:07:15	switchy	abbyaha, you can't ride a bike?!
2017-05-08 19:07:20	switchy	whaaaaaaaat
2017-05-08 19:07:22	switchy	slaytaner, hi
2017-05-08 19:07:24	abbyaha	lol i cant
2017-05-08 19:07:33	switchy	that is amazing
2017-05-08 19:07:44	slaytaner	abbyaha is a deficient human bean
2017-05-08 19:07:55	abbyaha	probs true
2017-05-08 19:08:11	slaytaner	switchy how would you teach someone to ride a bike
2017-05-08 19:08:53	switchy	that's a good question
2017-05-08 19:09:28	slaytaner	I'd do training wheels for a while then go full ride or die
2017-05-08 19:09:41	switchy	I don't think I'd even do training wheels
2017-05-08 19:10:01	slaytaner	just ride or die?
2017-05-08 19:10:03	switchy	just a low enough seat that you can feet on the ground, try to roll forward a little bit
2017-05-08 19:10:09	switchy	get used to the balance
2017-05-08 19:10:18	switchy	then have somebody push you, no pedalling
2017-05-08 19:10:21	switchy	then advance to pedalling
2017-05-08 19:10:40	switchy	similar to what we did when learning to ride motorcycles
2017-05-08 19:11:31	slaytaner	I think shifting would be a pain to learn on a motorbike
2017-05-08 19:13:03	<--	shrimp (~shrimp@unaffiliated/shrimp) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2017-05-08 19:13:50	switchy	it's not that hard
2017-05-08 19:14:05	switchy	they just get you to ride in a straight line in first for a while to get used to it
2017-05-08 19:14:09	switchy	then ride in a straight line and shift to second
2017-05-08 19:14:30	switchy	and then ride in a circle with shifting/braking zones
2017-05-08 19:15:28	arij	shifting on a motorcycle is ez
2017-05-08 19:15:34	slaytaner	slaytaners hayabusa motorcycle school
2017-05-08 19:15:38	arij	i literally learned by getting on a bike and shifting
2017-05-08 19:15:43	arij	on a motorcycle*
2017-05-08 19:16:04	arij	i guess it helps to understand how a manual transmission works
2017-05-08 19:16:18	slaytaner	I'm real bad at clutching
2017-05-08 19:16:29	arij	like pushing the clutch down>
2017-05-08 19:16:35	arij	how can you be bad at that
2017-05-08 19:16:38	switchy	haha
2017-05-08 19:16:41	arij	step 1 take foot
2017-05-08 19:16:44	arij	step 2 push down
2017-05-08 19:16:51	arij	step 3 ???
2017-05-08 19:16:53	switchy	slaytaner, just practice, I used to be so terrible
2017-05-08 19:16:57	arij	step 4 $$$
2017-05-08 19:17:08	slaytaner	I get fucked on inclines
2017-05-08 19:17:15	switchy	more accelerator
2017-05-08 19:17:17	arij	inclines are my favorite
2017-05-08 19:17:22	switchy	redline and dump
2017-05-08 19:17:25	switchy	problem solved
2017-05-08 19:17:26	arij	burnin that rubber all dau
2017-05-08 19:17:56	switchy	but yeah, they can be stressful. especially when you stop and have a bunch of time to think about it
2017-05-08 19:18:02	slaytaner	so it's like clutch -> shift to first -> accel -> release clutch -> stall
2017-05-08 19:18:05	-->	shrimp (~AndChat30@unaffiliated/shrimp) has joined #beyblades
2017-05-08 19:18:11	arij	LOLLLLLLLLL
2017-05-08 19:18:14	switchy	accelerate more
2017-05-08 19:18:35	switchy	and with practice you'll be able to feel the clutch better and prevent stalls
2017-05-08 19:18:38	arij	dude u can probably clutch, put into first, very slowly let go of clutch with no gas
2017-05-08 19:18:40	switchy	feel it lugging and push it in a bit more
2017-05-08 19:18:44	arij	and youll start to roll in 1st
2017-05-08 19:18:51	switchy	arij, probably not on a hill, because you'll be rolling backwards at that point
2017-05-08 19:18:55	arij	oh right, hill
2017-05-08 19:19:01	arij	damn hills
2017-05-08 19:19:24	switchy	but on a hill you can have foot on the brake, release clutch until you feel it bite, then switch to accelerator
2017-05-08 19:19:33	switchy	if you don't want to do a regular hill start
2017-05-08 19:19:38	switchy	which I never do
2017-05-08 19:19:57	arij	idunno it comes naturally to me at this point, i dont think about it, sort of like breathing. although i do forget to breathe some times
2017-05-08 19:20:24	switchy	yeah
2017-05-08 19:20:28	switchy	you've just gotta do it
2017-05-08 19:20:39	slaytaner	I need a junker
2017-05-08 19:20:39	switchy	and then you'll be able to do it
2017-05-08 19:20:44	arij	slaytaner: my truck
2017-05-08 19:20:46	arij	so forgiving
2017-05-08 19:21:05	switchy	a truck or a shitty little car
2017-05-08 19:21:05	arij	but if you stall it out more than 3 times it wont start for an hour or so
2017-05-08 19:21:14	switchy	shitty little cars are surprisingly forgiving too
2017-05-08 19:21:19	switchy	but they also don't exist in the us
2017-05-08 19:21:32	switchy	we have heaps of tiny cheap manual japanese hatches
2017-05-08 19:21:53	slaytaner	we just got fiats not too long ago
2017-05-08 19:21:56	slaytaner	and only the 500
2017-05-08 19:21:59	switchy	fix it again, tony
2017-05-08 19:22:02	switchy	huehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehue
2017-05-08 19:22:25	switchy	I don't like the new 500 much
2017-05-08 19:22:52	switchy	slaytaner, have you got ford fiestas?
2017-05-08 19:23:07	slaytaner	yup

2017-05-08 19:26:42	switchy	was sold as a kia with a mazda engine
2017-05-08 19:26:57	switchy	slaytaner, that's probably a bit too old ;)
2017-05-08 19:28:14	switchy	slaytaner, yaris?
2017-05-08 19:29:25	slaytaner	anyway I can't afford one so it doesn't matter
2017-05-08 19:29:58	switchy	just steal one
2017-05-08 19:30:01	switchy	that'll be a good way to learn
2017-05-08 19:30:17	switchy	just don't granny shift while you're running from the cops

2017-05-08 20:06:19	arij	i lubed that part earlier so it doesnt happen again
2017-05-08 20:06:37	arij	its probably the inside of that metal part tho
2017-05-08 20:06:41	arij	so my lube was probs useless

2017-05-08 21:01:39	switchy	slaytaner, I think I'll wait until I'm further in zelda to get mk8

2017-05-08 21:24:16	arij	SlabDabs: what am i looking at
2017-05-08 21:24:20	arij	mini on left?
2017-05-08 21:24:26	SlabDabs	yeah
2017-05-08 21:24:38	arij	doesnt look as wide as the other one
2017-05-08 21:24:41	arij	maybe its broad?
2017-05-08 21:24:46	arij	but it says 1.1
2017-05-08 21:24:52	SlabDabs	i think it's mostly the angle, but it doesn't put down as thick of a line
2017-05-08 21:25:03	arij	strange
2017-05-08 21:25:51	SlabDabs	could be an older production, the feed, worn in different, the ink
2017-05-08 21:26:09	SlabDabs	maybe once the feed saturates it could put down heavier, and it does a little with some pressure
2017-05-08 21:26:23	SlabDabs	though the finer stub would work better for normal work
2017-05-08 21:27:29	slaytaner	blaze it 1.1
2017-05-08 21:31:05	arij	do you like the vac mini tho
2017-05-08 21:31:09	arij	i like the filling system
2017-05-08 21:31:19	arij	you gotta fill it then flip it upside down and push the air out
2017-05-08 21:31:24	arij	then fill it again to get a full fill

2017-05-09 13:38:45	slaytaner	you'd do it with milk
2017-05-09 13:39:08	na_th_an	coconut oil is a solid at room temp

2017-05-09 13:39:43	arij	i add both
2017-05-09 13:39:43	na_th_an	solids != liquids
2017-05-09 13:39:46	slaytaner	that's why you rub it all over yourself before putting it in the smoothie
2017-05-09 13:40:36	abbyaha	i know na_th_an lol, but almond milk provides the fat so i wasnt sure if arij used it in place of that
2017-05-09 13:40:44	arij	oh idunno

2017-05-09 17:59:05	slaytaner	arij you should look at euro pens

2017-05-09 18:01:59	slaytaner	yeah euro pens are ususally broader
2017-05-09 18:03:09	SlabDabs	Yeah, jap nibs are a lot finer
2017-05-09 18:03:26	SlabDabs	ink also matters, a more 'wet' ink will look like a wider line

2017-05-09 18:03:43	SlabDabs	like I think with my Platinum Preppy i'm having issues because the stock included ink seems really dry
2017-05-09 18:04:13	arij	can you dilute it with a drop or two of water?
2017-05-09 18:04:15	SlabDabs	I think my vac mini stub makes for a good 'broad' though since it isn't as wide as my eco's 1.1
2017-05-09 18:04:28	SlabDabs	you can, that would more thin the color than influence viscosity as much
2017-05-09 18:04:36	arij	i wonder if my diamond is closer to your vac mini or eco

2017-05-10 00:29:28	switchy	I've heard that they're really hard to find in the us
2017-05-10 00:29:34	catfriend	dunno, i kinda would like a switch though!
2017-05-10 00:29:39	catfriend	i dunno which ius more important
2017-05-10 00:29:41	catfriend	videocard or switch
2017-05-10 00:29:50	slaytaner	video card
2017-05-10 00:29:54	slaytaner	100000%
2017-05-10 00:30:04	switchy	yeah, probably a video card
2017-05-10 00:30:08	slaytaner	switch is literally just a fancy zelda console atm
2017-05-10 00:30:16	switchy	slaytaner, you take that back
2017-05-10 00:30:25	switchy	even though that's what it is
2017-05-10 00:30:31	switchy	when stardew valley comes out for it though
2017-05-10 00:30:36	switchy	minecraft in a couple of days too heh
2017-05-10 00:30:52	switchy	slaytaner, binding of isaac has been out for like a month in the us, but not even a release date for it here
2017-05-10 00:30:54	switchy	so dumb
2017-05-10 00:31:17	catfriend	stardew is comin out on it?
2017-05-10 00:31:25	catfriend	is stardew ever getting multiplayer?
2017-05-10 00:31:42	switchy	it is coming to switch
2017-05-10 00:31:44	switchy	not sure when
2017-05-10 00:31:50	switchy	and I didn't realise it was getting multiplayer?
2017-05-10 00:31:54	switchy	it doesn't really seem like a multiplayer game
2017-05-10 00:32:13	catfriend	when it first came out
2017-05-10 00:32:15	catfriend	the dev guy
2017-05-10 00:32:18	catfriend	said multiplayer was coming
2017-05-10 00:32:28	catfriend	and everyone constantly asked him when it was coming
2017-05-10 00:32:32	catfriend	eventually he stopped ever mentioning it
2017-05-10 00:32:34	catfriend	so i bet it isnt coming eve
2017-05-10 00:33:13	switchy	Heh
2017-05-10 00:35:49	switchy	slaytaner, have you seen any of that playerunknown's whatever whatever?
2017-05-10 00:35:59	slaytaner	yeah
2017-05-10 00:36:18	switchy	it's a terrible name
2017-05-10 00:36:22	switchy	it looks kinda cool?
2017-05-10 00:36:33	slaytaner	looks exactly like day z standalone or whatever
2017-05-10 00:38:12	slaytaner	it looks a lot better now though
2017-05-10 00:38:27	slaytaner	switchy I like that they have real guns n shit
2017-05-10 00:38:39	slaytaner	and different ammos
2017-05-10 00:38:56	switchy	it seems more fun than day z because there's like an objective and stuff though
2017-05-10 00:39:01	switchy	and incorporates squads
2017-05-10 00:39:52	slaytaner	I was thinking of h1z1 koth
2017-05-10 00:39:57	slaytaner	switchy not day z
2017-05-10 00:39:59	slaytaner	lol
2017-05-10 00:40:01	switchy	ah
2017-05-10 00:40:11	switchy	isn't playerunknown behind h1z1 stuff anyway?
2017-05-10 00:40:18	switchy	so probably makes sense that it's very similar :P
2017-05-10 00:40:52	slaytaner	idk
2017-05-10 00:42:19	switchy	I don't like multiplayer games because my internet is too bad

2017-05-10 17:53:08	keveloper	to go to them

2017-05-10 17:53:26	keveloper	but then you have to /mouse disable to select text
2017-05-10 17:53:27	abbyaha	you bae

2017-05-10 17:54:26	keveloper	i turn it off tho because i select text a lot
2017-05-10 17:55:41	keveloper	when your tech lead doesn't know what a URI is <<<

2017-05-10 17:57:06	abbyaha	who doesnt know what a uri is?
2017-05-10 17:57:15	keveloper	dave
2017-05-10 17:57:23	abbyaha	???????
2017-05-10 17:57:26	keveloper	he thinks the /hello part of whatever.com/hello is a uri
2017-05-10 17:57:32	abbyaha	uh
2017-05-10 17:57:35	abbyaha	what
2017-05-10 17:58:14	keveloper	like
2017-05-10 17:58:20	keveloper	if URL is a subset of URI
2017-05-10 17:58:23	keveloper	and the whole thing is a URL
2017-05-10 17:58:26	keveloper	how is /hello a URI
2017-05-10 17:58:31	keveloper	now
2017-05-10 17:58:35	keveloper	if hello is a file or directory
2017-05-10 17:58:38	keveloper	at / on your machine
2017-05-10 17:58:40	keveloper	then /hello is a uri
2017-05-10 17:58:44	keveloper	but thats not what this is
2017-05-10 17:58:49	keveloper	ITS A PATH JUST CALL IT A PATH
2017-05-10 17:59:02	keveloper	abbyaha: i think he's trying to sound smart by using the term URI but he's using it incorrectly lol
2017-05-10 17:59:13	abbyaha	lol thats really embarrassing
2017-05-10 17:59:17	abbyaha	how is that a uri
2017-05-10 17:59:18	abbyaha	what
2017-05-10 17:59:21	keveloper	i mean
2017-05-10 17:59:24	keveloper	idk man
2017-05-10 17:59:34	keveloper	'URI' sounds cooler than 'path' i guess
2017-05-10 17:59:41	keveloper	URL vs URI used to confuse me
2017-05-10 17:59:44	abbyaha	i mean, sure
2017-05-10 17:59:47	keveloper	when i was a sophomore in college
2017-05-10 17:59:51	keveloper	who didn't do web dev
2017-05-10 18:00:01	abbyaha	ya i saw a venn diagram and then it was chill
2017-05-10 18:00:57	keveloper	but the easiest way to remember is that a URI has to have the HOW to get there
2017-05-10 18:01:00	keveloper	aka a scheme
2017-05-10 18:01:06	keveloper	so a URI HAS to start with a scheme

2017-05-11 14:29:10	zekkin	lets you change the colors and some other aesthetic things
2017-05-11 14:29:22	zekkin	na_th_an, yeah they're great headphones for the price

2017-05-11 14:33:23	arij	any color you want
2017-05-11 14:33:30	arij	im personally redoing mine with matte black

2017-05-11 14:33:44	arij	shiny black too many finger prints and shows scratches vv easily
2017-05-11 14:34:13	tr4656_	Thinking about whether blue or black is better
2017-05-11 14:34:21	arij	i have some one else that is doing skyblue
2017-05-11 14:34:53	arij	i personally think black is always the best since it seems to match with everything - hes going with skyblue so it matches skydolch but if he wanted to change the keycaps it probably wouldnt match
2017-05-11 14:34:59	arij	i suppose you can always get another top and bottom plate
2017-05-11 14:35:11	tr4656_	Yeah, probably black is better
2017-05-11 14:35:22	arij	matte or regular opaque shiny
2017-05-11 14:35:27	tr4656_	I guess blue matched last time because I was using Triumph Adler
2017-05-11 14:35:28	tr4656_	Matte
2017-05-11 14:35:46	tr4656_	Actually hmm
2017-05-11 14:35:50	tr4656_	Can I fit Hana on this
2017-05-11 14:35:56	tr4656_	If so, what color would match that
2017-05-11 14:36:06	arij	idunno - youd have to check the layout options
2017-05-11 14:36:15	arij	and idunno, white?
2017-05-11 14:36:18	arij	matte white?
2017-05-11 14:36:36	tr4656_	Actually black is fine

2017-05-12 11:27:10	arij	Which weight for zealios
2017-05-12 11:27:34	arij	You should do a split right shift

2017-05-12 11:35:53	_saracen	Yeah I think I have to
2017-05-12 11:35:54	na_th_an	or just replate the switches

2017-05-12 11:38:41	arij	i have mod h, mx clears, orange alps and 65g zealios i can send for testing or whatever

2017-05-12 11:40:04	arij	ahh
2017-05-12 11:40:22	arij	 maybe desolder and clean them?
2017-05-12 11:40:24	_saracen	I have to 'break' a few free before they travel
2017-05-12 11:40:42	arij	unless you can just pop the tops off and clean it that way?

2017-05-12 11:41:21	_saracen	Looks difficult, but possible
2017-05-12 11:43:09	_saracen	At that point, it might be easier to just desolder and put in a few new caps. I think I need like 12 new browns

2017-05-12 15:32:59	arij	the others dont
2017-05-12 15:33:07	arij	since i like you the most you can have it
2017-05-12 15:33:30	tr4656_	Yay
2017-05-12 15:33:31	arij	sucks since im losing money on this entire thing

2017-05-12 15:33:38	tr4656_	Wait how come
2017-05-12 15:33:49	arij	pcbway put a bunch of bad components on the pcbs
2017-05-12 15:34:01	arij	luckily i had spare rgb leds to replace the bad ones they put
2017-05-12 15:34:05	arij	but i dont have enough for all the boards
2017-05-12 15:34:09	arij	and its just a big headache
2017-05-12 15:34:19	tr4656_	Oh
2017-05-12 15:34:21	arij	i emailed them about it ... hopefully they refund me or make replacements
2017-05-12 15:35:20	arij	like the rgb leds are in a chain so if one doesnt work the ones after it dont work either
2017-05-12 15:35:52	arij	so like i find a dead one.. ok i replace it only to see the next one is dead, then replace that to see another one down the line.. RED from rgb doesnt work
2017-05-12 15:35:55	arij	and so on
2017-05-12 15:36:01	tr4656_	Oh

2017-05-12 15:44:43	arij	maybe something they had laying around? idunno
2017-05-12 15:44:49	arij	or their supplier dropped the ball who knows
2017-05-12 15:45:18	arij	lesson is dont have pcbway assemble the rgb leds, better to handsolder your self
2017-05-12 15:45:30	arij	or better yet dont have them do assembly at all - some one else i know had issues with them

2017-05-12 15:47:11	SlabDabs	pen addict slack in #sell-trade there's also /r/pen_swap
2017-05-12 15:47:24	tr4656_	I mean I think generally in the slack it's not bad
2017-05-12 15:47:34	arij	which one is more active?
2017-05-12 15:47:42	SlabDabs	also from people on the newnet irc server in #fountain_pens

2017-05-12 15:48:50	SlabDabs	yeah i've been using it regularly, pretty nice, no issues with it yet. it's interesting having the stub not as wide as my eco, but it makes it better for general use
2017-05-12 15:48:59	arij	like 30 seconds into the interview you realize oh this isnt so bad
2017-05-12 15:49:20	tr4656_	Yeah hopefully

2017-05-12 18:58:46	switchy	it's neat
2017-05-12 18:59:26	slaytaner	is it better than C
2017-05-12 18:59:32	slaytaner	or C++
2017-05-12 18:59:39	slaytaner	or C#
2017-05-12 18:59:48	slaytaner	or java
2017-05-12 19:00:13	switchy	it's in the C++ class
2017-05-12 19:00:39	switchy	it's easier than C++
2017-05-12 19:01:43	slaytaner	is C++ that difficult
2017-05-12 19:04:32	switchy	it just has a lot of stuff in it
2017-05-12 19:04:42	slaytaner	well yeah
2017-05-12 19:04:59	switchy	D's compile time template stuff is easier to understand
2017-05-12 19:05:10	switchy	it's more metaprogramming than a different language
2017-05-12 19:09:26	switchy	also you can basically run some programs as scripts
2017-05-12 19:09:28	switchy	which is neat
2017-05-12 19:10:11	slaytaner	is that like python

2017-05-12 19:57:45	catfriend	wow is getitng boring
2017-05-12 19:57:49	catfriend	not much to do in it
2017-05-12 19:58:59	slaytaner	catfriend I learned that lesson a long time ago
2017-05-12 19:59:18	slaytaner	it's real exciting for a few months then it gets boring as fuck
2017-05-12 19:59:43	catfriend	even raiding is so boring because theres such a low chance of me getting upgrades
2017-05-12 20:00:11	catfriend	basically 3 things need to happen for me to get an upgrade, all increasing unlikely. first that a good piece of gear for me drops, second that i actually win it based on EPGP loot system
2017-05-12 20:00:19	catfriend	third it has to TITANFORGE to at least 905 in most cases
2017-05-12 20:00:26	catfriend	from 885/890
2017-05-12 20:00:29	catfriend	which is pretty rare
2017-05-12 20:00:30	catfriend	so yeah
2017-05-12 20:00:35	catfriend	boo.
2017-05-12 20:03:51	slaytaner	catfriend what happened to DKP
2017-05-12 20:04:25	catfriend	lol everyone uses EPGP now
2017-05-12 20:04:51	slaytaner	what does that even stand for
2017-05-12 20:10:40	catfriend	effort points, gear points
2017-05-12 20:10:50	catfriend	basically you gain effort points for evrery boss you kill (and for being on time, and other stuff)
2017-05-12 20:10:57	catfriend	and whenever you get a piece of gear you get gear points
2017-05-12 20:11:07	catfriend	and when its time to decide who wins a piece of gear
2017-05-12 20:11:13	catfriend	they divide effort points by gear points
2017-05-12 20:11:18	catfriend	or is it gear points by effort points i forget
2017-05-12 20:11:20	catfriend	something liek thatr
2017-05-12 20:11:41	slaytaner	DKP is only reasonable points
2017-05-12 20:11:54	slaytaner	especially if whelps count

2017-05-12 20:55:45	arij	Enough to crank but not turn over
2017-05-12 20:56:18	switchy	ah
2017-05-12 20:56:31	switchy	I guess that's the easiest thing to try too
2017-05-12 20:56:47	switchy	it nearly fired first time
2017-05-12 20:57:15	switchy	the internet suggested maybe condensation in the tank, so water sank
2017-05-12 20:57:24	arij	Ya then that's probably it, you kept trying draining the battery a little more each time
2017-05-12 20:57:28	arij	Is what I told his
2017-05-12 20:57:34	arij	Is what I would guess*
2017-05-12 20:57:50	slaytaner	go down a hill and start it
2017-05-12 20:57:58	arij	Try shaking the bike a little? To swish around the gas
2017-05-12 20:58:05	arij	Or yea pop start
2017-05-12 20:58:11	arij	Easiest way
2017-05-12 20:58:21	arij	Pop it into second
2017-05-12 20:58:26	arij	Give it gas
2017-05-12 20:59:36	slaytaner	switchy does it need a new battery
2017-05-12 20:59:56	arij	Afaik motor cycle s don't recharge battery
2017-05-12 21:00:00	arij	No alternator
2017-05-12 21:02:48	switchy	they do have alternators
2017-05-12 21:02:53	slaytaner	ur an alternator
2017-05-12 21:03:06	switchy	no choke on mine because it's EFI
2017-05-12 21:03:25	slaytaner	is battery almost ded
2017-05-12 21:03:33	switchy	I don't know
2017-05-12 21:03:43	slaytaner	try the lights
2017-05-12 21:04:01	slaytaner	or just put in a new battery
2017-05-12 21:04:39	switchy	I don't have a new battery
2017-05-12 21:04:48	switchy	I'll try jumping it off a car first
2017-05-12 21:05:27	slaytaner	acquire a new battery
2017-05-12 21:05:48	switchy	that sounds more expensive
2017-05-12 21:06:03	slaytaner	I guess
2017-05-12 21:06:05	switchy	I'll try this first
2017-05-12 21:06:13	slaytaner	you should get a trickle charger
2017-05-12 21:08:05	switchy	yeah, I might do that instead
2017-05-12 21:08:21	switchy	the internet says it could break my battery to jump it from a car
2017-05-12 21:09:16	switchy	it is in a driveway at the top of a hill, maybe I can roll start?
2017-05-12 21:12:50	switchy	this is the worst

2017-05-12 21:13:53	arij	umm
2017-05-12 21:14:09	arij	switchy: did you start it
2017-05-12 21:14:17	switchy	no
2017-05-12 21:14:21	arij	i would try roll start tbh but you gotta do it quick like
2017-05-12 21:14:29	arij	dont hesitate to put it into second and hit the gas
2017-05-12 21:14:56	arij	but also idk dont listen to me
2017-05-12 21:15:23	switchy	noo be confident
2017-05-12 21:15:41	arij	ive done it to my sportster before but your bike looks expensive
2017-05-12 21:15:54	arij	i trust my self doing it to my own vehicles,
2017-05-12 21:15:56	SlabDabs	it will only climb higher again
2017-05-12 21:16:07	arij	^^
2017-05-12 21:16:12	SlabDabs	natural for it to drop after a peak with people selling
2017-05-12 21:16:20	arij	exactly my thoughts
2017-05-12 21:16:32	arij	need to get the sellers out of the way for real rally to come
2017-05-12 21:16:49	switchy	arij: I will try a roll start...
2017-05-12 21:17:13	switchy	just roll down hill in 2nd and drop clutch?
2017-05-12 21:18:16	arij	yup - slaytaner can you confirm
2017-05-12 21:18:32	arij	just so i dont get blamed if something goes wrong
2017-05-12 21:18:38	arij	its going to probably jerk like
2017-05-12 21:18:43	arij	how to explain
2017-05-12 21:18:59	arij	like it might skid, like the tires lock up ya know
2017-05-12 21:19:09	arij	just be ready for that, dont drop the bike
2017-05-12 21:19:48	arij	Insert your key and turn the ignition on (make sure the engine kill switch is also on). Put the bike into second gear, this will help prevent the bike from jerking when it starts. You will need to get the bike moving to at least 5MPH or 8KMH so pull in the clutch while seated on the bike and have your friends push.
2017-05-12 21:20:03	switchy	I have no friends, just a hill
2017-05-12 21:20:06	arij	yea that works too
2017-05-12 21:20:08	arij	lol
2017-05-12 21:20:26	arij	yea i always pop it into second, i guess it avoids the jerking that 1st causes
2017-05-12 21:20:43	arij	but also if it starts
2017-05-12 21:20:50	arij	that doesnt mean itll start the second time
2017-05-12 21:20:57	arij	but you say it has an alternator so it might charge up the battery
2017-05-12 21:21:59	switchy	rip didn't work
2017-05-12 21:22:45	arij	fuck
2017-05-12 21:22:54	arij	did you hear the engine trying to turn over at all
2017-05-12 21:23:01	arij	maybe you werent going fast enough
2017-05-12 21:23:25	switchy	yeah
2017-05-12 21:24:00	arij	probably have to go a little faster then - if you have a warranty on the battery just go get a replacement? or drop it off at the shop and have them trickle charge it
2017-05-12 21:24:14	arij	autozone and other car part stores here do it for free
2017-05-12 21:24:54	arij	i would try to run with it a little then hop on it rolling down  the hill to maximize speed
2017-05-12 21:25:00	arij	but i beat on my bike
2017-05-12 21:25:02	arij	when i had one
2017-05-12 21:25:16	switchy	I just don't want to drop it
2017-05-12 21:25:23	arij	yea that would be realllllly bad
2017-05-12 21:25:39	arij	its not worth it - just try to get a new battery or get that one charged up
2017-05-12 21:25:44	arij	that bike looks brand new
2017-05-12 21:25:52	arij	i wouldnt want to mess with it too much
2017-05-12 21:26:58	na_th_an	arij: what is the switch you sent to me again?
2017-05-12 21:27:06	arij	mod-h

2017-05-12 21:35:44	switchy	arij: this is the worst :(
2017-05-12 21:36:02	switchy	I bought this bike so it wouldn't have problems!
2017-05-12 21:36:08	arij	aw man sorry to hear that man
2017-05-12 21:36:16	arij	is this the first time trying to start it since you got back?
2017-05-12 21:36:27	arij	i mean it was sitting for months... its not too surprising
2017-05-12 21:36:31	switchy	yeah
2017-05-12 21:36:38	switchy	well my shitty car started first time
2017-05-12 21:36:44	switchy	and it's been sitting outside
2017-05-12 21:36:52	arij	car battery holds a lot more juice
2017-05-12 21:36:52	switchy	bike has been in a garage
2017-05-12 21:36:55	switchy	yeah true
2017-05-12 21:37:08	switchy	also my car would probably run in the apocalypse
2017-05-12 21:37:59	arij	lol
2017-05-12 21:38:07	arij	sorry to hear the bike isnt starting though that is a real bummer
2017-05-12 21:38:18	arij	whats a new battery? $100?
2017-05-12 21:38:28	arij	thats how much they were for my bike..
2017-05-12 21:38:31	switchy	yeah maybe
2017-05-12 21:38:41	switchy	but things are in dollarydoos here
2017-05-12 21:38:48	arij	so $140 or so
2017-05-12 21:39:31	switchy	I might try to jump it from a car first, and then I probably have a trickle charger at home somewhere
2017-05-12 21:41:12	switchy	and if that fails I'll get a battery
2017-05-12 21:45:49	slaytaner	I bet it's the battery
2017-05-12 21:48:08	arij	i jumped my bike from another bike before

2017-05-13 19:32:40	slaytaner	if you want to fly them for business you have to get a remote pilots license

2017-05-13 19:33:13	switchy	registration is like $5
2017-05-13 19:33:20	switchy	and you just need to write the number on somewhere
2017-05-13 19:33:33	switchy	and you just need to notify airports within like 5mi of where you're flying

2017-05-13 19:33:54	slaytaner	but I'm close

2017-05-13 23:54:43	switchy	how's it going?
2017-05-13 23:55:45	catfriend	pretty good you guys?
2017-05-13 23:57:24	switchy	it's raining a fucklot :(
2017-05-13 23:57:29	switchy	I wanted to go fly again
2017-05-14 00:04:12	switchy	eep scary thunder
2017-05-14 00:07:01	slaytaner	switchy do you have tornados in aus
2017-05-14 00:08:14	switchy	not really
2017-05-14 00:08:25	switchy	tropical cyclones hit nt/north queensland fairly often
2017-05-14 00:10:04	switchy	although I'm not really clear on the distinction between the different wind based circles
2017-05-14 00:15:01	slaytaner	hurricaines/cyclones are relatively slow and predictable, tornados are fast and unpredictable
2017-05-14 00:16:26	slaytaner	with a tornado one block will be perfectly fine and the next will be gone
2017-05-14 00:19:01	slaytaner	anyway I'm out, l8rs
2017-05-14 00:19:38	switchy	yeah, we don't have those
2017-05-14 00:19:40	switchy	bye slaytaner

2017-05-14 22:51:05	xveamvx	the navara that is
2017-05-14 22:51:22	xveamvx	because it seems like they are just recycling old Nissan Frontier designs for the navara
2017-05-14 22:51:45	xveamvx	because that looks like a combination of my 98 Frontier and my sisters 2003 Frontier
2017-05-14 22:53:11	xveamvx	I literally think it is
2017-05-14 22:53:28	xveamvx	because Frontier parts fit 98-2004

2017-05-15 13:14:43	arij	ic ant believe i slept until 1
2017-05-15 13:15:04	na_th_an	jelly
2017-05-15 13:15:19	na_th_an	I haven't slept past 10 in awhile
2017-05-15 13:15:29	na_th_an	I supposed it's part of growing up
2017-05-15 13:15:40	arij	i usually dont either but i woke up at 6 then went back to sleep
2017-05-15 13:19:02	SlabDabs	i wake up around 6 every day
2017-05-15 13:19:05	SlabDabs	no alarm
2017-05-15 13:20:37	na_th_an	I wake up at 6:54 every weekday now
2017-05-15 13:20:57	na_th_an	but somehow my brain is completely aware of when weekends are and will gladly sleep in until 9
2017-05-15 13:21:56	SlabDabs	i've woken up at 6am eight times this month, 7am 4 times, then the last 3 were 6:30ish
2017-05-15 13:22:09	SlabDabs	my alarms are set for 8am, so they haven't woken me once
2017-05-15 13:22:29	zekkin	i wake up before my alarm consistently
2017-05-15 13:22:40	na_th_an	yeah now that I have a set schedule I do
2017-05-15 13:22:46	na_th_an	never ever did when I was in school
2017-05-15 13:22:54	zekkin	i did :|
2017-05-15 13:23:04	na_th_an	my classes were always at different times in the morning
2017-05-15 13:23:06	zekkin	but i also made it a point to be done with classes before noon
2017-05-15 13:23:08	na_th_an	so I woke up at a different time every day
2017-05-15 13:23:35	zekkin	it was always worth it to me
2017-05-15 13:24:01	na_th_an	I always tried to do that but scheduling was a total PITA
2017-05-15 13:24:04	zekkin	i'd get back from classes and my roommates would be going to their first class
2017-05-15 13:24:07	na_th_an	I was lucky if I got into the classes I needed
2017-05-15 13:24:14	zekkin	yeah freshman and sophomore year were annoying
2017-05-15 13:24:20	na_th_an	even my senior year I had that issue
2017-05-15 13:24:22	zekkin	but once you're an upperclassman registering was ezpz
2017-05-15 13:24:24	zekkin	oh :(
2017-05-15 13:24:30	na_th_an	because I transeferred in with a bunch of credits already
2017-05-15 13:24:42	zekkin	but that should have put you ahead of most people registering?
2017-05-15 13:24:45	na_th_an	and had to wait until I took software I/II before I could take any "real" classes in the major
2017-05-15 13:24:49	zekkin	at least that's how i envisioned it
2017-05-15 13:24:53	na_th_an	well yeah it does
2017-05-15 13:25:08	na_th_an	but because of the dependency issues I had really specific classes I had to take
2017-05-15 13:25:14	zekkin	well i'm glad i don't have to worry about registration issues
2017-05-15 13:25:18	na_th_an	and I was on the same level as the other people needing to take those classes
2017-05-15 13:25:23	zekkin	the system always went down when registration time rolled around
2017-05-15 13:25:26	zekkin	every semester
2017-05-15 13:25:26	na_th_an	and I had no gen eds that I could use to pad my schedule
2017-05-15 13:34:48	arij	tr4656_: "the real reason is not the LED quality issue, just because our supplier forgot to send specific instruction to our assembly department, so the LEDs were ruined after wrong operation. "
2017-05-15 13:35:12	tr4656_	Lol
2017-05-15 13:35:26	arij	" I am sorry for this, and we will offer $20 to your account for such mistake."
2017-05-15 13:35:29	arij	o_o
2017-05-15 13:35:48	tr4656_	Is that even enough
2017-05-15 13:35:52	arij	lolno
2017-05-15 13:35:56	tr4656_	That's like barely anything
2017-05-15 13:36:04	arij	iw ent off on them after they said that
2017-05-15 13:36:16	arij	waiting for response from the "leader"
2017-05-15 13:36:53	arij	oh they thought i fixed all of them
2017-05-15 13:36:59	arij	but i told them i was able to fix two of them
2017-05-15 13:37:08	SlabDabs	wtf $20
2017-05-15 13:37:11	arij	thing is credit is also useless to me
2017-05-15 13:37:12	SlabDabs	that's fucked up
2017-05-15 13:37:14	arij	yea it is
2017-05-15 13:37:20	SlabDabs	they should credit for the ENTIRE order they fucked up
2017-05-15 13:37:28	SlabDabs	$20 is nothing
2017-05-15 13:37:36	arij	they should
2017-05-15 13:37:41	arij	i didnt pay for these
2017-05-15 13:37:45	arij	i paid for something else which i didnt receive
2017-05-15 13:37:45	SlabDabs	if you paid by credit card and they don't fix it I'd do a chargeback honestly
2017-05-15 13:37:53	arij	i think it was paypal
2017-05-15 13:37:58	SlabDabs	dispute it
2017-05-15 13:38:04	SlabDabs	but see if they will correct it first
2017-05-15 13:38:07	arij	ya
2017-05-15 13:38:16	arij	they admitted to messing up so
2017-05-15 13:38:17	SlabDabs	i'd feel more insulted by the $20 than nothing
2017-05-15 13:38:20	SlabDabs	yeah
2017-05-15 13:38:22	arij	yea seriously
2017-05-15 13:38:27	arij	and its not even a refund
2017-05-15 13:38:29	arij	its credit
2017-05-15 13:38:33	arij	why would i use them again after that lol
2017-05-15 13:38:39	SlabDabs	seriously
2017-05-15 13:38:46	SlabDabs	refund or chargeback/dispute
2017-05-15 13:38:55	SlabDabs	you have them admitting they fucked up so it will be clear cut
2017-05-15 13:39:01	tr4656_	Yeah
2017-05-15 13:39:59	arij	ya
2017-05-15 13:40:29	arij	i wouldnt mind a refund on 3 of them because i was able to fix to of them - or just for them to remake those
2017-05-15 13:40:34	arij	lets see what they say
2017-05-15 13:41:16	SlabDabs	you still had to fix it and they didn't deliver as expected
2017-05-15 13:41:26	arij	ya
2017-05-15 13:41:26	SlabDabs	so you should get compensated at minimum partially on those
2017-05-15 13:43:23	na_th_an	arij: what happened with the LEDs?
2017-05-15 13:43:46	arij	they couldnt assemble them properly and send me pcbs with rgb leds that dont work and were all messed up

2017-05-16 15:36:55	na_th_an	I wonder how much better or worse RL would be if they were on UE4 instead of UE3
2017-05-16 15:37:10	keveloper	lol
2017-05-16 15:37:13	na_th_an	some of the issues they have are because they're on an old version of unreal

2017-05-17 11:28:25	arij	its first come first serve to its probably going to sell out vv quickly - considering its already trading at above 50 cents
2017-05-17 11:28:30	arij	and the token sale is for 50 cents each
2017-05-17 11:28:45	na_th_an	yeah this is something I'm interested in
2017-05-17 11:29:30	arij	na_th_an: if you only participated in icos
2017-05-17 11:29:34	arij	and didnt trade at all
2017-05-17 11:29:38	arij	thats where the profits are at
2017-05-17 11:29:44	arij	its a good strat
2017-05-17 11:29:46	na_th_an	icos?
2017-05-17 11:29:49	arij	ya
2017-05-17 11:30:01	arij	initial coin offering, its similar to this token sale
2017-05-17 11:30:05	na_th_an	oh
2017-05-17 11:30:11	na_th_an	ya makes sense
2017-05-17 11:30:52	arij	last one i got in was gnosis, like 3 weeks ago?.... bought 133 gnosis at $29 each, currently they are worth $122 each
2017-05-17 11:31:17	arij	ohhhhh lollllll i ordered a few jellykeys
2017-05-17 11:31:34	arij	i cancelled one and got refunded but they still have it marked as paid like theyre about to ship it lul
2017-05-17 11:31:45	na_th_an	so I'd get storej tokens that I could then sell once they go up in value (hopefully) right?
2017-05-17 11:31:59	arij	yup
2017-05-17 11:32:08	arij	you just transfer storj tokens to polo and sell
2017-05-17 11:32:21	na_th_an	yea this is something I'm interested in
2017-05-17 11:32:27	arij	or if you hold... they could go up to like $3 or more each then your making like 6x your investment

2017-05-17 11:33:07	arij	but theyd be locked up for 3 months
2017-05-17 11:35:01	na_th_an	ya I do not have 50k sry
2017-05-17 11:35:26	arij	wat
2017-05-17 11:35:36	arij	we need 50k between how ever many people

2017-05-17 11:35:55	keveloper	arij: i can do $50

2017-05-17 11:37:42	arij	gnosis sold out in like 3 minutes
2017-05-17 11:37:49	tr4656_	But $50k min
2017-05-17 11:37:55	arij	no, 50k min for pre-sale
2017-05-17 11:38:00	arij	so you dont have to be a part of the mad dash
2017-05-17 11:38:10	arij	if you wait until friday you can put in $1
2017-05-17 11:38:19	arij	each token costs 50 cents so there is no minimum
2017-05-17 11:38:31	arij	shit, put in $10 just to see, then you can go bigger on the next one

2017-05-17 11:39:00	arij	well if you're slow yea, theyll sell out before you can get any

2017-05-17 11:39:22	arij	you can buy them after the fact on an exchange, but i doubt they'll be selling for 50 cents

2017-05-17 18:57:15	switchy	slaytaner, yeah, it runs
2017-05-17 18:57:24	slaytaner	you probably blew a fuse
2017-05-17 18:57:31	switchy	but it lugs under acceleration
2017-05-17 18:57:42	switchy	it was super struggling up slight inclines
2017-05-17 18:57:50	switchy	like I'd lost a cylinder or something
2017-05-17 18:58:09	slaytaner	check the fuses
2017-05-17 18:58:26	abbyaha	just.....create a new cylinder
2017-05-17 18:58:30	switchy	what fuse would it have blown?
2017-05-17 18:58:30	abbyaha	throw it under the hood

2017-05-17 19:00:46	switchy	slaytaner, I was thinking spark plugs or fuel filter/lines
2017-05-17 19:00:56	arij	i was about to say fuel filter
2017-05-17 19:00:59	slaytaner	wait switchy are you talking about electric power or car power

2017-05-17 19:03:33	switchy	I guess spark stuff is easier
2017-05-17 19:03:47	arij	you;d have to physically remove the fuel filter to check it and at that point you might as well replace it
2017-05-17 19:04:12	switchy	there was a box of plug wires or something in the boot when I got the car
2017-05-17 19:04:21	switchy	maybe somebody tried to fix something at some point
2017-05-17 19:04:32	arij	cap and wires and plugs easy to change

2017-05-17 22:49:52	arij	if it has a highprofile aluminum case
2017-05-17 22:49:56	arij	it would be perfect
2017-05-17 22:50:03	arij	depends,
2017-05-17 22:50:18	arij	im not sure .... i guess it depends which layout you choose for the bottom row
2017-05-17 22:50:33	na_th_an	oh yeah you linked me that thing but I did not understand it at all tbh
2017-05-17 22:51:34	na_th_an	but yeah if you don't need a special keyset then I think people will be interested
2017-05-17 22:51:44	na_th_an	that's the biggest pain about the cool keyboard layouts
2017-05-17 22:51:58	na_th_an	and since you got cool underglow the rgb plebs might be interested
2017-05-17 22:58:12	arij	lollll

2017-05-18 10:41:08	SlabDabs	Is there anyone in here who doesn't have a fountain pen yet? I have a good number of cheaper ones I want to gift at this point
2017-05-18 10:43:00	_saracen	I do not
2017-05-18 10:43:12	_saracen	I didn't think that this was going to blow up so quickly
2017-05-18 10:44:03	tr4656_	SlabDabs: What pen are you looking at these days
2017-05-18 10:44:55	_saracen	And Abby has always had a lot of trouble getting enough sleep. Apparently during Spring she basically has insomnia. She's gotten like 2-3 hours of sleep a night for the last week
2017-05-18 10:45:48	SlabDabs	tr4656_: oh man i'm not sure. I don't need anything. 3 i'd probably get though would be the Sailor 1911, Platinum 3776 or Lamy 2000
2017-05-18 10:45:50	_saracen	Alright, I'm back to lurking
2017-05-18 10:46:09	SlabDabs	first two are supposed to be good but I'm more into piston fillers
2017-05-18 10:46:12	tr4656_	Wait you don't have these?
2017-05-18 10:46:16	tr4656_	I have all 3
2017-05-18 10:46:17	SlabDabs	negative
2017-05-18 10:46:20	SlabDabs	nice
2017-05-18 10:46:28	tr4656_	I agree that all of them are good
2017-05-18 10:46:34	tr4656_	You should buy a 3776
2017-05-18 10:46:40	tr4656_	Grey Markey it's sub 100
2017-05-18 10:46:42	SlabDabs	3776 soft fine
2017-05-18 10:46:46	SlabDabs	amazon has em for $75
2017-05-18 10:46:48	tr4656_	Oh
2017-05-18 10:46:50	tr4656_	Yes
2017-05-18 10:46:59	tr4656_	I recommend one
2017-05-18 10:47:23	tr4656_	I personally like Pro Gear II > 1911
2017-05-18 10:47:25	SlabDabs	Yeah, I just don't need to yet
2017-05-18 10:47:58	SlabDabs	i'd hope so, they're twice as expensive lol
2017-05-18 10:48:03	SlabDabs	at least for the import/amazon market
2017-05-18 10:48:08	SlabDabs	1911 is around $115
2017-05-18 10:48:23	tr4656_	My personal 1911 is a XXF grind by Masuyama ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-05-18 10:48:41	SlabDabs	nice
2017-05-18 10:49:02	SlabDabs	I keep telling myself no pens over $100 unless I handle it in person first
2017-05-18 10:49:16	SlabDabs	mostly just to stop myself from spending the money
2017-05-18 10:49:26	tr4656_	Well you're likely never buying a Nakaya then?
2017-05-18 10:49:29	SlabDabs	how would you say the l2k compares to like the 3776 though?
2017-05-18 10:49:32	SlabDabs	haha pretty much
2017-05-18 10:49:43	SlabDabs	that high in price is just silly to me, i've already spent too much
2017-05-18 10:49:49	tr4656_	I guess Classic Fountain Pens does show at SF Pen Shown
2017-05-18 10:50:08	tr4656_	Uh for me they are kind of different pens
2017-05-18 10:50:13	SlabDabs	maybe if I start making some 'fuck you money' levels of income I would order stuff like that
2017-05-18 10:50:21	SlabDabs	oh yeah, totally different styles and I know that
2017-05-18 10:50:31	tr4656_	3776 is your traditional acrylic Japanese pen
2017-05-18 10:50:46	tr4656_	I probably like the L2K more because of the look
2017-05-18 10:50:53	tr4656_	And the feel is nice
2017-05-18 10:51:05	tr4656_	But I also have a few acrylic pens already
2017-05-18 10:51:13	SlabDabs	Yeah, I just feel like the 1911/3776 just don't bring anything 'special' to the table. and when I have a pilot falcon theres not a need for another basic C/C
2017-05-18 10:51:18	arij	pens are wack
2017-05-18 10:51:21	arij	keyboards are wack
2017-05-18 10:51:24	arij	everything is wack
2017-05-18 10:51:28	SlabDabs	arij is wack
2017-05-18 10:51:36	tr4656_	SlabDabs: I totally ordered one on a programmer's salary so idk
2017-05-18 10:51:45	tr4656_	Don't need to make that much
2017-05-18 10:51:57	arij	arij no wack
2017-05-18 10:52:28	tr4656_	I think that the 1911 is a very classic pen that's honestly just pretty solid
2017-05-18 10:52:46	tr4656_	The Pilot Falcon was always a bit weird when I tried other people's
2017-05-18 10:53:37	arij	i meant to say that here
2017-05-18 10:53:41	arij	not in mk
2017-05-18 10:54:12	tr4656_	Idk you should get one of the two
2017-05-18 10:54:26	tr4656_	Just got a more traditional Japanese nib rather than flez
2017-05-18 10:57:12	SlabDabs	tr4656_: oh I'm sure I'll feel different once I move, colorado just has too high of a cost of living so at the end of each month i'm literally left with nothing aside from paying bills to live here another month
2017-05-18 10:57:27	tr4656_	Colorado has a high cost of living?
2017-05-18 10:57:33	tr4656_	That's surprising
2017-05-18 10:57:44	SlabDabs	not sure if joking
2017-05-18 10:57:47	tr4656_	Why is it so expensive
2017-05-18 10:57:50	tr4656_	I'm serious
2017-05-18 10:58:10	tr4656_	I've basically lived in California the whole time I lived in the states
2017-05-18 10:58:15	SlabDabs	slow housing expansion, large amount of people moving here, artifically inflated do to the 'green rush' (marijuana)
2017-05-18 10:58:28	SlabDabs	well yeah, Cali is worse, but their pay rate has also increased with housing
2017-05-18 10:58:33	SlabDabs	colorado is still shit wages
2017-05-18 10:58:57	SlabDabs	houses are literally three times as expensive in CO than FL (where i'm moving back to) for the same amount of house
2017-05-18 10:59:05	tr4656_	Oh wow
2017-05-18 10:59:26	SlabDabs	in my zip for under $250k there are two empty lots for $125 and 175k, and a duplex unit for 225. Florida I had a 2/2 house under contract for 115k
2017-05-18 10:59:46	tr4656_	Oh
2017-05-18 10:59:51	SlabDabs	like. literally those 3 listings
2017-05-18 11:00:20	SlabDabs	renting a 1/1 for $1250 here, getting a 2/2 duplex unit with a porch and yard in fl for 900/mo
2017-05-18 11:00:29	@zekkin	oh right
2017-05-18 11:00:33	SlabDabs	like 8 minutes from the beach
2017-05-18 11:00:35	tr4656_	That sounds cheap
2017-05-18 11:00:40	arij	i wanna go to the beach
2017-05-18 11:00:46	tr4656_	My friend is trying to rent in San Jose
2017-05-18 11:00:53	arij	ewwww
2017-05-18 11:00:58	tr4656_	A 1/1 is 2k

2017-05-18 11:01:11	SlabDabs	Yeah, I bet the wages in the area are MUCH better than colorado's average wage
2017-05-18 11:01:13	arij	tr4656_: r u close to la
2017-05-18 11:01:34	tr4656_	SF

2017-05-18 11:01:53	tr4656_	SlabDabs: Yeah he's getting paid like 100k+ from Amazon too
2017-05-18 11:02:07	tr4656_	But a lot of that goes away from tax so
2017-05-18 11:02:10	SlabDabs	i talked to someone who was looking to move to colorado, housing expenses would almost double from his place in georgia but jobs were offering the same hourly
2017-05-18 11:02:23	SlabDabs	that is 2.5x what I make as an art director right now......
2017-05-18 11:02:51	SlabDabs	well was making a week ago
2017-05-18 11:04:15	tr4656_	I see
2017-05-18 11:05:10	SlabDabs	so many people flooding the state and accepting jobs at the low rates it's not climbing either

2017-05-21 14:53:11	zekkin	but i've never actually gotten mad while i was driving until i moved to minnesota
2017-05-21 14:53:40	zekkin	drove in the northeast for 6 years, from when i got my license until i moved
2017-05-21 14:53:48	zekkin	sure, there are shitty drivers everywhere
2017-05-21 14:53:55	zekkin	but certain places are exceptionally more shitty than others
2017-05-21 14:57:09	arij	Ya
2017-05-21 15:00:40	shrimp	everything is (terrible), everything is cool when you're (constantly being strung on by the only girl who's reciprocated feelings for you but has constantly led you to question any sort of romantic pursuit)
2017-05-21 15:04:13	arij	Lol what

2017-05-21 15:28:18	abbyaha	its pretty weak of her to ghost you
2017-05-21 15:28:41	shrimp	yep
2017-05-21 15:28:44	abbyaha	in the end, it will be a good thing since clearly shes not brave enough or good enough to not lead you on
2017-05-21 15:29:21	shrimp	abbyaha: it won't be a good thing because I like her and she's not responding to anything I'm saying
2017-05-21 15:29:34	shrimp	this is objectively bad
2017-05-21 15:30:18	abbyaha	you wont always like her, and think, is this the kind of person you want to date? one that leads you on and wont even text you back about plans?

2017-05-21 15:33:53	shrimp	abbyaha: my opinions of people don't usually change and i don't think she's doing this intentionally since she's a really nice person
2017-05-21 15:34:59	abbyaha	well just be careful, you deserve better than being ghosted

2017-05-22 03:35:59	switchy	I want a filesystem that does something different to the usual hierarchical model
2017-05-22 03:36:07	switchy	I think beos had a fairly unique filesystem
2017-05-22 03:39:58	slaytaner	I like how their cipher choice boiled down to "well doing it right is hard so we picked this relatively new thing that looks promising"
2017-05-22 03:40:50	slaytaner	anyway I'm out, night

2017-05-22 09:29:11	na_th_an	applesauce?

2017-05-22 09:30:37	Berzerker	I love how step 1 is to remove pots/pans from oven
2017-05-22 09:31:20	zekkin	good first step tbh

2017-05-22 10:44:43	Berzerker	ceramic
2017-05-22 10:45:01	SlabDabs	they also work well to absorb heat and keep it more stable while baking
2017-05-22 10:45:07	SlabDabs	even if you don't cook directly on them
2017-05-22 10:45:42	cdsboy	I actually don't make pizza on it
2017-05-22 10:45:50	cdsboy	abbyaha: brussels sprouts were the last thing
2017-05-22 10:46:01	abbyaha	yum
2017-05-22 10:46:05	cdsboy	but like, basically anything you want to bake that's small loose items

2017-05-22 13:42:07	Roxas	Darude was fuckin sick on friday
2017-05-22 13:42:45	Roxas	he had the whole crowd chant and he recorded it and chopped it into his mix. it was p interesting
2017-05-22 13:42:51	slaytaner	relish is the best
2017-05-22 13:42:54	Roxas	wrong
2017-05-22 13:42:58	abbyaha	slaytaner--

2017-05-22 13:43:30	slaytaner	D:
2017-05-22 13:43:57	na_th_an	i won't -- you but i 100% agree
2017-05-22 13:43:57	Roxas	i love dill pickles and even dill relish is disgusting imo. sweet relish is the fucking worst
2017-05-22 13:44:15	zekkin	relish is bad
2017-05-22 13:44:19	zekkin	and you should feel bad
2017-05-22 13:44:25	slaytaner	D:
2017-05-22 13:44:29	zekkin	if you want pickles just put pickles on the hot dog
2017-05-22 13:44:47	Roxas	i like my hot dogs pretty basic
2017-05-22 13:44:55	zekkin	i actually don't like hot dogs
2017-05-22 13:44:58	zekkin	not really, at least
2017-05-22 13:45:13	Roxas	you know whats really awful? boiled hot dogs
2017-05-22 13:45:22	slaytaner	is it a southern thing?
2017-05-22 13:45:33	na_th_an	boiled hot dogs are 98% of hotdogs in ohio
2017-05-22 13:45:41	Roxas	its an uncultured white people thing
2017-05-22 13:45:45	Roxas	for those who dont know better
2017-05-22 13:45:47	zekkin	i bet they're not even beef
2017-05-22 13:45:55	na_th_an	no, beef pork & chicken!
2017-05-22 13:46:06	na_th_an	i wish i were kidding
2017-05-22 13:46:07	slaytaner	I've found a good way is a griddle with a little bit of water
2017-05-22 13:46:13	Roxas	at least parts of the animals that beef, chicken, and pork come from
2017-05-22 13:46:33	zekkin	i think i'd downright refuse to eat a non-beef hot dog
2017-05-22 13:46:40	abbyaha	na_th_an: did you ever go to the hot dog guy on campus
2017-05-22 13:46:40	Roxas	grill is always my preferred method but its not always practical
2017-05-22 13:46:59	na_th_an	abbyaha: idk probably not?
2017-05-22 13:47:08	abbyaha	they were so good there

2017-05-22 14:22:05	arij	"I'm in a open relationship looking for friends with benefits with people who are actually friends"
2017-05-22 14:22:17	abbyaha	too messy Roxas
2017-05-22 14:22:35	na_th_an	"friends with benefits" is a dumb term
2017-05-22 14:22:38	slaytaner	wat arij
2017-05-22 14:22:40	arij	thats what they said
2017-05-22 14:22:45	abbyaha	the weekend girl?
2017-05-22 14:22:46	na_th_an	it makes it sound like "oh ya I'm friends with that guy but he gets to touch my boob"
2017-05-22 14:22:52	arij	some other girl that messaged me
2017-05-22 14:23:03	arij	na_th_an: that sounds p cool
2017-05-22 14:23:04	Roxas	na_th_an: thats essentially it
2017-05-22 14:23:27	Roxas	but a lot of the time he gets to touch the inside of her vagine with his penis
2017-05-22 14:23:29	na_th_an	generally it's more "we fuck for fun" than "that guy's my friend but gets the benifit of touching my boob"
2017-05-22 14:23:29	abbyaha	i always feel like someone gets feelings in fwb
2017-05-22 14:23:40	Roxas	abbyaha: more often than not
2017-05-22 14:23:42	abbyaha	ive never seen it work out well
2017-05-22 14:23:52	slaytaner	it didn't work out well for me
2017-05-22 14:23:56	Roxas	me either
2017-05-22 14:24:01	na_th_an	"friends with benefits" reminds me of middle school when a guy is friends with a girl he likes but the girl doesn't like him but they wanna be friends still so the girl gives him a benefit or two
2017-05-22 14:24:13	zekkin	lets just be real
2017-05-22 14:24:20	zekkin	and call it "friends that fuck"
2017-05-22 14:24:23	slaytaner	well less me more her, but now I feel really bad about it still
2017-05-22 14:24:28	na_th_an	zekkin: exactly
2017-05-22 14:24:28	Roxas	zekkin: yup
2017-05-22 14:24:38	na_th_an	"fuckbuddies" is a way better word

2017-05-22 14:28:49	abbyaha	i would also avoid
2017-05-22 14:28:50	na_th_an	arij: yes
2017-05-22 14:28:53	arij	wtf why
2017-05-22 14:28:58	na_th_an	open relationship is a red flag to me

2017-05-22 14:29:07	arij	i dont want a relationship
2017-05-22 14:29:11	arij	like a serious one
2017-05-22 14:29:12	na_th_an	in my experience every person who has ever bene in an open relationship is bat shit insane
2017-05-22 14:29:13	na_th_an	and unstable
2017-05-22 14:29:23	na_th_an	but that's just my experience
2017-05-22 14:29:24	abbyaha	yep exactly my reasoning na_th_an
2017-05-22 14:29:28	arij	boring
2017-05-22 14:29:28	abbyaha	my crazy roomie
2017-05-22 14:29:34	zekkin	like, what if the dude in the relationship realizes he doesn't want to be in an open relationship and decides he needs to fight you
2017-05-22 14:29:36	na_th_an	I mean the sex will probably be good
2017-05-22 14:29:39	na_th_an	you do you
2017-05-22 14:30:03	arij	zekkin: then ill fight
2017-05-22 14:30:04	abbyaha	probably, as long as she ALWAYS uses protection
2017-05-22 14:30:07	arij	if some one tries to fight me
2017-05-22 14:30:20	cdsboy	are they like swingers or open relationship where they can have their own SOs?
2017-05-22 14:30:25	zekkin	sounds like a situation you can just avoid in the first place
2017-05-22 14:30:26	arij	idunno
2017-05-22 14:30:37	cdsboy	I worked with someone who went to swingers parties
2017-05-22 14:30:39	abbyaha	arij: i feel like there are easier situations
2017-05-22 14:30:45	arij	you are just assuming all people in open relationships are crazy
2017-05-22 14:30:49	abbyaha	cdsboy: lol and they shared with you?
2017-05-22 14:30:55	arij	seems pretty normal these days
2017-05-22 14:30:55	cdsboy	abbyaha: nah lol
2017-05-22 14:31:02	abbyaha	arij: its your decision, if you want to message her then do it
2017-05-22 14:31:11	arij	i already messaged her
2017-05-22 14:31:11	cdsboy	swinging seems almost do-able since you can silo it into parties and keep exceptions there
2017-05-22 14:31:20	slaytaner	I assume all people are crazy
2017-05-22 14:31:22	arij	its about if im going to meet up with her or no at this point
2017-05-22 14:31:23	cdsboy	I don't know why anyone thinks open relationships work though
2017-05-22 14:31:33	abbyaha	i would def get too jealous in an open relationship
2017-05-22 14:31:44	Roxas	im far too jealous of a person to allow a 3rd party to be part of my relationship
2017-05-22 14:31:53	abbyaha	sam
2017-05-22 14:31:54	cdsboy	I've never met or talked to someone in a successful open relationship lasting longer than 2yr
2017-05-22 14:31:54	na_th_an	open relationships == "I want to fuck other people but you can only fuck me"
2017-05-22 14:31:55	abbyaha	e
2017-05-22 14:32:04	cdsboy	abbyaha: I'd get extremely jealous in an open relationship.

2017-05-22 14:32:31	cdsboy	na_th_an: "I want to have sex with other people but you can't" isn't an open relationship it's an abusive relationship
2017-05-22 14:32:37	abbyaha	^^^^^
2017-05-22 14:32:44	zekkin	but that's generally what every open relationship ends up being

2017-05-22 15:10:25	Berzerker	ok
2017-05-22 15:10:28	cdsboy	Like, how do you hit a consensus for a fork?
2017-05-22 15:10:29	Berzerker	what are you asking
2017-05-22 15:10:40	Berzerker	gotta hit it wit da fork
2017-05-22 15:10:50	arij	no
2017-05-22 15:10:54	arij	you dont have to fork to make changes

2017-05-22 15:11:07	cdsboy	arij: That's why I'm asking.
2017-05-22 15:11:14	arij	whatever Berzerker your days are numbered here
2017-05-22 15:11:18	 *	arij waves goodbye
2017-05-22 15:11:42	cdsboy	arij: So, SegWit requires a soft fork right?
2017-05-22 15:12:16	arij	ya, softfork
2017-05-22 15:12:36	cdsboy	Right, and those are triggered with either an MASF or a UASF right?
2017-05-22 15:12:39	abbyaha	what about a brittlefork
2017-05-22 15:12:51	Berzerker	paltryfork
2017-05-22 15:12:57	arij	there are other ways, but those two are the most likely
2017-05-22 15:13:13	cdsboy	The other ways shake consumer confidence right?
2017-05-22 15:13:18	arij	ya
2017-05-22 15:13:25	cdsboy	Right, so they're not really viable in a mass adopted system
2017-05-22 15:13:36	abbyaha	tbh i dnt understand money
2017-05-22 15:13:49	na_th_an	we know abbyaha
2017-05-22 15:14:02	abbyaha	like why do we need it
2017-05-22 15:14:12	cdsboy	So, since miners are stone walling SegWit they're going with UASF, but how do we do that in a widely adopted system with non-techinical consumers making up the majority of the population?
2017-05-22 15:14:12	abbyaha	if no one required money it wouldnt be a thing
2017-05-22 15:14:27	na_th_an	because not everyone needs someone to do coding for them
2017-05-22 15:14:27	abbyaha	i dont get it
2017-05-22 15:14:31	na_th_an	but i still want their pizzas
2017-05-22 15:14:43	na_th_an	so i work for a universal resource that we can all trade
2017-05-22 15:14:56	na_th_an	and exchange for the resources you own
2017-05-22 15:15:00	cdsboy	na_th_an: well, in reality pretty much everyone needs something coded; they just don't realize it
2017-05-22 15:15:06	cdsboy	;)
2017-05-22 15:15:10	na_th_an	cdsboy: they won't pay for it tho :p
2017-05-22 15:15:17	na_th_an	besides, coding is the easy part
2017-05-22 15:15:21	na_th_an	it's the support and training that's hard
2017-05-22 15:15:23	abbyaha	but if no one charged you for anything and you didnt charge them you could both still do things for each other
2017-05-22 15:15:57	Berzerker	guess what, bitcoins are a plot by the NSA to steal all your information
2017-05-22 15:16:08	na_th_an	that would only work if there were enough resources that everyone can have everything they want
2017-05-22 15:16:19	na_th_an	the point is that there's nothing that mama mimi's wants me to do for them
2017-05-22 15:16:23	na_th_an	i have no trade i can give them
2017-05-22 15:16:25	na_th_an	but i want their pizza
2017-05-22 15:16:29	cdsboy	abbyaha: that works great in a post scarcity society
2017-05-22 15:16:54	na_th_an	there are a limited number of resources in society, they have to be distributed somehow
2017-05-22 15:17:15	Berzerker	I would imagine forks occur for similar reasons of why stock splits occur
2017-05-22 15:17:37	abbyaha	idk i still dont get it if i think too hard about it
2017-05-22 15:17:48	Berzerker	increase/decrease trading volume, etc.
2017-05-22 15:17:48	na_th_an	why
2017-05-22 15:19:03	cdsboy	abbyaha: the answer is scarcity. We can't provide everything everyone wants.
2017-05-22 15:19:21	abbyaha	hmm, fair enough

2017-05-22 15:19:53	Berzerker	which you can't do right now, so
2017-05-22 15:20:15	Berzerker	cdsboy: you should buy a share of berkshire hathaway

2017-05-22 15:26:16	arij	Berzerker: how is bitcoin a fake economy
2017-05-22 15:26:22	arij	what do you even mean by that
2017-05-22 15:26:32	arij	the statement literally makes no sense
2017-05-22 15:26:59	na_th_an	but who was satoshi tho
2017-05-22 15:27:13	arij	doesnt matter

2017-05-22 15:28:12	na_th_an	if it were discovered that bitcoin was really a creation of the nsa public trust would plummet

2017-05-23 02:19:57	switchy	quick, kill him and get the secrets to immortality
2017-05-23 02:25:51	switchy	slaytaner, guix has guix edit
2017-05-23 02:25:55	switchy	I think this seems way better than nix
2017-05-23 02:26:01	switchy	except for the not being able to bootstrap thing
2017-05-23 02:33:48	slaytaner	switchy bumble won't let me upload photos
2017-05-23 02:34:30	switchy	uh-oh
2017-05-23 02:34:31	switchy	why not?
2017-05-23 02:34:37	slaytaner	no idea
2017-05-23 02:36:12	slaytaner	probs too ugly
2017-05-23 02:37:03	switchy	heh
2017-05-23 02:38:43	switchy	slaytaner, make guix work
2017-05-23 02:39:11	slaytaner	is that like hurd
2017-05-23 02:39:12	switchy	install ubuntu 16.04 in a vm and tell me how to get guix going without root
2017-05-23 02:39:18	switchy	no, guix is like nix
2017-05-23 02:39:25	switchy	but with guile scheme instead of their crazy stupid derivation language
2017-05-23 02:39:39	switchy	and nicer cli tools
2017-05-23 02:39:42	slaytaner	isn't nix like haskell
2017-05-23 02:39:50	switchy	the language?
2017-05-23 02:39:56	switchy	kind of but not reallpy
2017-05-23 02:40:35	switchy	it has some semantics similar to haskell
2017-05-23 02:40:40	switchy	but it's also fairly different
2017-05-23 02:41:51	slaytaner	switchy why not root
2017-05-23 02:42:30	switchy	slaytaner, I don't have root
2017-05-23 02:42:33	switchy	it's a shared machine
2017-05-23 02:43:00	slaytaner	uh
2017-05-23 02:43:22	slaytaner	well you're probs fucked
2017-05-23 02:43:30	switchy	?
2017-05-23 02:43:33	switchy	why
2017-05-23 02:43:35	switchy	it should be able to work
2017-05-23 02:43:45	slaytaner	*should*
2017-05-23 02:44:30	switchy	nix mostly worked except for the libtiff stuff
2017-05-23 02:44:33	switchy	then I couldn't be bothered to fix it
2017-05-23 02:44:38	switchy	that was just nix working as expected though
2017-05-23 02:44:45	switchy	super hard to change derivations
2017-05-23 02:46:42	slaytaner	is that a fail from the maintainers switchy
2017-05-23 02:47:04	switchy	I think it's just bad design
2017-05-23 02:47:09	switchy	like it's all really convoluted
2017-05-23 02:47:19	switchy	well, yes the libtiff thing is a fail from the maintainers
2017-05-23 02:47:41	switchy	they're using a debian patchset, and debian actively removes old patches from their mirrors
2017-05-23 02:47:55	switchy	so nix is pointing to an outdated patchset, which 404s and then it doesn't build
2017-05-23 02:48:15	switchy	and the way they've defined using the patchset seems hard to "override" (which they don't even explain very well in the manual)=
2017-05-23 02:48:33	slaytaner	open an issue?
2017-05-23 02:48:53	switchy	nah, I want (need) to be able to do this stuff easily myself
2017-05-23 02:49:08	slaytaner	docker
2017-05-23 02:49:13	switchy	> no root
2017-05-23 02:49:15	slaytaner	lolol
2017-05-23 02:49:34	slaytaner	find a priv esc bug
2017-05-23 02:49:44	switchy	heh
2017-05-23 02:49:51	switchy	I think one of the ones that was around at some point would've worked
2017-05-23 02:49:59	switchy	but also if I actually super *need* something I can probably just ask
2017-05-23 02:50:10	slaytaner	I am become root installer of package managers
2017-05-23 02:50:10	switchy	but I also don't need docker, I just need a way of maintaining my own toolset
2017-05-23 02:50:20	switchy	I was doing it manually for a while but that sucks=
2017-05-23 02:50:38	switchy	linuxbrew seems to be the best solution for the moment, but sometimes it has a few issues because it's osx-focused
2017-05-23 02:51:26	tr4656_	*macOS
2017-05-23 02:51:31	slaytaner	lol
2017-05-23 02:51:33	switchy	yeah that thing
2017-05-23 02:53:52	slaytaner	idk I don't think I could live without root
2017-05-23 02:54:29	switchy	you seem to be doing pretty well

2017-05-23 15:59:35	na_th_an	C# is a good language

2017-05-23 16:03:23	slaytaner	C# is as bad as java
2017-05-23 16:03:50	slaytaner	well maybe a tiny bit less bad since M$ is a tiny bit better than oracle

2017-05-23 16:03:57	na_th_an	and C# is a better language
2017-05-23 16:04:05	na_th_an	the generics are better in c#
2017-05-23 16:04:25	na_th_an	it also has that one query language that people like
2017-05-23 16:04:25	slaytaner	less about the language, more about the corps behind them
2017-05-23 16:04:43	na_th_an	oracle is at least hated by java programmers
2017-05-23 16:04:51	na_th_an	don't think you can say the same about most C# programmers :p
2017-05-23 16:05:13	slaytaner	is there anyone that actually likes oracle

2017-05-23 23:35:00	tr4656_	wut
2017-05-23 23:35:31	slaytaner	massdrop doesn't collect tax in texas
2017-05-23 23:35:42	switchy	rip
2017-05-23 23:36:05	slaytaner	technically you're supposed to pay the comptroller the tax on online orders
2017-05-23 23:36:50	tr4656_	isnt that only if they have warehouse in the state
2017-05-23 23:36:56	slaytaner	where the seller doesn't collect tax
2017-05-23 23:37:18	slaytaner	no that's when the state tells the company to
2017-05-23 23:37:43	tr4656_	anyways lucky for you i guess
2017-05-23 23:37:45	slaytaner	if they have a physical presence in the state
2017-05-23 23:37:51	tr4656_	i get taxed by everything except BH/Adorama
2017-05-23 23:37:58	slaytaner	otherwise the consumer is supposed to pay the tax
2017-05-23 23:39:33	arij	tr4656_: what is that thing I won worth
2017-05-23 23:39:44	arij	I lost the rest of the $50
2017-05-23 23:40:03	tr4656_	:(
2017-05-23 23:40:06	tr4656_	I'm not actually sure though
2017-05-23 23:40:49	tr4656_	It depends on the size of the figurine
2017-05-23 23:41:41	tr4656_	I'd guess about 30-40
2017-05-23 23:42:54	arij	oh
2017-05-23 23:43:56	tr4656_	That's generally the case for medium/lower quality figs
2017-05-23 23:44:18	tr4656_	if its better quality, could be 60
2017-05-23 23:44:30	tr4656_	cant imagine its much more than that
2017-05-23 23:44:37	tr4656_	cause the box isn't that big

2017-05-24 10:13:01	SlabDabs	i talked to him about it, just haven't had time to do much since I've been packing for my move

2017-05-24 10:15:34	arij	Does that link work
2017-05-24 10:15:42	SlabDabs	no thumbnail image on Codepen, nopt a huge fan of the splash image either, it's not bad just feels more empty than it should maybe? the jagged edge piece of paper that is a third full and a lot of right write shown, that sleeve even looks further down than the one with the watch to fill space
2017-05-24 10:16:44	SlabDabs	some of the thumbnails are also just meh to me aside from the blank one. looks weird having two of them that stretch out of frame, that and the lorem ipsum on LughLMS
2017-05-24 10:17:02	SlabDabs	I'm also being overly critical since you asked ;)
2017-05-24 10:17:12	abbyaha	yes arij but lol
2017-05-24 10:17:14	abbyaha	good win
2017-05-24 10:17:28	arij	Damn SlabDabs
2017-05-24 10:17:30	SlabDabs	overall I do like it though, basic, shows what people need to know
2017-05-24 10:17:35	arij	You tore it apart
2017-05-24 10:17:55	SlabDabs	yeeepppp
2017-05-24 10:17:56	SlabDabs	haha
2017-05-24 10:18:01	arij	abbyaha: I had to get it into that position
2017-05-24 10:18:15	arij	Took more money than it was worth
2017-05-24 10:18:48	SlabDabs	also torn on saying your a graduate right in the main bio area. it seems like that then becomes part of your persona more than your work itself speaking
2017-05-24 10:18:59	na_th_an	rip keveloper
2017-05-24 10:19:36	SlabDabs	also interesting that you have to click the hyperlinks to get to github and code pen and I don't see anywhere else they are linked
2017-05-24 10:19:45	SlabDabs	oh i guess at the bottom
2017-05-24 10:20:39	abbyaha	do you even like anime arij
2017-05-24 10:20:43	SlabDabs	andd as friendly as "Hand Written by me" can be, might be worth restating your name/branding to help it stick in their minds
2017-05-24 10:20:53	SlabDabs	plus again, I'm just being hyper critical of it right now
2017-05-24 10:21:01	abbyaha	VVVVV crit
2017-05-24 10:21:32	arij	not really
2017-05-24 10:21:34	SlabDabs	that feel when you ask a designer for critiques lol
2017-05-24 10:21:40	arij	just seemed like an easy win at that point
2017-05-24 10:22:02	abbyaha	display her proudly arij
2017-05-24 10:22:13	na_th_an	I need someone to tear apart my code like SlabDabs just did keveloper's design
2017-05-24 10:22:21	arij	na ill probably give it to some one

2017-05-24 10:23:31	SlabDabs	having to explain your code, even to an object like a rubber duck, forces you to think about it differently

2017-05-24 13:54:45	keveloper	SO WHOS EXCITED FOR THAT RMC REMAKE OF MEAN STREAK AT CEDAR POINT
2017-05-24 13:54:47	arij	What happened
2017-05-24 13:54:52	arij	SlabDabs:
2017-05-24 13:55:00	arij	My brother is buying a house rn
2017-05-24 13:55:27	arij	Fk
2017-05-24 13:55:32	arij	Penumbra didn't arrive
2017-05-24 13:58:37	abbyaha	:O
2017-05-24 13:58:59	slaytaner	rip
2017-05-24 13:59:05	slaytaner	houses are skam
2017-05-24 13:59:15	SlabDabs	arij: found a house for sale, got it under contract, paid for various inspections. it then came to light that the seller did not have full legal claim to sell the property, thus delaying potential move in. during this time (month and a half or so) he never even started the paper work to resolve said issues. Then demanded that if I wanted to rent while it was
2017-05-24 13:59:16	SlabDabs	resolved I paid rent to him directly (ignoring my lawyer and his attorney telling him otherwise) and refusing to take the offer that the lawyers came up with. We then decided to cancel the contract and asked for our deposit and inspection fees back, he is now refusing to pay for my inspection fees. So at best at the moment I would get my deposit back, but
2017-05-24 13:59:16	SlabDabs	not my money for 3 inspections, taking a week off work, flying out there last minute, or legal fees. Not including how it has screwed up my potential income and ability to get a house in the future since the loan process put a hard mark on my credit, i'm taking a lower paying job since I assumed I would be paying mortgage amounts (not rent), having to pay to
2017-05-24 13:59:16	SlabDabs	move twice as well as other things.
2017-05-24 14:00:10	SlabDabs	So lower income (making a lower future loan amount), spent money dealing with this (so lower purchasing power), and having to pay to move again after this (lower purchasing power again)
2017-05-24 14:00:48	cdsboy	Wow. That sounds like a nightmare
2017-05-24 14:01:08	SlabDabs	yeah, this has been my last 3 months or so.
2017-05-24 14:01:26	SlabDabs	house should have closed a month and a half ago

2017-05-24 15:13:12	na_th_an	lol
2017-05-24 15:13:14	tr4656_	json is great
2017-05-24 15:13:19	na_th_an	it's ok
2017-05-24 15:13:23	tr4656_	i also think json feed > rss
2017-05-24 15:13:25	keveloper	yeah rly slow down there tr4656_ 
2017-05-24 15:13:32	keveloper	i dont know anything about rss

2017-05-24 15:14:12	keveloper	and xml
2017-05-24 15:14:18	keveloper	xml is ok, programming xml is barf
2017-05-24 15:14:22	tr4656_	&
2017-05-24 15:14:23	tr4656_	^
2017-05-24 15:14:35	na_th_an	I feel like xml isn't that bad and probably has use in statically typed languages like java
2017-05-24 15:14:52	tr4656_	na_th_an: Having stuff to read it is annoying though
2017-05-24 15:14:53	na_th_an	but the tooling is pretty antiquated since nobody uses xml any more
2017-05-24 15:15:09	na_th_an	i don't think json is significantly easier to read than xml
2017-05-24 15:15:18	na_th_an	if you want it to be read by humans, use yaml
2017-05-24 15:15:26	tr4656_	all libraries/languages have it built in at htis point
2017-05-24 15:15:32	tr4656_	xml isn't always
2017-05-24 15:15:36	na_th_an	yeah exactly
2017-05-24 15:16:00	na_th_an	I think XML as a technology has uses that have maybe been forgotten, but the tooling isn't there for it, so even if it does solve problems it might not be the best way to do it
2017-05-24 15:16:23	na_th_an	being able to validate an xml object against a schema and generate statically typed objects from that schema for the statically typed language I'm working in sounds nice

2017-05-25 01:29:36	shrimp	hi
2017-05-25 01:29:52	slaytaner	I thought rallying was a finnish pastime
2017-05-25 01:30:13	shrimp	ye
2017-05-25 01:30:35	shrimp	slaytaner: the tracks on Dirt Rally in Finland are all just hills
2017-05-25 01:30:51	shrimp	and jumps/hills in rallying are bullshit
2017-05-25 01:34:24	slaytaner	porque?
2017-05-25 01:35:34	shrimp	slaytaner: let's say you're going a pretty good speed, co-driver calls "crest jump into left 4"
2017-05-25 01:36:27	shrimp	so, that means that there's a crest, your co-driver recommends jumping the crest instead of braking before the crest, and right after there'll be a medium-low grade turn
2017-05-25 01:36:34	shrimp	so, what do I do?
2017-05-25 01:37:18	shrimp	jump the crest, realize I'm going to literally jump over the turn, crash my car, want to kill my Co-driver
2017-05-25 01:41:03	slaytaner	rip
2017-05-25 01:41:10	slaytaner	also git gud
2017-05-25 01:59:00	shrimp	slaytaner: I can post up good times if I know where the bullshit corners are, but there's like a couple every track
2017-05-25 02:03:19	tr4656_	Is Dirt Rally actually good
2017-05-25 02:06:28	shrimp	tr4656_: yes
2017-05-25 02:06:44	shrimp	tr4656_: it's unforgiving as hell but it's real fun
2017-05-25 02:06:51	tr4656_	What makes it better than other racing games
2017-05-25 02:07:20	shrimp	tr4656_: realism and difficulty
2017-05-25 02:08:10	tr4656_	I mean for realism you play iracing

2017-05-25 10:23:14	keveloper	that is interesting
2017-05-25 10:23:24	keveloper	like on not-a-joke level that is interesting
2017-05-25 10:24:11	na_th_an	so it's an assert
2017-05-25 10:24:13	na_th_an	?
2017-05-25 10:24:20	keveloper	i guess so yeah
2017-05-25 10:24:28	keveloper	but i've never seen assert used like that
2017-05-25 10:24:47	na_th_an	oh well yeah if you're gonna use asserts they should assert all kinds of shit
2017-05-25 10:24:53	na_th_an	either use them liberally or not at all imo
2017-05-25 10:25:40	keveloper	what do you mean liberally
2017-05-25 10:25:47	na_th_an	like
2017-05-25 10:25:49	na_th_an	everywhere possible
2017-05-25 10:25:56	na_th_an	assert that the incoming parameters meet the things you expect
2017-05-25 10:26:02	na_th_an	assert the return values meet the things you expect
2017-05-25 10:26:06	na_th_an	anywhere that something could go wrong
2017-05-25 10:26:10	na_th_an	use asserts
2017-05-25 10:26:16	keveloper	for some reason i didn't know that liberally meant "in large or generous amounts."
2017-05-25 10:26:28	na_th_an	and honestly if you have enough asserts everywhere I think that's better than unit tests
2017-05-25 10:26:35	na_th_an	unit tests don't test how things integrate
2017-05-25 10:26:36	keveloper	i never really use assert in non unit tests but i  kinda want to
2017-05-25 10:27:08	na_th_an	if something changes its contract then you have to go to every unit test that uses its dependency and update it to the new contract and see if it breaks the class under test
2017-05-25 10:27:20	keveloper	na_th_an: lmao the commit "    No one is above the law."
2017-05-25 10:27:29	na_th_an	idk I question the value in unit tests

2017-07-17 16:06:10	arij	whats drafting
2017-07-17 16:06:28	_rubik	You can get intro packs which are made for beginners too. They are usually free-10 dollars.
2017-07-17 16:06:33	cdsboy	arij: You have 3 booster packs. Everyone opens one pack, takes one card, and passes it to the person next to them
2017-07-17 16:06:40	cdsboy	rinse and repeat until all 3 packs are gone
2017-07-17 16:06:45	cdsboy	then you make a 40 card deck and battle
2017-07-17 16:06:46	arij	oh that sounds cool
2017-07-17 16:06:50	cdsboy	It's a ton of fun.
2017-07-17 16:06:55	arij	but you might have to pass a really good card to some one else

2017-07-17 16:08:00	arij	40 cards= enough to play a game?
2017-07-17 16:08:00	cdsboy	arij: 3 packs = 45 cards
2017-07-17 16:08:10	cdsboy	arij: The card shop provides lands
2017-07-17 16:08:14	arij	ahhh i see
2017-07-17 16:08:16	cdsboy	You general do 23 cards 17 lands
2017-07-17 16:08:21	_rubik	no. 3 packs = 45 cards. You try to make a 40 card deck with ~24 of those cards.
2017-07-17 16:08:26	arij	i see
2017-07-17 16:08:28	cdsboy	So, the idea is to try and pick around 23 cards out of your 45 that play well together
2017-07-17 16:08:31	arij	ill have to call and see if they have it
2017-07-17 16:08:35	arij	but i want girls to be there too

2017-07-17 16:09:08	cdsboy	A fair number of girls play the game according to wizards
2017-07-17 16:09:14	cdsboy	but they generally don't play competitively

2017-07-17 16:11:41	arij	then would you guys play with me
2017-07-17 16:11:49	cdsboy	slaytaner: It really varies quite wildly between formats and stores
2017-07-17 16:12:04	cdsboy	There are girls who play modern and legacy at the store I frequent and don't have any problems
2017-07-17 16:12:16	cdsboy	However, this shop is no-nonsense
2017-07-17 16:12:17	slaytaner	*competitive*
2017-07-17 16:12:42	cdsboy	This store is competitive :P I'm talking competitive REL
2017-07-17 16:13:18	cdsboy	Unless you're talking like pro tour, that's absolutely an old boys club
2017-07-17 16:13:19	_rubik	arij: Get mtgo
2017-07-17 16:13:31	cdsboy	mtgo is so expensive >.>
2017-07-17 16:13:32	_rubik	arij: You can play magic with us online for like 10 bucks
2017-07-17 16:13:38	cdsboy	I don't even want to talk about how much my online collection is worth
2017-07-17 16:13:46	_rubik	cdsboy: Not if you play pauper :)
2017-07-17 16:14:10	_rubik	cdsboy: My pauper decks range from 4 dollars to 30. 30 being tier 1 affinity
2017-07-17 16:14:19	cdsboy	_rubik: my problem is every time I try to mtgo and not do it expensive is I always end up with multiple legacy decks
2017-07-17 16:14:31	cdsboy	Then I freak out and cash out of mtgo
2017-07-17 16:14:39	cdsboy	rinse and repeat ever 12 months
2017-07-17 16:14:43	cdsboy	every*
2017-07-17 16:14:48	cdsboy	ask Slasher
2017-07-17 16:14:51	cdsboy	he's watched me do it twice
2017-07-17 16:15:19	arij	really
2017-07-17 16:15:29	arij	is magic just 1v1 or can we play as a group
2017-07-17 16:15:38	cdsboy	Both, but multiplayer kinda sucks on mtgo
2017-07-17 16:15:41	arij	oh
2017-07-17 16:15:46	arij	does it suck irl as well?
2017-07-17 16:15:48	_rubik	Yooooooooooo beyblades league
2017-07-17 16:16:00	cdsboy	arij: Some people really love multiplayer magic irl
2017-07-17 16:16:07	slaytaner	it's all terrible
2017-07-17 16:16:14	arij	so $10 for the game. im guessing i need to buy cards too?
2017-07-17 16:16:15	cdsboy	EDH/commander is a very very popular multiplayer format
2017-07-17 16:16:18	arij	whats this going to cost me realistically
2017-07-17 16:16:24	cdsboy	arij: for pauper: $60
2017-07-17 16:16:26	slaytaner	thousands

2017-07-17 16:16:49	Slasher	kek
2017-07-17 16:16:56	_rubik	cdsboy: I got my first pauper deck with the 10 tickets they gave me on signup
2017-07-17 16:17:10	cdsboy	_rubik: let's be honest, arij is the kind of person who plays the best netdeck
2017-07-17 16:17:12	_rubik	a nice little 10 ticket dredge that could hold its own.
2017-07-17 16:17:18	_rubik	cdsboy: lol tru

2017-07-17 16:18:30	cdsboy	it's not quite pay to win
2017-07-17 16:18:44	cdsboy	_rubik: yeah, but it's next to impossible to play together in a sealed league
2017-07-17 16:18:49	cdsboy	I think it's actually $24
2017-07-17 16:19:00	arij	you guys play often?

2017-07-17 16:21:51	cdsboy	I didn't buy them for $350 tho
2017-07-17 16:21:56	arij	did you buy them or did you open them in decks
2017-07-17 16:21:57	cdsboy	I've had them for about 2 years, they've gone up in value
2017-07-17 16:21:58	arij	tell the truth
2017-07-17 16:22:02	cdsboy	bought them
2017-07-17 16:22:08	cdsboy	$200-230 each
2017-07-17 16:22:09	arij	oh but when they were cheaper

2017-07-17 16:22:30	cdsboy	arij: last time it was printed was in the early 90s.
2017-07-17 16:22:37	cdsboy	card is almost as old as I am.
2017-07-17 16:22:38	arij	oh

2017-07-17 16:23:02	Slasher	93

2017-07-17 16:25:51	cdsboy	magic can be as cheap or as expensive as you want it to
2017-07-17 16:26:01	cdsboy	in the past 3 years I've probably spend $12000 on it >.>
2017-07-17 16:26:43	slaytaner	rip
2017-07-17 16:26:44	_rubik	Dual lands are like ... liquid jesus gold
2017-07-17 16:27:33	cdsboy	_rubik: go to a legacy tournament, it's really insane how casually people toss around thousand dollar decks
2017-07-17 16:28:09	_rubik	cdsboy: Yeah I'm going to stick to sealed and legacy
2017-07-17 16:28:19	_rubik	standard**
2017-07-17 16:28:22	slaytaner	is legacy basically who can design the most broken deck
2017-07-17 16:28:31	cdsboy	slaytaner: no not really
2017-07-17 16:28:48	cdsboy	slaytaner: There's "gatekeeper" cards in legacy that stop thing from becoming truely busted
2017-07-17 16:28:51	arij	cdsboy: should i do 'play free trial
2017-07-17 16:28:55	arij	or just pay
2017-07-17 16:28:55	_rubik	slaytaner: Its who can build the most expensive deck from a time where cards where easy to cast and broken as hell
2017-07-17 16:29:08	cdsboy	arij: just spend the $10 for an account. It gets you a few free intro drafts and stuff
2017-07-17 16:29:21	cdsboy	You'll get a few hours out of the $10
2017-07-17 16:29:22	slaytaner	that's lame
2017-07-17 16:29:35	cdsboy	_rubik: that's not true :P
2017-07-17 16:29:59	cdsboy	I anticipate losing to a deck that's $2k cheaper than mine tonight.
2017-07-17 16:30:14	slaytaner	what's the point of having gamebreaking cards if you can't use them to win
2017-07-17 16:30:27	_rubik	I know I know. It's really a game of archtypes and game knowledge
2017-07-17 16:30:43	cdsboy	slaytaner: It really depends on what you mean by broken.
2017-07-17 16:30:44	_rubik	But some cards are busted......
2017-07-17 16:30:49	cdsboy	You can play degenerate combo decks
2017-07-17 16:30:59	cdsboy	But you have to contend with control decks
2017-07-17 16:31:17	cdsboy	So, take belcher for example. It aims to win the game on turn one by doing what's essentially a hand check on the opponent
2017-07-17 16:31:31	_rubik	cdsboy: You can't tell me that overrun + a tapped board state isn't broken
2017-07-17 16:31:33	cdsboy	If they have a counterspell you lose, otherwise you play 10-20 cards on turn one and win
2017-07-17 16:32:14	_rubik	cdsboy: also...... overrun reprint in HOU...
2017-07-17 16:32:51	cdsboy	_rubik: you'd like this https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/441493#paper is you like tapping and overrun

2017-07-17 16:35:12	arij	oh
2017-07-17 16:35:13	cdsboy	(a lot bigger of a deal then it sounds like)
2017-07-17 16:35:21	cdsboy	it also stacks
2017-07-17 16:35:29	_rubik	cdsboy: ehhh Deathrite has a lot of fun combos.
2017-07-17 16:35:45	slaytaner	is there a deck that's just bullshit rng

2017-07-17 16:37:28	_rubik	Youre good to get recked, but itll be a good way to learn
2017-07-17 16:37:30	cdsboy	The easiest way to start playing constructed is to go look at the pauper meta _rubik just linked, pick a deck that sounds good, and buy those cards
2017-07-17 16:37:43	arij	but i have over 1500 cards already
2017-07-17 16:37:50	arij	do i really need to buy more?
2017-07-17 16:37:54	arij	to start?
2017-07-17 16:38:01	_rubik	Yeah a lot of the cards are trash
2017-07-17 16:38:05	cdsboy	I have no idea what those cards contain
2017-07-17 16:38:12	arij	can you log into my account and set it up for me
2017-07-17 16:38:18	arij	ill trade you some good cards
2017-07-17 16:38:23	_rubik	cdsboy: its honestly just draft chaff from M15-> HOU
2017-07-17 16:38:27	cdsboy	_rubik: ah
2017-07-17 16:39:00	_rubik	cdsboy: There is some decent stuff. Its essentially a Deck Builders toolkit. Cards, but nothing you can actually build a deck with
2017-07-17 16:39:45	_rubik	arij: I would recommend a Mono Green Stompy. Easy to learn with
2017-07-17 16:39:47	slaytaner	arij is in over his head
2017-07-17 16:40:08	cdsboy	^^
2017-07-17 16:40:09	arij	maybe if one of you have time later i can give you my account info and you can fix my deck for me? ill send you whichever cards you want to keep

2017-07-17 16:40:38	_rubik	no
2017-07-17 16:40:44	cdsboy	They're not random cards
2017-07-17 16:40:46	cdsboy	iirc
2017-07-17 16:40:59	_rubik	You may? But nothing to bring to the bank.

2017-07-17 16:45:35	_rubik	Sort by rarity. Look for any rares and mythics. Check the prices on those.
2017-07-17 16:46:38	_rubik	cdsboy: Wulp 1 hour to be outbid on RTR.
2017-07-17 16:47:10	arij	oh you have to add manually to mtgofish
2017-07-17 16:47:38	slaytaner	arij why don't you buy the houston rockets instead
2017-07-17 16:47:46	arij	ipoor
2017-07-17 16:47:56	_rubik	That would be cheaper than magic
2017-07-17 16:49:11	_rubik	But then again. A night drafting is cheaper than a night drinking...
2017-07-17 16:49:54	cdsboy	arij: you don't actually have to manually add your collection to mtggoldfish for online
2017-07-17 16:49:58	cdsboy	there's an import process
2017-07-17 16:50:01	arij	oh
2017-07-17 16:50:18	arij	i should probably just do some research when i get home fromw ork
2017-07-17 16:50:26	cdsboy	that's probably the best route
2017-07-17 16:50:37	arij	and i can play against randos online right?
2017-07-17 16:50:56	cdsboy	yes
2017-07-17 16:50:58	arij	nice
2017-07-17 16:51:04	cdsboy	That's largely what I do
2017-07-17 16:51:12	slaytaner	how many dollars is a ticket
2017-07-17 16:51:17	cdsboy	slaytaner: roughly $1
2017-07-17 16:51:32	slaytaner	that is too many dollars
2017-07-17 16:51:36	cdsboy	for all intents and purposes except selling tickets outright it's $1
2017-07-17 16:52:48	arij	tickets for what?
2017-07-17 16:53:30	slaytaner	the wizards site broke my chrome
2017-07-17 16:53:43	arij	also i have a waterman flexnib waiting for me in my mailbox... so excited to fill it up and use it 😃)
2017-07-17 16:53:49	slaytaner	anyway D&D is the best wizards game
2017-07-17 16:53:58	cdsboy	arij: event tickets is what you use to enter events online and the defacto currency for trades
2017-07-17 16:54:02	cdsboy	s/is/are/
2017-07-17 16:54:02	magic_conch	cdsboy meant to say: arij: event tickets are what you use to enter events online and the defacto currency for trades
2017-07-17 16:54:05	arij	oh
2017-07-17 16:54:15	arij	can i win anything from an event
2017-07-17 16:54:21	arij	are we playing for decks or what
2017-07-17 16:54:35	cdsboy	Depending on the event you win play points, booster packs, and/or treasure chests
2017-07-17 16:55:05	cdsboy	If you played in a pauper league (5 rounds with your deck) you'd be playing for play points and treasure chests
2017-07-17 16:55:17	cdsboy	play points are non-tradeable tickets to enter more events
2017-07-17 16:55:28	cdsboy	treasure checks are tradeable chests with cards/points in them
2017-07-17 16:55:45	arij	ohh
2017-07-17 16:55:50	cdsboy	it's usually better to trade treasure chests for event tickets than it is to open them
2017-07-17 16:56:14	cdsboy	play points are hard to cash out of, your main option is to use them for drafts to keep the cards you open in the draft

2017-07-17 18:36:56	arij	and better than both my other two flex pens
2017-07-17 18:37:04	arij	one is a noodlers nib creeper which smells
2017-07-17 18:37:13	arij	and the other is a twsbi vac mini that i put a flexnib on
2017-07-17 18:37:33	arij	vintage is so good, cant even compare to the new ones
2017-07-17 18:37:45	tr4656_	What flex nib is on the  TWSBI?
2017-07-17 18:37:55	tr4656_	But I expected that from the Noodler's

2017-08-01 15:39:05	keveloper	cdsboy: that'd be pretty easy to make
2017-08-01 15:40:32	keveloper	1) buy silicon buttplug, 2) take of bearing cap on fidget spinner, 3) drill hole into end of buttplug, 4) put a well fitting bolt through the fidget spinner and into the buttplug hole, 5) put a washer and nut on the end of the bolt to hold the fidget spinner in place, 6) place in butt, 7) spine for days
2017-08-01 15:40:55	keveloper	spin*
2017-08-01 15:41:09	_rubik	spin your spine
2017-08-01 15:41:25	keveloper	someone lmk when you've made a fidget spinner butt plug
2017-08-01 15:42:46	na_th_an	keveloper: I'd have just superglued the fidget spinner to the plug but that works to
2017-08-01 15:42:59	na_th_an	that way you can do metal on metal
2017-08-01 15:43:06	keveloper	na_th_an: oh true i always forget about super glue
2017-08-01 15:43:11	na_th_an	quality fidget butt plug
2017-08-01 15:43:14	na_th_an	super glue is the shit
2017-08-01 15:43:24	na_th_an	gorilla superglue gel is the best
2017-08-01 15:43:33	keveloper	omg
2017-08-01 15:43:35	keveloper	i found one on etsy
2017-08-01 15:43:50	keveloper	LOL
2017-08-01 15:43:55	keveloper	na_th_an: it's exactly what you said
2017-08-01 15:43:56	keveloper	LOLOL
2017-08-01 15:44:00	keveloper	abbyaha: come here
2017-08-01 15:45:28	na_th_an	are you looking at buttplugs at work
2017-08-01 15:45:33	cdsboy	^^^^
2017-08-01 15:46:15	abbyaha	(yes)
2017-08-01 15:46:28	na_th_an	so there were 45 ratings on that
2017-08-01 15:46:38	keveloper	lol we good LTE/incognito and no one is around
2017-08-01 15:46:53	na_th_an	doing it on your phone is a lot better than your work computer
2017-08-01 15:47:03	na_th_an	also since it's on etsy it won't fuck up your amazon recommendations
2017-08-01 15:47:13	keveloper	i just googled lo,
2017-08-01 15:55:41	_rubik	Wow... it literally is what I expected
2017-08-01 15:55:58	_rubik	But if you got a big booty, wouldnt that not spin?
2017-08-01 15:56:22	na_th_an	lay on your back and bring your ankles to your head
2017-08-01 15:56:24	na_th_an	it'll probably work
2017-08-01 15:57:47	_rubik	yall need jesus

2017-08-01 16:02:34	keveloper	gotta get that spin time up yanno
2017-08-01 16:04:10	na_th_an	it'd be cool if they had one that you could pump with your butt mucles
2017-08-01 16:04:18	na_th_an	and as you pump air out it makes it spin faster
2017-08-01 16:04:25	na_th_an	so you can use your butt muscles to keep it spinning
2017-08-01 16:04:27	keveloper	na_th_an: LLOLOLOLOLOL
2017-08-01 16:05:01	na_th_an	it'd be a good couple's activity
2017-08-01 16:06:27	keveloper	it could be a double sided dildo with spinner next to each end
2017-08-01 16:06:36	keveloper	and you gotta pump yours faster
2017-08-01 16:06:49	keveloper	there could be RPM monitors in the middle
2017-08-01 16:07:02	na_th_an	there's a market for this I bet
2017-08-01 16:07:07	na_th_an	chaturbate stremaers
2017-08-01 16:07:14	na_th_an	we need to get on the ground floor
2017-08-01 16:07:44	keveloper	i made a drawing if you wanna see
2017-08-01 16:08:39	cdsboy	donate to spin~
2017-08-01 16:09:00	keveloper	omg
2017-08-01 16:09:08	keveloper	it could have a motor
2017-08-01 16:09:16	keveloper	and its a smart device
2017-08-01 16:09:24	keveloper	so when people donate it can automatically spin
2017-08-01 16:09:38	keveloper	okay but really is there a smart fucking machine where when you donate it spins
2017-08-01 16:09:40	keveloper	that HAS to be a thing
2017-08-01 16:09:54	na_th_an	I bet that's how the chaturbate vibrators work
2017-08-01 16:10:00	na_th_an	spinning an unbalanced motor
2017-08-01 16:10:12	cdsboy	That's how most vibrators work isn't it?
2017-08-01 16:10:27	na_th_an	there's another kind that involves moving a thing back and forth
2017-08-01 16:10:30	na_th_an	the new iphones use it
2017-08-01 16:10:37	cdsboy	Ah
2017-08-01 16:10:39	abbyaha	vibrator technologu
2017-08-01 16:11:14	cdsboy	keveloper: there is a vibrator that chaturbate supports that vibrates when people donate
2017-08-01 16:11:16	keveloper	there are smart vibrators for chaturbate??
2017-08-01 16:11:21	keveloper	cdsboy: no wayyy 
2017-08-01 16:11:22	na_th_an	keveloper: yes
2017-08-01 16:11:24	cdsboy	I can't remember the name of it, but a ton of cam girls use it
2017-08-01 16:11:29	na_th_an	chaturbate sells them
2017-08-01 16:11:33	keveloper	as they watch the $$$$$$ roll in
2017-08-01 16:11:36	na_th_an	when they get a donation it vibrates harder
2017-08-01 16:11:45	na_th_an	and they're like "aahhhhh yeaaaaa thank you"
2017-08-01 16:11:49	keveloper	lololol

2017-08-01 16:13:05	keveloper	i wonder how much money you can make form that
2017-08-01 16:13:23	cdsboy	Some of these girls make bank

2017-08-01 16:32:47	cdsboy	Would've found it flattering if he wasn't sooo pushy
2017-08-01 16:33:06	cdsboy	I was like "Dude, I'm just here having a drink in between rounds of magic, not looking for anything more tonight"
2017-08-01 16:33:20	cdsboy	(gay bar is right across the street from the magic shop)
2017-08-01 16:37:28	slaytaner	rip

2017-08-01 16:53:44	cdsboy	I wouldn't feel anything about it because I'd be dead :P

2017-08-01 16:55:32	cdsboy	wow sunset has shitty internet
2017-08-01 16:56:01	noordinaryspider	why you tracing my IP dude?
2017-08-01 16:56:07	cdsboy	noordinaryspider: I'd imagine my response to someone attempting to kill me because they thought I was icky would be pretty close to a spider's as well
2017-08-01 16:56:07	noordinaryspider	nah i dont have bad internet
2017-08-01 16:56:21	noordinaryspider	it just goes on and off
2017-08-01 16:56:55	noordinaryspider	cdsboy: yeh. so don't kill 'em. they're living too. they have lives and they feel pain.
2017-08-01 16:57:33	cdsboy	noordinaryspider: eh, from what I understand spiders do not form emotional attachment to other spiders, so as far my conscience goes as long as I make it a swift end we're all good
2017-08-01 16:57:47	noordinaryspider	nope
2017-08-01 16:57:49	noordinaryspider	ur wrong
2017-08-01 16:57:55	noordinaryspider	they have emotions
2017-08-01 16:57:59	noordinaryspider	but how can you tell?
2017-08-01 16:58:22	noordinaryspider	i know for a fact Spiders are heart broken when someone kills, for example their brother
2017-08-01 16:58:32	noordinaryspider	but they don't show it. or if they do we just can't see it
2017-08-01 16:58:42	noordinaryspider	because we're used to detecting human emotions
2017-08-01 16:58:47	cdsboy	Who do you know for a fact?
2017-08-01 16:58:50	cdsboy	how*
2017-08-01 16:59:37	noordinaryspider	because they're not dumb
2017-08-01 16:59:44	noordinaryspider	they may have tiny brains but they make use of them
2017-08-01 17:00:15	cdsboy	So you've come to a conclusion without empirical evidence?

2017-08-02 12:54:42	abbyaha	do it do it do it
2017-08-02 13:02:42	_rubik	zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzz zzzz z
2017-08-02 13:02:47	_rubik	thats the sound of it spinning
2017-08-02 13:03:13	_rubik	boutta take off if I go too fast. Watch out
2017-08-02 13:33:32	_rubik	cdsboy: You never answered, why don't you like edh?
2017-08-02 13:34:03	cdsboy	_rubik: You never asked me why I don't like edh?
2017-08-02 13:34:28	cdsboy	There's a number of reasons though
2017-08-02 13:34:34	_rubik	>> 09:38:59      _rubik | cdsboy: and why is that?
2017-08-02 13:35:01	cdsboy	_rubik: that line is not in my logs, nor do I have any indication of me losing connection
2017-08-02 13:35:13	cdsboy	anyway
2017-08-02 13:35:22	_rubik	Clearly we've entered the twilight zone
2017-08-02 13:35:28	_rubik	anyway
2017-08-02 13:35:43	cdsboy	I don't enjoy multiplayer games because I do not enjoy the politics of it
2017-08-02 13:35:53	cdsboy	so, that part of edh is a no-go zone by default
2017-08-02 13:35:56	_rubik	cdsboy: There is 1v1
2017-08-02 13:36:21	cdsboy	I don't think the commander mechanic is very interesting
2017-08-02 13:36:36	cdsboy	I don't find 100 card singleton an interesting deck building challenge
2017-08-02 13:37:32	_rubik	cdsboy: I disagree. If anything it stretches my brew knowledge.
2017-08-02 13:37:33	cdsboy	I don't like not being able to use all of my cards, but I enjoy players ganging up on me because I own duals even less
2017-08-02 13:37:51	_rubik	^^ That part is true
2017-08-02 13:38:00	_rubik	Granted. I want your duals
2017-08-02 13:38:36	cdsboy	_rubik: All 100 card singleton has ever done for me has made deck building devolve into search gatherer for all the tutors and functional reprints of effects I want
2017-08-02 13:38:49	cdsboy	I'm pretty fucking good at data gathering, so this loses its appeal very quickly
2017-08-02 13:39:21	cdsboy	But most of all, I just don't particularly like playing casually
2017-08-02 13:39:57	cdsboy	I want to be playing against decks of a consistent power level and that's not an experience I have in edh
2017-08-02 13:40:28	cdsboy	Also, I've found that edh games usually end up being very one sided
2017-08-02 13:40:44	cdsboy	with the player who drew their powerful ramp effects and tutors first being the one who wins
2017-08-02 13:40:46	_rubik	ah. See that is where we differ. Im a big fan of casual because I don't always want my modern deck to be blown out of the water by a deck 4 times its price
2017-08-02 13:41:07	_rubik	cdsboy: You have a point there
2017-08-02 13:41:31	cdsboy	When I lose I like to be able to go back and say "why did I lose?"
2017-08-02 13:41:46	cdsboy	and then be able to point to deck construction issues, misplays, and that kind of thing
2017-08-02 13:42:32	cdsboy	not my opponent accelerated into some weird modern legal enchantment and I couldn't draw anything but lands
2017-08-02 13:42:53	_rubik	Fair. Sadly for me its usually "I didn't pay enough"
2017-08-02 13:43:01	_rubik	Side note. What duals do you have
2017-08-02 13:43:28	cdsboy	4 tropical island, 3 underground sea, 3 volcanic island, 3 badlands, 2 bayou, 1 taiga, 1 scrubland
2017-08-02 13:45:19	_rubik	Beta or revised tropical island?
2017-08-02 13:45:29	cdsboy	All revised
2017-08-02 13:46:35	_rubik	Phew. I was about to say.

2017-08-02 14:19:39	na_th_an	it's just something to fuck with while you're bored

2017-08-02 15:50:15	arij	maybe later if you have time?
2017-08-02 15:51:12	na_th_an	uhhh I can help a little tonight maybe
2017-08-02 15:53:50	slaytaner	abbyaha why haven't you stacked the spinner to collapse the universe yet
2017-08-02 15:55:33	na_th_an	we need a larger c-clamp
2017-08-02 15:56:10	slaytaner	get some superglue
2017-08-02 15:56:50	na_th_an	that actually sounds awesome
2017-08-02 15:57:10	na_th_an	if they still have fidget spinners when I leave I might go grab a bunch more and do exactly that
2017-08-02 15:57:22	arij	get a can of air
2017-08-02 15:57:26	arij	to propel the spinner
2017-08-02 15:57:32	arij	it goes so fast
2017-08-02 15:58:03	na_th_an	lemme go buy a small air compressor
2017-08-02 15:58:12	abbyaha	:o
2017-08-02 15:58:24	arij	lol
2017-08-02 15:58:25	slaytaner	use a CO2 fire extinguisher
2017-08-02 15:58:26	arij	or a can of air
2017-08-02 15:59:14	na_th_an	can of air too weak
2017-08-02 15:59:22	na_th_an	I could do the same thing with my foot bellows
2017-08-02 15:59:37	na_th_an	foot bellows > canned air
2017-08-02 15:59:43	arij	what is that
2017-08-02 15:59:58	na_th_an	https://www.amazon.com/Intex-Bellows-Foot-Pump-11-5/dp/B001ANYRGE
2017-08-02 16:01:15	arij	can i use that to dust my keyboard
2017-08-02 16:01:19	arij	is it actually better than canned air
2017-08-02 16:01:20	arij	?
2017-08-02 16:01:36	na_th_an	I mean it takes more effort than pulling a trigger
2017-08-02 16:01:43	na_th_an	but I got tired of paying for canned air
2017-08-02 16:01:50	arij	ya thats what im saying
2017-08-02 16:02:03	na_th_an	I think it has more force
2017-08-02 16:02:09	na_th_an	and I don't have to worry about wasting my canned air
2017-08-02 16:02:16	abbyaha	anned air is cool though
2017-08-02 16:02:21	na_th_an	but yes you can use it to dust your keyboard

2017-08-02 16:13:51	na_th_an	honestly I'd probably soak it in hot salt water for awhile then see if there's dead skin to cut off
2017-08-02 16:13:58	na_th_an	but that's probably not the best route
2017-08-02 16:14:16	Slasher	i should find a pin

2017-08-07 13:20:32	zekkin	but i dont do that anymore
2017-08-07 13:21:34	na_th_an	i've been smoking some weed recently
2017-08-07 13:21:37	na_th_an	not nearly as much as I used to
2017-08-07 13:21:49	na_th_an	i probably won't smoke any today
2017-08-07 13:21:58	na_th_an	and I'll be able to eat without feeling like I want to throw up which is great
2017-08-07 13:22:09	na_th_an	but all I wanna do is rip dabs all day
2017-08-07 13:23:00	zekkin	i'm 100% confident at this point i'd be able to smoke a small bowl in the evening and be very very ok and be able to keep my shit under control
2017-08-07 13:23:04	zekkin	maybe even just on the weekends
2017-08-07 13:23:19	na_th_an	that's basically what I've been doing recently
2017-08-07 13:23:45	na_th_an	but I smoked weed almost every day for like 6 years
2017-08-07 13:23:50	zekkin	i've just exhausted the connections i have here so i'll be a sober duder for the forseeable future

2017-08-08 14:41:05	na_th_an	"it does not exist when a system is described relative to an inertial frame of reference"
2017-08-08 14:41:12	na_th_an	is what I was referring to
2017-08-08 14:42:06	_rubik	Ah yes. In that case the centrifugal force is mistaken for the centripetal
2017-08-08 14:42:22	na_th_an	it's been awhile, but I passed dynamics in college
2017-08-08 14:42:27	na_th_an	then dropped out of mechanical engineering
2017-08-08 14:43:28	_rubik	Meaning, if I'm not mistaken, centrifugal forces do not apply to center of a wheel for example, but do for the tire.

2017-08-09 11:55:07	zekkin	1-24, EoE, rebuilds
2017-08-09 11:55:35	zekkin	some people dont like the rebuilds but they're entertaining and may or may not be directly related to the series
2017-08-09 11:57:36	abbyaha	hey go donate blood
2017-08-09 11:57:45	abbyaha	peeps need some blood

2017-08-09 13:18:50	cdsboy	abbyaha: pfft, you can't convince me to donate blood
2017-08-09 13:21:36	abbyaha	why not

2017-08-09 13:21:57	abbyaha	same
2017-08-09 13:21:58	cdsboy	2) They won't let me donate blood
2017-08-09 13:22:00	abbyaha	aww
2017-08-09 13:22:46	cdsboy	I could like lie and donate blood
2017-08-09 13:23:23	cdsboy	but, it seems pretty silly to think "I'm donating blood for moral reasons" while lying to donate blood
2017-08-09 13:23:39	tr4656_	why don't they let you donate?
2017-08-09 13:24:09	cdsboy	tr4656_: There's a number of different groups of people that they exclude for donating blood for various different reasons and I'm part of one of them :P

2017-08-09 13:25:16	abbyaha	probs one of the dumb reasons
2017-08-09 13:25:34	cdsboy	Nah, most of the reasons they do it is for statistically valid reasons
2017-08-09 13:25:42	cdsboy	regardless of it applies to the individual in question
2017-08-09 13:25:50	cdsboy	donating blood is all a game of stats

2017-08-09 13:57:09	zekkin	no where near that level of data storage
2017-08-09 13:57:13	zekkin	i dont even have redundancy
2017-08-09 13:57:31	na_th_an	i need backup
2017-08-09 13:57:42	na_th_an	i have parity (unraid) but no backup yet
2017-08-09 14:06:23	_rubik	na_th_an: I just took spin through /r/datahoaders.... WHAT THE HELL DO YALLL NEED THAT SPACE FOR?
2017-08-09 14:06:32	na_th_an	linux isos
2017-08-09 14:06:35	na_th_an	I only have 9tb
2017-08-09 14:08:36	_rubik	na_th_an: Ahh. Do you host them anywhere or hoard them for personal use?
2017-08-09 14:08:44	na_th_an	"linux isos"
2017-08-09 14:09:02	na_th_an	they say "linux isos" on that sub when they generally mean "pirated media"
2017-08-09 14:09:35	_rubik	Ah I see.
2017-08-09 14:10:06	na_th_an	some high bitrate movies are like 20+GB so it's not too hard to use the space if you've got it
2017-08-09 14:10:28	na_th_an	especially once you set up automatic downloading with nzb and radarr or a similar system
2017-08-09 14:10:42	_rubik	I have thought of amassing digitial media like that, but my options are either pay or pirate. And I neither want to pay or pirate.

2017-08-09 14:14:15	tr4656_	na_th_an: I need a new box really
2017-08-09 14:14:33	tr4656_	i'm using a NUC for the plex side and a synology with only 5 bays
2017-08-09 14:15:33	tr4656_	I'm currently doing 5x 4TB RAID 5 so only 16TB unforunately
2017-08-09 14:15:53	_rubik	tr4656_: wow why raid 5?
2017-08-09 14:15:56	tr4656_	but i did buy 2 of those EasyShare 8TBs from Beset Buy the other day
2017-08-09 14:16:00	tr4656_	i might shuck them
2017-08-09 14:16:33	tr4656_	Because its what i did at the beginning
2017-08-09 14:17:12	tr4656_	i guess the dream is to go 8x 8tb
2017-08-09 14:18:23	tr4656_	_rubik: Is there a problem with RAID 5 though
2017-08-09 14:19:18	_rubik	I am rusty on my raid. Raid4/5 use the parity drive (where Raid 5's parity disk is distributed), but what is the parity disk used for.
2017-08-09 14:21:08	cdsboy	_rubik: redundancy?
2017-08-09 14:21:44	tr4656_	^
2017-08-09 14:22:09	tr4656_	basically good enough for single drive failures

2017-08-09 14:35:19	_rubik	Let me rephrase, what goes on the parity disk? My raid experience is limited to 1, 0, and 10
2017-08-09 14:35:41	tr4656_	oh man
2017-08-09 14:35:51	tr4656_	do i want to pay $1000 to get a gigabit connection
2017-08-09 14:36:21	_rubik	tr4656_: Per year.. month?... day?
2017-08-09 14:37:49	tr4656_	installation fee

2017-08-09 14:38:13	tr4656_	i have this option and the gigabit connection to my house
2017-08-09 14:38:20	tr4656_	but since I know for  fact theres no fiber here
2017-08-09 14:38:29	tr4656_	they're going to be installing cables like this guy
2017-08-09 14:38:34	tr4656_	and that's like an $1000 fee
2017-08-09 14:39:01	na_th_an	tr4656_: raid5 isn't really recommended any more, especially with larger drives
2017-08-09 14:39:21	_rubik	Ah. I think it would all hinge on what comcast wants monthly for the gigabit connection.
2017-08-09 14:39:23	tr4656_	I know
2017-08-09 14:39:32	tr4656_	But like I said
2017-08-09 14:39:38	tr4656_	I don't want to rebuild
2017-08-09 14:39:38	na_th_an	you totally should shuck those easystores tho
2017-08-09 14:39:43	na_th_an	next time they go on sale that's what I'm going to do
2017-08-09 14:39:58	tr4656_	The main limitation is that I don't have any more space in this Synology
2017-08-09 14:39:59	na_th_an	I'm gonna get one for backup
2017-08-09 14:40:21	tr4656_	_rubik: 100-120/month probably since I'm already a customer
2017-08-09 14:40:23	na_th_an	3x8tb + unraid = transfer all your data :)
2017-08-09 14:40:31	tr4656_	90 for new
2017-08-09 14:41:01	tr4656_	300/month if I go 2gigabit
2017-08-09 14:44:02	_rubik	2gig might not be worth it, but I think 1 may be...
2017-08-09 14:45:35	tr4656_	yeah definitely not
2017-08-09 14:45:47	tr4656_	i'd need new networking equipment too
2017-08-09 14:48:55	_rubik	It certainly is an expensive adventure. You're in SF yeah? How is Comcast customer support out there?
2017-08-09 14:49:55	tr4656_	no that's not quite accurate
2017-08-09 14:50:07	tr4656_	im in the bay but in the suburbs
2017-08-09 14:50:21	Berzerker	2g not worth it
2017-08-09 14:50:23	tr4656_	comcast customer support is what you expect here
2017-08-09 14:50:26	Berzerker	gigabit is worth it if you can get it cheap enough
2017-08-09 14:50:28	Berzerker	we have comcast gigabit
2017-08-09 14:50:32	Berzerker	$70/mo
2017-08-09 14:50:43	tr4656_	Berzerker: I think $100+ a month for sure + $1000 installation fee
2017-08-09 14:50:47	tr4656_	maybe $500 installation fee
2017-08-09 14:50:55	Berzerker	2g is $300/mo
2017-08-09 14:51:03	Berzerker	1g is $70-130/mo
2017-08-09 14:51:04	tr4656_	ye
2017-08-09 14:51:05	Berzerker	depending on market
2017-08-09 14:51:16	Berzerker	but you shouldn't need an installation fee
2017-08-09 14:51:24	tr4656_	i don't have fiber here
2017-08-09 14:51:34	tr4656_	i'm sure of that
2017-08-09 14:51:38	Berzerker	comcast gigabit is fiber to the node
2017-08-09 14:51:43	Berzerker	I'm sure the area's backbone is fiber
2017-08-09 14:51:54	_rubik	tr4656_: I would think being in tech mecca they would try to improve their service.
2017-08-09 14:51:55	Berzerker	they run it over DOCSIS 3.1
2017-08-09 14:52:08	tr4656_	Berzerker: Maybe
2017-08-09 14:52:13	tr4656_	But when I called them up few month ago
2017-08-09 14:52:25	tr4656_	they told me they couldn't do faster than 150
2017-08-09 14:52:35	Berzerker	that just means their equipment hasn't been upgraded
2017-08-09 14:52:41	Berzerker	pretty much the entire country's backbone is fiber
2017-08-09 14:53:15	Berzerker	just has to upgrade the line to go through DOCSIS 3.1
2017-08-09 14:53:17	tr4656_	oh i see
2017-08-09 14:53:21	tr4656_	well, will see what they say
2017-08-09 14:53:28	tr4656_	it's still going to be 130/month i bet
2017-08-09 14:53:39	tr4656_	i have no doubt about that
2017-08-09 14:54:02	Berzerker	probably
2017-08-09 14:54:02	tr4656_	i basically already cycled through all of the people i can use as "new customers"
2017-08-09 14:54:08	Berzerker	it's usually only $70/mo in markets where google fiber is
2017-08-09 14:54:10	Berzerker	or att
2017-08-09 14:54:11	tr4656_	so i would have to upgrade
2017-08-09 14:54:14	tr4656_	haha att
2017-08-09 14:54:21	tr4656_	i can get 10mbps dsl here max
2017-08-09 14:54:24	Berzerker	yeah
2017-08-09 14:54:29	Berzerker	they're installing symmetrical gigabit fiber
2017-08-09 14:54:45	tr4656_	yep
2017-08-09 14:54:52	tr4656_	but they don't have anything here
2017-08-09 14:54:55	tr4656_	because suburbs
2017-08-09 14:55:18	tr4656_	and i'm not like in san jose or cupertino where they would have more customers
2017-08-09 14:55:44	tr4656_	oh well
2017-08-09 14:55:56	tr4656_	oh mistake
2017-08-09 14:56:03	tr4656_	att can only do 5mbps here max
2017-08-09 14:56:05	tr4656_	:/
2017-08-09 14:58:10	na_th_an	I have 100/10 for $40. I really want a 500/50 package they have for $60 but I can't really justify it because only two people use the connection
2017-08-09 14:59:01	tr4656_	na_th_an: I'm paying 65 for 100/10 >:(
2017-08-09 15:01:27	abbyaha	i have the 500/50 package
2017-08-09 15:01:29	abbyaha	its great
2017-08-09 15:02:03	Berzerker	fucking gigabit on comcast is 40 up
2017-08-09 15:02:05	Berzerker	1000/40
2017-08-09 15:02:19	na_th_an	i really just want more upload
2017-08-09 15:02:20	Berzerker	I'd give them back half my download to have a symmetrical connection
2017-08-09 15:02:20	tr4656_	wait seriously
2017-08-09 15:02:22	Berzerker	yes
2017-08-09 15:02:22	na_th_an	100/50 would be great
2017-08-09 15:02:25	tr4656_	haha
2017-08-09 15:02:31	Berzerker	I miss fios
2017-08-09 15:02:33	Berzerker	300/300 was great
2017-08-09 15:02:37	Berzerker	now they have symmetrical gigabit
2017-08-09 15:03:11	_rubik	How much was your symmetrical 300
2017-08-09 15:03:17	tr4656_	fuck comcast
2017-08-09 15:03:26	tr4656_	but whats worse is that its my only option
2017-08-09 15:03:29	Berzerker	with TV it was $160/mo
2017-08-09 15:03:55	tr4656_	oh yeah, i also have to pay a bit more because no tv
2017-08-09 15:03:58	tr4656_	>:(

2017-08-09 15:04:51	tr4656_	although im actually curious why i don't get the comcast overage charge
2017-08-09 15:05:02	_rubik	Berzerker: WAT. I pay 80 bucks to have comcast put me on hold
2017-08-09 15:05:26	Berzerker	_rubik: I seriously miss fios

2017-08-09 15:05:37	tr4656_	but price is insane
2017-08-09 15:05:45	_rubik	Yeah. I need to get out of comcasts shadow asap.

2017-08-09 20:53:54	slaytaner	the magic mouse 2 has the worst design
2017-08-09 20:54:07	slaytaner	I hope whoever came up with that was fired
2017-08-09 21:00:53	tr4656_	Its the same as the magic mouse 1
2017-08-09 21:01:26	tr4656_	I think both are good looking for photos but not great to use
2017-08-09 21:01:39	slaytaner	no it has that stupid lightning port on the bottom
2017-08-09 21:01:54	tr4656_	oh
2017-08-09 21:01:59	tr4656_	but that is not a bad problem
2017-08-09 21:02:07	tr4656_	because of how fast it charges
2017-08-09 21:02:23	slaytaner	I still maintain it's dumb
2017-08-09 21:02:50	tr4656_	i agree it should be in front
2017-08-09 21:03:44	tr4656_	but isn't it an hour or two at most
2017-08-09 21:03:52	tr4656_	for max charge
2017-08-09 21:03:59	tr4656_	and one minute for an hour?
2017-08-09 21:06:17	slaytaner	you still lose your mouse
2017-08-09 21:07:56	tr4656_	That's true
2017-08-09 21:09:09	tr4656_	at least magic trackpad has it in front
2017-08-09 21:09:11	tr4656_	which is what i use
2017-08-09 21:09:34	slaytaner	I kinda want one
2017-08-09 21:09:40	slaytaner	I have the og one though
2017-08-09 21:10:02	slaytaner	and idk if force touch is worth $125

2017-08-09 22:20:16	arij	Is elfin lied nude grillz or something
2017-08-09 22:20:30	slaytaner	occasionally

2017-08-09 22:46:45	tr4656_	well
2017-08-09 22:46:54	slaytaner	it's just dumb
2017-08-09 22:47:09	tr4656_	monogatari works although i'm rewatching that right now haha
2017-08-09 22:47:16	tr4656_	pretty long

2017-08-09 23:02:08	tr4656_	oh wait yeah
2017-08-09 23:02:16	tr4656_	i forgot season one and even current one has a bunch of names
2017-08-09 23:02:51	tr4656_	it's bakemonogatari -> nisemonogatari->nekomonogatari -> monogatari 2nd season which has a bunch of subsections if you can call it that
2017-08-09 23:03:18	tr4656_	there are basically a lot of episodes
2017-08-09 23:03:39	slaytaner	why do they make things so confusing
2017-08-09 23:04:44	tr4656_	i guess you can watch one punch man lol
2017-08-09 23:18:45	slaytaner	I really just want akame ga kill la kill
2017-08-09 23:21:51	slaytaner	good lord the german in blumenkranz

2017-08-09 23:29:34	slaytaner	I think I'm gonna go with the monogatari series
2017-08-09 23:49:47	slaytaner	I might also be the only one who hates mob psycho 100s animation
2017-08-09 23:50:55	slaytaner	and I found asuka more likable than shinji
2017-08-10 00:31:37	tr4656_	Lol
2017-08-10 00:31:52	tr4656_	Do you need my Plex
2017-08-10 00:31:57	slaytaner	I really did not like shinji
2017-08-10 00:32:21	slaytaner	I have the crunchyrolls for a month
2017-08-10 00:32:42	slaytaner	even though whoever designed that site needs to be fired
2017-08-10 00:32:59	tr4656_	Does it have all monogatari
2017-08-10 00:33:15	slaytaner	it has the first one
2017-08-10 00:33:21	slaytaner	bakemonogatari
2017-08-10 00:34:16	slaytaner	so I can see if I like it
2017-08-10 00:35:15	slaytaner	I'll let you know if I can't find something
2017-08-10 00:36:35	slaytaner	someone said evangelion had some of the most realistic characters in anime
2017-08-10 00:37:01	tr4656_	Well I mean re:zero is more like kill la kill
2017-08-10 00:37:06	tr4656_	than bakamonogatari
2017-08-10 00:37:07	slaytaner	because over the top caricatures are totally realistic
2017-08-10 00:39:47	slaytaner	I found it really heavy handed
2017-08-10 00:43:59	slaytaner	tr4656_ I'm not into the plot device of re:zero atm
2017-08-10 00:44:17	tr4656_	anyways if you know what keyboard you want

2017-08-10 11:27:19	_rubik	arij: White hhkb JIS pro 2
2017-08-10 12:08:27	arij	should i get the white one or black one
2017-08-10 12:08:34	arij	i ordered the white one then cancelled it
2017-08-10 12:08:39	arij	now i cant decide which one i want
2017-08-10 12:09:13	abbyaha	what does your heart say
2017-08-10 12:09:22	arij	well i originally ordered the white one
2017-08-10 12:09:26	arij	cause i thought i liked it more
2017-08-10 12:09:36	abbyaha	then i think you had your answer all along
2017-08-10 13:15:32	zekkin	i want a black one
2017-08-10 13:15:43	zekkin	ive been thinking about getting topre for awhile now
2017-08-10 13:16:17	_rubik	are we thinking standard or JIS..
2017-08-10 13:16:22	zekkin	standard
2017-08-10 13:16:30	_rubik	zekkin: I would start with RF87u
2017-08-10 13:16:35	zekkin	no thanks
2017-08-10 13:16:44	zekkin	realforce branding is ugly as fuck
2017-08-10 13:16:44	_rubik	WAT
2017-08-10 13:16:48	_rubik	They are so well made
2017-08-10 13:16:51	zekkin	and i dont need a TKL
2017-08-10 13:17:35	_rubik	I will say that 45g is a disappointing weight for topre. 55g is the minimum for me.
2017-08-10 13:17:55	_rubik	Other than that, having a metal plate is much nicer than hhkb's plastic case/plate ordeal
2017-08-10 13:18:09	zekkin	cool
2017-08-10 13:18:15	zekkin	still not getting realforce
2017-08-10 13:18:31	_rubik	Whats the reasoning beside tkl?
2017-08-10 13:20:14	zekkin	i want to try topre and i want an hhkb
2017-08-10 13:28:07	arij	zekkin i can help you buy a hhkb for $180 shipped to the us
2017-08-10 13:28:31	arij	lmk if you need instructions
2017-08-10 13:29:06	arij	going home
2017-08-10 13:46:39	tr4656_	_rubik: Isn't layout enough reason
2017-08-10 14:22:08	zekkin	I mean, I don't have to explain why I want something if it doesn't affect anyone else
2017-08-10 14:22:22	zekkin	But hhkb is intriguing enough for me to want to give it a go
2017-08-10 14:23:26	_rubik	Fair. rf87u is relatively bland.
2017-08-10 14:26:53	Berzerker	hhkb layout will fuck with you when going to a non-topre
2017-08-10 14:26:59	Berzerker	control on the caps lock
2017-08-10 14:30:56	arij	i never use capslock
2017-08-10 14:31:05	arij	and i was going to get that other controller
2017-08-10 14:31:22	tr4656_	Berzerker: I solve that by switching every keyboard to that layout
2017-08-10 14:31:28	tr4656_	and same with backspace and \
2017-08-10 14:31:28	Berzerker	lol
2017-08-10 14:31:38	arij	Berzerker white or black hhkb
2017-08-10 14:31:41	Berzerker	split backspace is cancer
2017-08-10 14:31:43	Berzerker	arij: black
2017-08-10 14:31:43	tr4656_	i'm actually serious
2017-08-10 14:31:44	arij	i value your opinion
2017-08-10 14:31:46	arij	oh
2017-08-10 14:31:49	arij	i was hoping you would say white
2017-08-10 14:32:03	Berzerker	so regardless of what I said you were going to make the wrong decision anyway
2017-08-10 14:32:09	tr4656_	well i don't mind if its not split backspace
2017-08-10 14:32:13	arij	no that doesnt mean im going to buy a white one
2017-08-10 14:32:18	Berzerker	ok
2017-08-10 14:32:21	tr4656_	but i do want the backspae right above enter
2017-08-10 14:32:32	Berzerker	but I use \
2017-08-10 14:32:41	arij	where is \ on hhkb
2017-08-10 14:32:45	Berzerker	above \
2017-08-10 14:32:49	arij	oh
2017-08-10 14:32:52	arij	that works
2017-08-10 14:33:07	arij	seems like a more sensible layout tbh
2017-08-10 14:34:04	arij	tr4656_ is yours white or black? if you have one of each which do you like more
2017-08-10 14:34:16	tr4656_	i have both remember
2017-08-10 14:34:25	tr4656_	well, the problem here is that they have different layouts
2017-08-10 14:34:32	tr4656_	and also a different feature set
2017-08-10 14:34:37	tr4656_	black is JP with BT
2017-08-10 14:34:37	arij	which layout do you prefer
2017-08-10 14:34:44	tr4656_	white is standard with hasu
2017-08-10 14:34:49	arij	hasuuuuuuuuuuu
2017-08-10 14:34:52	zekkin	arij: how
2017-08-10 14:34:58	arij	zekkin amazon.jp
2017-08-10 14:35:01	zekkin	ah
2017-08-10 14:35:02	arij	i have a guide that walks you through it
2017-08-10 14:35:03	zekkin	i'll check it out
2017-08-10 14:35:06	arij	sure
2017-08-10 14:35:16	arij	can def sell on /r/mm for what you paid if not more
2017-08-10 14:35:18	arij	if you dont like it
2017-08-10 14:35:42	zekkin	oh yeah, i know
2017-08-10 14:35:46	zekkin	it'll be ezpz
2017-08-10 14:36:14	tr4656_	arij: I think that if you want JP layout, expect a learning curve
2017-08-10 14:36:21	tr4656_	and maybe messing you up if you use other keyboards
2017-08-10 14:37:04	arij	i dont want jp
2017-08-10 14:37:08	arij	i just want to decide which color to get
2017-08-10 14:37:20	arij	all i know is i also want some blank 1u mods
2017-08-10 14:37:28	arij	maybe with two colors like yours
2017-08-10 14:38:46	tr4656_	i actually have mostly a full set of fruit basket v2 in topres
2017-08-10 14:39:07	tr4656_	but uh idk, just pick what color you like
2017-08-10 14:39:18	tr4656_	i got white first and personally prefer it
2017-08-10 14:39:39	arij	:O
2017-08-10 14:39:44	arij	fruit basket
2017-08-10 14:39:44	tr4656_	but i also like beige and silver boards
2017-08-10 14:39:45	arij	can i haz
2017-08-10 14:39:49	tr4656_	yeah for money
2017-08-10 14:39:56	arij	how much is one

2017-08-10 14:40:19	arij	$10-$20?
2017-08-10 14:40:27	tr4656_	probably more like $45
2017-08-10 14:40:33	arij	alright cool

2017-08-14 10:34:33	keveloper	na_th_an: sameeeeee
2017-08-14 10:35:44	_rubik	oo na_th_an quick question. When you torrent, do you use anything more than a vpn?
2017-08-14 10:35:52	zekkin	vroom vroom
2017-08-14 10:36:06	na_th_an	no I use a vpn for downloading torrents and nzb but that's it
2017-08-14 10:36:19	_rubik	Have you heard of Tails?
2017-08-14 10:36:32	na_th_an	i use dockers for deluge and nzbget with vpn support
2017-08-14 10:36:34	na_th_an	yeah i have
2017-08-14 10:37:59	_rubik	Duh fuq is usenet. I have been out of the game for too long
2017-08-14 10:38:18	na_th_an	usenet has been around longer than torrents :p
2017-08-14 10:38:53	na_th_an	I don't fully understand it, but you download xml files that are like torrent files. They have metadata for the usenet files. You get those from a usenet indexer
2017-08-14 10:38:57	na_th_an	then you need a usenet provider
2017-08-14 10:39:01	na_th_an	that actually hosts the files
2017-08-14 10:39:30	na_th_an	when it works it works really well but files aren't retained forever so really old stuff won't always work
2017-08-14 10:39:35	_rubik	Sooooooooooo it replaces standard sites like pirate bay etc.
2017-08-14 10:39:46	keveloper	_rubik: like is this real https://www.goapr.com/products/ecu_upgrade_20tsi_gen3_b9.html

2017-08-14 10:40:13	keveloper	_rubik: $629.99
2017-08-14 10:40:30	_rubik	keveloper: Yes. Very real. I want one very very bad. But I need a project car. I dont want to mess with my daily.
2017-08-14 10:40:55	keveloper	_rubik: that tune is only $630?
2017-08-14 10:40:55	_rubik	keveloper: I have seen people get their A4s near 400whp and increase fuel effiency.... Dont ask how.
2017-08-14 10:41:13	_rubik	keveloper: Stage 2 needs a hfc and an intake is recommended.
2017-08-14 10:41:15	keveloper	I've looked at APR before but never noticed the prive lol
2017-08-14 10:41:26	keveloper	_rubik: that's stage I
2017-08-14 10:41:39	_rubik	keveloper: So Most people go with an 034 hfc and a magnaflow or awe cat back exhaust.
2017-08-14 10:42:08	_rubik	keveloper: Oh. You can find stage 1 for like 500 on sale, and then its only an extra 200 for stage 2.
2017-08-14 10:42:25	keveloper	except i need to better exhaust
2017-08-14 10:42:26	cdsboy	Stage 1 is the way to go~
2017-08-14 10:42:36	cdsboy	My STi has a stage 1 tune atm
2017-08-14 10:42:56	cdsboy	Although, I mostly have it for driveability reasons not power
2017-08-14 10:43:00	keveloper	_rubik: kinda wanna get an A5 sportback when I pay off my car and do this to it lol
2017-08-14 10:43:00	_rubik	Stage 1 will get you an extra 45whp. It's pretty tame, but very worth it if you still want to daily.
2017-08-14 10:43:09	keveloper	_rubik: yeah daily
2017-08-14 10:43:12	_rubik	keveloper: DO ITTTT.

2017-08-14 10:47:50	_rubik	keveloper: Yes. But a lot of these companies make parts for each model.

2017-08-14 11:46:32	abbyaha	i gotta say i would put money on it being no better than a cheap one
2017-08-14 11:47:12	arij	iduno about that. the polo i bought from sunspel is way nicer than some polo from target
2017-08-14 11:47:19	na_th_an	lololo "isn't $90 cheap [for a t-shirt]" you can't be serious
2017-08-14 11:47:34	arij	why is every one ganging up on me
2017-08-14 11:47:38	arij	thats not fair
2017-08-14 11:48:03	abbyaha	im finding it vvv hard to believe you think that that shirt is cheap
2017-08-14 11:48:12	arij	maybe its not cheap
2017-08-14 11:48:20	arij	but if you want to see an expensive one i can show you
2017-08-14 11:48:23	_rubik	arij: I _kinda_ have your back. I think they are undershooting, but you may be overshooting.
2017-08-14 11:48:23	arij	itll be a lot more than $90
2017-08-14 11:48:50	arij	ya, $10 shirt from target or walmart i dont think i would even want to step into those stores
2017-08-14 11:48:50	na_th_an	$5 is a cheap tshirt that probably won't last that long, $15 is probably a good tishirt
2017-08-14 11:49:55	arij	http://i.imgur.com/eFEUI9y.png <- thats an expensive t-shirt
2017-08-14 11:50:10	_rubik	Id say anything in the 25-55 range will be a good shirt. 60-75 is kinda understandable. 100+ is whacky for a white tee.
2017-08-14 11:50:17	arij	ya i agree

2017-08-14 11:52:42	arij	$315.00 for a blazer is reasonable amirite
2017-08-14 11:52:46	_rubik	Ye
2017-08-14 11:53:14	_rubik	Your cart looked fine.. but the white tee is a little much if you are planning to layer things over it.
2017-08-14 11:53:33	arij	ya i was just gonna wear it under the button up
2017-08-14 11:53:37	arij	i removed the white t
2017-08-14 11:53:52	_rubik	Yeah I would look at a jcrew white tee. Comfy and nice, but not too expensive.
2017-08-14 11:54:28	arij	btw a levis white tee is $100

2017-08-14 14:47:42	zekkin	i'm on the fence again about even getting a topre board
2017-08-14 14:47:47	zekkin	not sure i wanna buy another keyboard
2017-08-14 14:47:54	zekkin	even though topre is really resellable
2017-08-14 14:48:02	arij	my hhkb is going to be delivered today
2017-08-14 14:48:09	arij	but i already missed a package for something else :(
2017-08-14 14:48:21	arij	unless it was the hhkb that i missed
2017-08-14 14:48:49	arij	is it weird if i drive down the street and find the mail person

2017-08-14 14:49:12	arij	then brb :D
2017-08-14 14:49:14	tr4656_	I like HHKBs a lot
2017-08-14 14:50:23	zekkin	if i get topre i think i might have to get a fc660c
2017-08-14 14:51:07	tr4656_	Good plan
2017-08-14 14:51:19	tr4656_	Hasu has a FC660C controller now anyways
2017-08-14 14:51:26	zekkin	yeah
2017-08-14 14:51:40	tr4656_	I think it's pretty equal quality to the HHKB
2017-08-14 14:52:00	tr4656_	Although I think the best color scheme is the one I have
2017-08-14 14:52:10	tr4656_	aka the Hangul one
2017-08-14 14:52:32	tr4656_	which is still worse than hhkb blank imo

2017-08-14 15:03:28	arij	wasnt keyboard

2017-08-14 15:45:05	_rubik	Well I originall thought I wanted to rack mound my data server. But then I realized that was silly since I dont have a rack...
2017-08-14 15:45:20	_rubik	So yeah. An external drive enclosure.
2017-08-14 15:45:27	na_th_an	single drive?
2017-08-14 15:45:37	na_th_an	raid enclosure?
2017-08-14 15:45:41	na_th_an	JBOD enclosure?

2017-08-14 15:45:56	_rubik	Raid enclosure
2017-08-14 15:47:15	_rubik	In reality. I could just use an old tower of mine... But then I would need a new mobo and psu

2017-08-14 15:48:52	Slasher	^
2017-08-14 15:48:53	na_th_an	if your hardware RAID controller fails then you lose everything
2017-08-14 15:49:03	na_th_an	if you use software raid that's not a concern
2017-08-14 15:49:29	_rubik	Yeah.... but it also is more expensive..
2017-08-14 15:49:36	na_th_an	hell, look on craigslist and I bet you could get the hardware you need for like $50
2017-08-14 15:49:46	_rubik	na_th_an: That is true.
2017-08-14 15:50:50	_rubik	WAIIITT.... Can't I use a RasPI for this?
2017-08-14 15:51:20	na_th_an	if you want to interface with all your drives over USB and have really shitty speeds, yeah

2017-08-14 15:52:42	na_th_an	it's something I know *nothing* about rn
2017-08-14 15:52:54	na_th_an	I'm using all 6 of the SATA ports in my current NAS though :(
2017-08-14 15:53:04	zekkin	start simple
2017-08-14 15:53:11	_rubik	Yeah... I know enough to get bits and pieces up.
2017-08-14 15:53:18	_rubik	zekkin: and what is a "simple start"
2017-08-14 15:53:21	zekkin	i've had a dell poweredge t20 running in my apartment
2017-08-14 15:53:41	zekkin	for an esxi host
2017-08-14 15:54:21	zekkin	obviously you dont need to have rack servers and a rack to homelab
2017-08-14 15:54:38	na_th_an	i think I'm venturing into homelab territory
2017-08-14 15:54:45	na_th_an	I have a headless gaming VM now
2017-08-14 15:55:12	zekkin	i'd need to build my own server to do something like that
2017-08-14 15:55:19	zekkin	i manage just fine with steam link for now though
2017-08-14 15:55:27	na_th_an	steam link is how I connect to the vm
2017-08-14 15:55:36	_rubik	G5 tower 500gb for 150.. God I love craigslist
2017-08-14 15:55:47	na_th_an	my nas is an 8350 16gb ram
2017-08-14 15:55:56	na_th_an	the gpu is only an nvidia 645 though :(
2017-08-14 15:56:16	zekkin	i think amd cards work best w/ hardware passthrough
2017-08-14 15:56:30	na_th_an	the hardware passthrough has worked great for me with nvidia
2017-08-14 15:56:52	na_th_an	I have to have 2 GPUs though, one for the host
2017-08-14 15:56:58	na_th_an	i had an nvidia 210 sitting around
2017-08-14 15:57:00	Slasher	na_th_an: ah custom nas?

2017-08-14 15:57:11	na_th_an	it's mostly old parts I had sitting around

2017-08-14 16:06:47	_rubik	I gotchu.
2017-08-14 16:06:53	arij	i feel like i should get rid of one of my mx keyboards now
2017-08-14 16:07:09	arij	so how can i get some 55g domes
2017-08-14 16:07:17	arij	this feels good but its a little light
2017-08-14 16:07:28	_rubik	Well there is a gh thread on getting some rubber domes.
2017-08-14 16:07:44	_rubik	Like.. Instead of ripping them out of another board.
2017-08-14 16:07:47	arij	i saw this keyboard with 55g domes but it was more expensive than the hhkb
2017-08-14 16:08:05	_rubik	Most likely RF87u
2017-08-14 16:08:18	_rubik	or just a RF, they are all 55g IIRC
2017-08-14 16:08:19	arij	are these just usb passthough
2017-08-14 16:08:25	arij	through
2017-08-14 16:08:28	_rubik	Yes.
2017-08-14 16:08:35	arij	thats pretty cool
2017-08-14 16:08:42	arij	plug in my yubikey
2017-08-14 16:08:43	_rubik	That is the one feature I miss with the JIS versio
2017-08-14 16:08:51	_rubik	YO I LOVE YUBIKEYS
2017-08-14 16:09:08	arij	yubikey best key
2017-08-14 16:09:19	_rubik	Which did you get / what do you use them for?
2017-08-14 16:09:28	arij	i have the old white one
2017-08-14 16:09:35	_rubik	Yeah thats the same one I have
2017-08-14 16:09:36	arij	i use it forbitcoin stuff
2017-08-14 16:10:01	_rubik	Ahh gotcha.
2017-08-14 16:10:11	arij	i dont know if i really like this case tho
2017-08-14 16:10:18	arij	it feels flimsy
2017-08-14 16:10:29	_rubik	I've always wanted to weight mine.
2017-08-14 16:10:32	arij	are there any aluminum cases
2017-08-14 16:10:42	_rubik	Yes, but they are bulky and expensive
2017-08-14 16:11:01	arij	oh
2017-08-14 16:11:37	slaytaner	I might go for an fc660c instead
2017-08-14 16:11:51	_rubik	Yeah. I want to get some neo foam and some non-lead weights, and layer them on the bottom of the case. Reduces inside echo and gives it some more heft.
2017-08-14 16:12:08	_rubik	I also plan to use the hasu controller and jtk slider for gmk laser
2017-08-14 16:12:36	arij	i heard jtk sliders are wack
2017-08-14 16:12:42	arij	find some novatouch sliders
2017-08-14 16:12:44	_rubik	I heard they feel gritty..
2017-08-14 16:13:13	arij	what are they keys next to spacebar
2017-08-14 16:13:14	abbyaha	YOU feel gritty
2017-08-14 16:13:25	_rubik	I honestly feel like my hhkb sliders have smoothed out over time... most likely just wear
2017-08-14 16:13:29	_rubik	abbyaha: tybb

2017-08-14 16:15:01	_rubik	windows
2017-08-14 16:15:11	arij	i never use that key
2017-08-14 16:15:28	_rubik	You clearly don't use tiling window managers enough. i3 for life
2017-08-14 16:15:45	arij	i forget what all the good windows shortcuts are
2017-08-14 16:15:52	arij	also this keyboard is kind of loud
2017-08-14 16:16:14	_rubik	"This rubber dome keyboard is load"
2017-08-14 16:16:38	arij	should i wait until my silencing rings arrive to lube the sliders
2017-08-14 16:16:49	arij	or should i just lube now then take apart again for the rings
2017-08-14 16:17:06	arij	dunno how difficult it is to disassemble and reassemble
2017-08-14 16:17:17	_rubik	I haven't ever felt the need to lube topre..
2017-08-14 16:17:29	arij	oh? people told me to do it
2017-08-14 16:17:38	arij	that it would be quieter and feel better
2017-08-14 16:17:43	_rubik	Its interesting to dissasemble. I would watch some videos first because some of the domes come loose, and the springs fall out, and its just a pain.
2017-08-14 16:18:13	arij	oh
2017-08-14 16:18:17	arij	so i guess ill wait for the rings then
2017-08-14 16:18:22	_rubik	My topre experience is limited to stock rf87u and hhkb pro jp.
2017-08-14 16:18:26	arij	did you put rings or just change the domes
2017-08-14 16:18:36	_rubik	I just changed the domes
2017-08-14 16:18:40	_rubik	makes life much easier
2017-08-14 16:19:41	arij	this is prety nice to type on tho
2017-08-14 16:19:47	_rubik	That is true.
2017-08-14 16:19:51	arij	sounds kind of hollow tho
2017-08-14 16:20:02	_rubik	Ok perks of getting to work at 8, I get to head out early too. Time to commute
2017-08-14 16:20:05	_rubik	Talk to you later
2017-08-14 16:20:06	arij	yay
2017-08-14 16:51:26	tr4656_	arij: It's kind of loud?
2017-08-14 16:51:34	tr4656_	i never had that issue
2017-08-14 16:52:46	tr4656_	What do you use normally?
2017-08-14 16:53:05	tr4656_	Also yeah, main things to use windows key for i think on windows is just window management via arrows and using search
2017-08-14 16:53:56	arij	this doesnt have arrows tholol
2017-08-14 16:54:16	arij	also the media controls dont work
2017-08-14 16:54:24	arij	isnt it just fn+the button for that?
2017-08-14 16:54:32	arij	loud... kind of just sounds hollow
2017-08-14 16:54:43	arij	im sure itll sound better with the silentx rings and a little bit of lube
2017-08-14 16:55:27	arij	i do really like the layout tho
2017-08-14 16:55:33	arij	like control and backspace position
2017-08-14 16:55:42	tr4656_	I don't use rings on mine
2017-08-14 16:55:48	arij	i already ordered them

2017-08-15 10:25:41	keveloper	_rubik: high beams are the only things that don't work?
2017-08-15 10:25:45	_rubik	Yes.
2017-08-15 10:25:53	keveloper	weird
2017-08-15 10:26:09	_rubik	I think it's a software issue. But I cannot be sure. The dash light comes on, but the beams do not.
2017-08-15 10:26:22	keveloper	did you replace the switch module thing
2017-08-15 10:26:33	_rubik	Thats the next step.
2017-08-15 10:26:53	_rubik	If that does not work, it's software and needs to be reflashed. And Audi dealers charge through the nose...
2017-08-15 10:27:15	keveloper	boo
2017-08-15 10:27:19	keveloper	is there no DIY way
2017-08-15 10:27:28	_rubik	I dont do electrical
2017-08-15 10:27:36	keveloper	the software thing doesn't make sense it has to be the switch
2017-08-15 10:27:47	_rubik	So I have a guy I trust, who is a friend of a friend. One of the best in Boston.
2017-08-15 10:28:02	_rubik	keveloper: .... I uhhh... tweaked some software bits a few years back
2017-08-15 10:28:10	_rubik	for day time running lights.
2017-08-15 10:28:19	keveloper	...
2017-08-15 10:28:20	keveloper	oh
2017-08-15 10:28:21	keveloper	rip
2017-08-15 10:28:50	_rubik	Long story short....... its either the switch or software. Switch is a few hundred, software is near a grand.
2017-08-15 10:28:52	keveloper	if you did that yourself why can't you reflash yourself
2017-08-15 10:29:16	_rubik	I dont have the OEM software.
2017-08-15 10:29:33	_rubik	They don't sell that. So I'd have to go to the dealer.
2017-08-15 10:29:55	keveloper	find someone else with an 09 a4 and get it off their car lol
2017-08-15 10:29:58	keveloper	:P
2017-08-15 10:30:07	_rubik	Yeah Ill just steal their ecu
2017-08-15 10:30:23	keveloper	there's no way to download it?
2017-08-15 10:30:32	_rubik	Sadly no.
2017-08-15 10:30:38	keveloper	buy an apr ecu
2017-08-15 10:30:47	_rubik	And honestly Id rather have someone who actually knows what they are doing do it...
2017-08-15 10:30:48	keveloper	don't they make them
2017-08-15 10:31:08	_rubik	They make the software to flash. I don't think it touches accessory controllers though\.
2017-08-15 10:31:20	keveloper	Aw
2017-08-15 10:31:39	keveloper	does ECU not control headlights
2017-08-15 10:31:50	_rubik	Yeah. I think I'll live, but it's stressful because I need to get it inspected...
2017-08-15 10:33:05	keveloper	which a4 do you have
2017-08-15 10:33:28	keveloper	3.0L?
2017-08-15 10:33:42	_rubik	its either 3.2 or 2.0t
2017-08-15 10:33:44	_rubik	I have 2.0t
2017-08-15 10:34:15	keveloper	there was a 3.0L
2017-08-15 10:34:26	_rubik	for b8?

2017-08-15 14:03:12	keveloper	I don't think you can get an S5 with 34k miles and one owner for $34k
2017-08-15 14:03:23	_rubik	No you cannot hahah
2017-08-15 14:03:53	keveloper	tbf the a5 with the stage 1 upgrade is pretty close to the s5 performance right?
2017-08-15 14:04:13	tr4656_	arij: I mean it all comes down to the cost

2017-08-15 15:21:37	_rubik	How do you plan to blow it up? Spin it so fast the centrifugal force tears it apart?

2017-08-15 17:05:38	tr4656_	acrylic though?
2017-08-15 17:05:39	arij	is a rotoring pencil worth anything
2017-08-15 17:05:41	arij	yea acrylic
2017-08-15 17:05:43	tr4656_	yes
2017-08-15 17:05:49	arij	i found one at work
2017-08-15 17:05:50	tr4656_	Well, do you write with mechanical pencils?
2017-08-15 17:05:54	arij	no

2017-08-15 17:06:07	tr4656_	(i might used to collect them)
2017-08-15 17:06:18	arij	the pacific arch feels more solid than the rotoring

2017-08-15 17:07:02	arij	300
2017-08-15 17:07:12	tr4656_	ah the plastic one
2017-08-15 17:07:15	arij	yea
2017-08-15 17:07:18	arij	the other one is metal tho
2017-08-15 17:07:20	tr4656_	yes i think the 600
2017-08-15 17:07:22	tr4656_	is better
2017-08-15 17:07:32	tr4656_	That's what I have

2017-08-15 17:08:50	arij	where is it

2017-08-15 17:09:11	arij	just a spot to put more lead

2017-08-15 17:09:46	arij	oh
2017-08-15 17:09:55	arij	i also found a pilot varsity but it has no ink in it
2017-08-15 17:10:18	tr4656_	pretty sure those 1309 are either rebranded rotring 600s
2017-08-15 17:10:20	tr4656_	or copies
2017-08-15 17:10:54	tr4656_	considering that sanford owns rotring for years now, not surprised if they do grey market
2017-08-15 17:11:11	arij	oh
2017-08-15 17:12:04	tr4656_	but could be a clone not sure

2017-08-16 12:37:06	_rubik	So I had this stroke of ... brilliance(?) at lunch
2017-08-16 12:38:14	_rubik	In CPP, maintain a dictionary of mirrors per timezone per distro. Use libtorrent to download the torrent, automate the disk wipe/format/dd and done.
2017-08-16 12:38:37	na_th_an	what are you trying to accomplish
2017-08-16 12:38:46	na_th_an	i don't understand what problem you are trying to solve
2017-08-16 12:39:23	na_th_an	also, if you're using dd to write isos to a block device, you don't need to clear the device first
2017-08-16 12:39:37	na_th_an	you can just dd straight onto whatever is there and the partition table will be overwritten
2017-08-16 12:39:43	_rubik	Automate the "create a live boot usb" problem. Centralize iso downloading. Formatting etc.
2017-08-16 12:40:07	_rubik	na_th_an: I generally like to delete partitios and format to a Fat32 before dd. For good measure.
2017-08-16 12:40:21	na_th_an	I've literally never done that and never had any issue at all
2017-08-16 12:40:28	na_th_an	you're overwriting the partition table either way so it doesn't matter
2017-08-16 12:40:49	na_th_an	also if you're downloading from torrents then you don't really need to worry about mirrors
2017-08-16 12:40:58	na_th_an	I guess I'm just confused on what you're trying to do

2017-08-16 12:41:40	_rubik	I don't want to be bother to hunt down an iso, and do all the disk formatting. I want to make it one command.
2017-08-16 12:42:12	_rubik	ie. ./live iso ubuntu 16.04 /dev/sdb

2017-08-16 12:44:43	_rubik	maybe... I'm just being lazy..
2017-08-16 12:49:40	na_th_an	being lazy is what programming is all about
2017-08-16 12:50:12	na_th_an	if you want to do something like this
2017-08-16 12:50:23	na_th_an	I'd write it in bash or python tbh
2017-08-16 12:50:26	na_th_an	cpp is overkill
2017-08-16 12:50:45	_rubik	I wrote it originall in bash, but now I want to add the torrent bit.
2017-08-16 12:50:47	na_th_an	I'd start by finding something to download torrents like wget downloads http
2017-08-16 12:50:53	na_th_an	tget looks like it'll do that
2017-08-16 12:50:56	na_th_an	I'm sure there are others
2017-08-16 12:51:12	na_th_an	then pass the magnet link to the script with the device
2017-08-16 12:51:15	_rubik	I was thinking of using libtorrent.
2017-08-16 12:51:16	na_th_an	the scripting would bepretty simple
2017-08-16 12:51:23	na_th_an	why reinvent what other people have already done?
2017-08-16 12:51:43	na_th_an	seems like transmission also has a cli client
2017-08-16 12:51:46	_rubik	Because I can.... and because it would give me more control... and because I hate myself a little.
2017-08-16 12:52:00	na_th_an	is the primary goal to hate yourself or be lazy? :p
2017-08-16 12:52:16	_rubik	Thats true. Good point sir.
2017-08-16 12:52:25	_rubik	But you also cant do anything in parallel in bash
2017-08-16 12:52:40	_rubik	I could, in cpp, run two threads. One for the torrent, and one for disk prep
2017-08-16 12:53:52	na_th_an	true. if bash isn't good enough for what you need I'd use python
2017-08-16 12:54:03	keveloper	yeah fuck cpp
2017-08-16 12:54:11	na_th_an	(or groovy... but I'm an outliar in that I really love groovy)
2017-08-16 12:54:21	keveloper	groovy is awesome
2017-08-16 12:54:33	na_th_an	also you CAN run things in parallel in bash
2017-08-16 12:54:41	na_th_an	diskprep /dev/sda &
2017-08-16 12:54:44	keveloper	yeah can't you fork processes
2017-08-16 12:54:44	na_th_an	:)
2017-08-16 12:54:45	keveloper	yeah
2017-08-16 12:54:53	_rubik	gtfo
2017-08-16 12:54:55	na_th_an	it's a little fucky tho
2017-08-16 12:55:01	na_th_an	which is why i'd reach for python at that point
2017-08-16 12:55:01	_rubik	But you are also correct
2017-08-16 12:55:12	_rubik	I am avoiding python because I want a binary
2017-08-16 12:55:18	na_th_an	if I were you I'd just skip the disk prep because it's pointless though :p
2017-08-16 12:56:53	na_th_an	why?

2017-08-16 12:58:37	keveloper	is there a problem
2017-08-16 13:00:40	_rubik	Maybe I like giving myself a challenge...
2017-08-16 13:00:56	_rubik	Also I have been doing everything in python and want something harder.
2017-08-16 13:01:11	_rubik	But yes, you two are right. Everything is easier in python

2017-08-16 13:30:35	_rubik	na_th_an: Also... for some reason the transmission cli isnt on osx. Only linux distros
2017-08-16 13:31:40	na_th_an	that's because osx sucks
2017-08-16 13:32:06	_rubik	well yea no duh. But I can't implement somethign that doesn't work across distros. Thus back to the idea of a compiled binary.

2017-08-16 13:38:54	_rubik	tr4656_: It's just as of late. I usually keep a boot of tails with me, and am upgrading all my older machines.
2017-08-16 13:39:18	tr4656_	Why don't you just download all of th em
2017-08-16 13:39:28	tr4656_	and then flash that when needed
2017-08-16 13:39:53	tr4656_	it would be easier if you didn't need to use bittorrent every time
2017-08-16 13:40:28	_rubik	Well my solution would downlaod them, and store them for later use (unless otherwise specified)
2017-08-16 13:40:50	tr4656_	right
2017-08-16 13:41:07	tr4656_	i think at this point maybe its just easier to download them initially
2017-08-16 13:41:26	_rubik	I used to keep maintain a directory of just isos, but that puts a strain on storage space.
2017-08-16 13:42:23	tr4656_	turns out you need to be a datahoarder to keep actual linux isos :P
2017-08-16 13:42:31	_rubik	SEE
2017-08-16 13:42:34	_rubik	another reason
2017-08-16 13:43:21	_rubik	I think that is the solution here. Just buy 4x10tb
2017-08-16 13:44:40	na_th_an	I mean, best buy has 8TB WDD Reds for $180 rn
2017-08-16 13:44:44	na_th_an	I got one yesterday :)
2017-08-16 13:44:52	na_th_an	my NAS is finally backed up for the first time ever
2017-08-16 13:45:35	_rubik	Yeah see... money is tight right now, so building NAS or even just a raid array would REALLY stretch the bank

2017-08-16 13:49:01	tr4656_	Well they were always expensive
2017-08-16 13:49:19	tr4656_	It's just Best Buy puts them in a best buy exclusive model and in a usb hub shell
2017-08-16 13:49:21	na_th_an	$180 for 8TB NAS HDD is not expensive :)
2017-08-16 13:49:23	tr4656_	they're fairly easy to shuck
2017-08-16 13:49:32	tr4656_	 I mean stock wd reds
2017-08-16 13:49:33	na_th_an	yeah I broke the case shucking it but it was pretty easy
2017-08-16 13:49:37	na_th_an	i know i know
2017-08-16 13:49:47	tr4656_	and you're paying more for warranty
2017-08-16 13:49:55	tr4656_	if you shuck them you have basically  no warranty
2017-08-16 13:49:56	na_th_an	yeah pretty much
2017-08-16 13:50:09	_rubik	I might go 4x 1TB in Raid 10 to start...
2017-08-16 13:50:16	tr4656_	WD  knows which serial numbers are used in those easystores anyways
2017-08-16 13:50:28	tr4656_	RAID 10?
2017-08-16 13:50:46	_rubik	not this argument again...
2017-08-16 13:50:57	tr4656_	lol
2017-08-16 13:51:04	na_th_an	raid 10 seems so risky to me
2017-08-16 13:51:10	na_th_an	but I'm on unraid now so what do i know
2017-08-16 13:51:12	_rubik	What would make you happy? 5EE
2017-08-16 13:51:36	tr4656_	it's not like i optimize for parity either
2017-08-16 13:51:40	tr4656_	i'm still on raid 5
2017-08-16 13:51:56	na_th_an	I was on raid 5 with 3x2TB until I moved to unraid
2017-08-16 13:52:10	_rubik	na_th_an: Why does 10 scare you. It can handle up to 1 drive failure on a 4 drive system
2017-08-16 13:52:36	na_th_an	because then you have to pray that the mirror drive from the failed half restores correctly
2017-08-16 13:52:45	na_th_an	if that drive fails during restoration you lose everything
2017-08-16 13:52:48	tr4656_	na_th_an: I have a question, why unraid over freenas for example
2017-08-16 13:53:06	na_th_an	from everything I read it seemed like unraid would be much easier to use
2017-08-16 13:53:15	na_th_an	it has great docker support that's easier to use than freenas's jails
2017-08-16 13:53:15	tr4656_	oh
2017-08-16 13:53:16	tr4656_	that's true
2017-08-16 13:53:28	na_th_an	the ability to add single drives is verynice
2017-08-16 13:53:28	_rubik	na_th_an: So what makes you feel the most safe? Raid1?
2017-08-16 13:53:37	tr4656_	So does everything run fine?
2017-08-16 13:53:45	na_th_an	_rubik: idk honestly
2017-08-16 13:53:46	tr4656_	aka sonarr/radarr/plex that type of stuff
2017-08-16 13:53:48	na_th_an	yeah unraid has been awesome
2017-08-16 13:54:19	na_th_an	I run nzbget-vpn, sonarr, radarr, deluge-vpn, openvpn-as, duckdns, apache guacamole in dockers
2017-08-16 13:54:27	na_th_an	probably 1 or 2 others I'm forgetting
2017-08-16 13:54:35	tr4656_	ah
2017-08-16 13:54:37	_rubik	I mean if you are afraid of parity failing go with double parity RAID 6
2017-08-16 13:54:37	na_th_an	and a headless windows 10 VM with GPU passthrough
2017-08-16 13:55:13	na_th_an	one thing I didn't like about zfs/freenas is that if one of your vdevs fail then you lose the whole pool
2017-08-16 13:55:19	na_th_an	also you can't ever remove a vdev once you add it
2017-08-16 13:55:39	na_th_an	with unraid, even if you lose more drives than your parity can handle, you still retain the data on the working drives
2017-08-16 13:55:45	tr4656_	i basically need nzbget, sonarr, radarr, plex, organizr, openvpn
2017-08-16 13:55:51	tr4656_	so i guess unraid should work here
2017-08-16 13:55:54	na_th_an	it also has nice features with caching on SSDs
2017-08-16 13:55:56	na_th_an	yeah it would
2017-08-16 13:55:59	na_th_an	I use emby instead of plex
2017-08-16 13:56:04	na_th_an	forgot to mention emby
2017-08-16 13:56:08	tr4656_	oh and headphones
2017-08-16 13:56:30	na_th_an	yeah there's a "community applications" plugin
2017-08-16 13:56:36	na_th_an	and you search it for dockers and hit install
2017-08-16 13:56:42	na_th_an	it's very simple
2017-08-16 13:56:44	tr4656_	why do you like empy over plex?
2017-08-16 13:56:47	tr4656_	*emby
2017-08-16 13:57:32	na_th_an	I don't have a ton of experience with either, but I don't like how plex is always trying to get me to buy a plex pass
2017-08-16 13:57:34	na_th_an	and emby is more open source
2017-08-16 13:57:35	tr4656_	Cause I'm open to switching, just need a reason why
2017-08-16 13:57:45	na_th_an	emby has its own thing like plex pass but it's a little less in your face about it
2017-08-16 13:57:51	na_th_an	idk there's no real big difference
2017-08-16 13:58:01	na_th_an	at least not that I'm aware of
2017-08-16 13:58:04	na_th_an	they both seem to work fine

2017-08-16 14:00:24	_rubik	Ok I wwas wondering this yesterday. I'm new to data hoarding. a) do you pirate all this media b) do you manually add artwork and metadata so these media servers look ligit
2017-08-16 14:00:47	cdsboy	for plex, Berzerker and I pirate it all
2017-08-16 14:00:58	cdsboy	I believe he manually adds some artwork and metadata but Berzerker would have to confirm that
2017-08-16 14:01:11	tr4656_	_rubik: I don't pirate everything. Sonarr and Radarr will name things accordingly, otherwise I do it semi-manually via Filebot
2017-08-16 14:01:26	cdsboy	I usually let it stay as is unless it's actively breaking the server I'm using
2017-08-16 14:01:26	tr4656_	Plex can match your file/folder names to tvdb or moviedb
2017-08-16 14:01:33	tr4656_	and then grab metadata
2017-08-16 14:01:38	na_th_an	I pirate everything. Sonarr and Radarr automatically import everything and grab metadata for me.
2017-08-16 14:01:44	cdsboy	(for example, plex will break on seasons if they're named too closely)
2017-08-16 14:01:56	tr4656_	why don't you just name things properly...

2017-08-16 14:08:48	_rubik	Waittt..... tr4656_, the rip repo you sent says he uses itunes store videos as his template. Can you rip RENTED itunes videos?
2017-08-16 14:12:49	tr4656_	I'm not sure
2017-08-16 14:12:50	_rubik	Wait that was a dumb question... disregard.
2017-08-16 14:13:08	tr4656_	they all have drm
2017-08-16 14:13:34	tr4656_	well technically that repo doesn't do ripping but just transcoding to a more reasonable format
2017-08-16 14:13:45	_rubik	Yeah thats what I figured.
2017-08-16 14:23:13	Berzerker	cdsboy: confirmed
2017-08-16 14:23:25	Berzerker	I did manually add artwork if there weren't any with japanese titles
2017-08-16 14:24:15	Berzerker	_rubik: plex has built-in scanners for adding metadata, but there are third-party ones like hama (anidb) and one that does MAL (better imo) for anime
2017-08-16 14:24:28	Berzerker	for mainstream hollywood movies and stuff, the built in movie scanners are perfectly fine
2017-08-16 14:24:54	na_th_an	yeah I don't really have any anime. sonarr/radarr have worked great for me
2017-08-16 14:28:18	tr4656_	Which one is the one that does MAL?
2017-08-16 14:28:22	tr4656_	I'm using hama
2017-08-16 14:29:55	Berzerker	https://github.com/Fribb/MyAnimeList.bundle

2017-08-16 14:30:16	Berzerker	need BABS also
2017-08-16 14:30:39	Berzerker	anidb tends to have a lot of blank posters, so I like using MAL since they have titles on them
2017-08-16 14:35:47	cdsboy	Berzerker also enjoys making it fucking impossible for intoxicated me to find any shows on our server by having them all have the romanji version of the title
2017-08-16 14:36:37	cdsboy	(I actually really appreciate the consistency the server has due to his efforts, just for the record)
2017-08-16 14:36:47	Berzerker	I only have the romaji version if that's the official title in japanese
2017-08-16 14:36:51	Berzerker	some shows legit have english titles
2017-08-16 14:36:55	tr4656_	isn't that a toggle anyways?
2017-08-16 14:36:59	Berzerker	like princess principal
2017-08-16 14:37:02	cdsboy	Yeah, like little witch academia
2017-08-16 14:37:11	cdsboy	which confused alex and I for like 15 minutes a few nights ago
2017-08-16 14:37:12	Berzerker	but like
2017-08-16 14:37:18	Berzerker	people call it "unbreakable machine dol"
2017-08-16 14:37:20	Berzerker	doll
2017-08-16 14:37:31	Berzerker	but the actual title is "machine doll wa kizutsukanai"
2017-08-16 14:37:50	Berzerker	or, busou shojou machiavellianism

2017-08-16 14:46:03	tr4656_	Problem is just having too much music
2017-08-16 14:46:11	arij	i just use google music
2017-08-16 14:46:15	arij	or spotify
2017-08-16 14:46:31	tr4656_	I also use GPM or Apple Music
2017-08-16 14:46:39	tr4656_	But on my computer I only use local music
2017-08-16 14:46:51	tr4656_	Or when I bother to carry iPod
2017-08-16 14:46:58	arij	does it sound better or something?
2017-08-16 14:47:00	arij	whats the benefit
2017-08-16 14:47:18	tr4656_	90% of my music is in FLAC or ALAC
2017-08-16 14:47:23	arij	oh
2017-08-16 14:47:33	tr4656_	Not everything is even on GPM or Apple Music anyways
2017-08-16 14:47:44	na_th_an	it's about hoarding arij
2017-08-16 14:47:48	tr4656_	(Mostly classical or Asian music)
2017-08-16 14:47:49	arij	oh
2017-08-16 14:47:50	na_th_an	what if gpm shuts down

2017-08-16 14:47:57	arij	which it wont
2017-08-16 14:47:59	arij	but true
2017-08-16 14:48:00	na_th_an	i need to be prepared
2017-08-16 14:48:05	tr4656_	It should though
2017-08-16 14:48:05	na_th_an	they could have licensing issues
2017-08-16 14:48:07	tr4656_	It's so bad
2017-08-16 14:48:12	arij	what
2017-08-16 14:48:13	arij	its not that bad
2017-08-16 14:48:15	na_th_an	a label could pull all thoir music
2017-08-16 14:48:19	na_th_an	my internet could go out
2017-08-16 14:48:24	tr4656_	I hate GPM

2017-08-16 14:48:57	na_th_an	why?
2017-08-16 14:48:59	arij	spotify is superior
2017-08-16 14:49:24	tr4656_	Discovery and suggestions on GPM is really bad
2017-08-16 14:49:50	tr4656_	Web Player might still need flash, can't remember because I stopped using it on the web
2017-08-16 14:50:12	arij	i have the windows app
2017-08-16 14:50:14	arij	its pretty good
2017-08-16 14:50:23	arij	spotify suggestions for new music are way better than google
2017-08-16 14:50:32	tr4656_	The interface on mobile is still pretty terrible to navigate relative to other services

2017-08-16 15:24:04	cdsboy	That seems pretty straight forward TBH
2017-08-16 15:24:31	cdsboy	it's just telling you that you're either missing or misconfigured the field "labels" no?
2017-08-16 15:24:48	cdsboy	unless you aren't being sarcastic there
2017-08-16 15:24:49	cdsboy	lol

2017-08-16 15:32:47	cdsboy	oh
2017-08-16 15:32:53	_rubik	That is the way I interpreted it also, but the labels field is proper. I'm assuming its something around it.
2017-08-16 15:33:00	cdsboy	probably
2017-08-16 15:35:57	_rubik	Lol. The indentation for the block that "label" was in was out of whack. I love whitespace dependant yaml

2017-08-16 15:45:57	_rubik	my master node has been broken down into a cluster for replication controllers, one for etcd, one for utilities and finally the worker cluster
2017-08-16 15:46:24	_rubik	I FINALLY got my nginx ingress controller+ k8 ingress service to expose a cluster of tomcat pods

2017-08-16 23:46:45	slaytaner	no
2017-08-16 23:47:08	slaytaner	my media is unorganized
2017-08-16 23:48:22	tr4656_	well its also an iTunes replacement
2017-08-16 23:48:24	tr4656_	for playing music
2017-08-16 23:48:32	tr4656_	Probably more that than anything else tbh
2017-08-16 23:48:40	switchy	tr4656_, that looks like itunes
2017-08-16 23:48:48	tr4656_	but less shitty iTunes
2017-08-16 23:48:52	tr4656_	In speed/performance
2017-08-16 23:59:24	_rubik	Anyone here?
2017-08-16 23:59:37	slaytaner	hi
2017-08-16 23:59:54	switchy	hi
2017-08-16 23:59:57	_rubik	I just got about 4 pm from bots (im assuming) to a paste link that looks like some good ole cp
2017-08-17 00:00:36	_rubik	Do I just ignore it?
2017-08-17 00:00:42	_rubik	report it idk?
2017-08-17 00:01:37	_rubik	Wulp 2 more. I guess they have some bots just spamming. Is anyone else getting this?
2017-08-17 00:01:47	tr4656_	lol
2017-08-17 00:01:51	tr4656_	why are they targeting you
2017-08-17 00:01:55	switchy	_rubik, on freenode?
2017-08-17 00:02:04	switchy	report on #freenode
2017-08-17 00:02:10	tr4656_	^
2017-08-17 00:02:15	tr4656_	Can't have CP bots going around
2017-08-17 00:02:26	slaytaner	you're unlucky
2017-08-17 00:02:32	_rubik	How so?
2017-08-17 00:02:41	_rubik	Am I going to be investigated?
2017-08-17 00:02:54	slaytaner	no just getting it in the first place
2017-08-17 00:02:59	tr4656_	He means that they spammed you but i don't think anyone of us got it
2017-08-17 00:03:01	_rubik	Yeah thats what i though
2017-08-17 00:03:12	_rubik	Its a pasted jpg
2017-08-17 00:04:08	_rubik	Sigh. I hate some parts of the internet
2017-08-17 00:06:31	_rubik	Lol no one in freenode has actually reacted to what I said... wulp
2017-08-17 00:06:33	switchy	the internet is dumb
2017-08-17 00:08:09	_rubik	I just want to be left alone. I dont need this spam in my life.
2017-08-17 00:11:40	_rubik	Also I think I wasn't the first to report it. Freenodes topic is a warning about pm spam.
2017-08-17 00:12:01	switchy	ah, well there you go
2017-08-17 00:12:07	switchy	just ignore it anyway
2017-08-17 00:12:10	switchy	people are dumb
2017-08-17 00:12:26	_rubik	I hate that I even opened that :/
2017-08-17 00:13:11	_rubik	I know nothing will come of it, but it makes me cringe and get anxious.
2017-08-17 00:15:51	_rubik	Whats even worse is that my znc logs scooped the links up. Had to go wipe those too.
2017-08-17 00:15:51	switchy	yeah, it's messed up
2017-08-17 00:16:25	_rubik	And better yet. I love feeling like I may be getting monitored now
2017-08-17 00:16:31	_rubik	anyway. How's everyones night?

2017-08-17 00:20:53	_rubik	Lol. "An overview of lisp". Pass thanks. Vintage or modern.
2017-08-17 00:21:07	switchy	how is that not vintage?
2017-08-17 00:21:09	switchy	it's from '79!
2017-08-17 00:21:22	switchy	is "vintage" only 60s?
2017-08-17 00:21:40	_rubik	Im saying. Even if it is vintage, I'll pass on reading "an overview of lisp"
2017-08-17 00:21:48	_rubik	That is 100% vintage
2017-08-17 00:22:31	switchy	fair
2017-08-17 00:22:42	switchy	there's one about smalltalk too ;)
2017-08-17 00:22:44	switchy	or pascal
2017-08-17 00:23:20	switchy	or apl!
2017-08-17 00:24:56	_rubik	APL YIKES. A friend of mine cut out name tags and put a small peice over every key so he could label it
2017-08-17 00:25:03	_rubik	OOOO That could be a fun keyset
2017-08-17 00:25:14	switchy	just get a space cadet
2017-08-17 00:25:26	_rubik	Oh is it apl legens?

2017-08-17 00:25:51	switchy	I believe so
2017-08-17 00:26:15	switchy	hmm, well it was for MIT lisp machines
2017-08-17 00:26:32	_rubik	Yeah that isn't apl. I dont see Delta for example
2017-08-17 00:26:42	switchy	there are greek letters on the front of the keys
2017-08-17 00:26:52	switchy	I think apl was on the ibm selectric though
2017-08-17 00:26:58	switchy	there are some characters which you had to overtype
2017-08-17 00:27:33	_rubik	What am I saying.. Ill never use apl legends in my life, I dont care if they are correct or not

2017-08-22 09:07:21	na_th_an	super duper happy to be working
2017-08-22 09:08:24	_rubik	Also kindly fuck all you who are talking about data hoarding.
2017-08-22 09:08:34	na_th_an	:o
2017-08-22 09:08:39	na_th_an	excuse me
2017-08-22 09:08:39	_rubik	Now Im diving into /r/homelabs and plex
2017-08-22 09:08:42	_rubik	and I want
2017-08-22 09:08:49	na_th_an	/r/homelabs is like porn
2017-08-22 09:08:53	_rubik	all the r710s
2017-08-22 09:08:55	na_th_an	I'm never going to get that, but it's fun to look at
2017-08-22 09:09:28	na_th_an	I think consumer grade hardware is going to last me awhile
2017-08-22 09:09:29	_rubik	I just want ~4 r710s and a decent ubi router/switch stack and some pfsense hardware.
2017-08-22 09:10:04	_rubik	Thatll service my entire home network + plex + kubernetes
2017-08-22 09:10:09	na_th_an	I need storage more than I need computing power
2017-08-22 09:10:36	_rubik	The scary part is, you can get a LARGE cluster of r710s for the price of a new mbp
2017-08-22 09:10:50	na_th_an	only 12TB per server tho right?
2017-08-22 09:11:14	_rubik	at like retail new 350 a pop.... you can get 5 for the price of a new mac.
2017-08-22 09:11:32	_rubik	Yeah they are not meant for large storage. Only 4-6 drive raid arrays.
2017-08-22 09:11:41	na_th_an	lame
2017-08-22 09:11:46	na_th_an	i need all of the bits
2017-08-22 09:11:57	_rubik	..... right now.... 12tb > my 0
2017-08-22 09:12:20	na_th_an	you could go get 2 8TB easystores at $160 each rn
2017-08-22 09:12:21	_rubik	I went looking for the 8tb wd red deal. Its back to 200 :/
2017-08-22 09:13:37	na_th_an	aww :( they were at $160 like 3 days ago
2017-08-22 09:13:44	na_th_an	I got mine for $180 last week
2017-08-22 09:13:48	na_th_an	they go on sale frequently
2017-08-22 09:15:18	_rubik	Ill be on the hunt.
2017-08-22 09:15:43	_rubik	Im assuming you advice against used drives
2017-08-22 09:16:15	na_th_an	depends on how much you need your data, whether or not you have good backups, what kind of budget you have...
2017-08-22 09:16:34	na_th_an	if you can view the SMART data before buying that'd give you a good idea of how heavily used they are
2017-08-22 09:16:49	na_th_an	it could be a good thing because it'd get you into the bason of the bathtub curve
2017-08-22 09:18:20	_rubik	Well to answer your question. NEED my data. Its mostly movies and my personal backups. Currently I backup on an external drive via usb.. so not good. And budget as tight as possible.
2017-08-22 09:19:15	na_th_an	well if you have onsite backups for all your important data then you can restore pretty easily
2017-08-22 09:21:36	_rubik	Yeah I think I need to find 4-8x4-8tb drives on ebay or craiglist for cheap. Get storage space first, then upgrade.
2017-08-22 09:23:27	na_th_an	2TB drives are probably dirt cheap in the right places
2017-08-22 09:23:41	_rubik	Good point.
2017-08-22 09:24:10	keveloper	na_th_an: like ur butthole
2017-08-22 09:24:23	na_th_an	:o
2017-08-22 09:25:31	Slasher	whats yer budget
2017-08-22 09:39:07	_rubik	God dammit. Now I'm watching pfsense videos... What have you all done. I was happy with my layer 7 ignorance.
2017-08-22 09:42:49	cdsboy	4.4T    /mnt/media
2017-08-22 09:42:54	cdsboy	berzy and I need more data
2017-08-22 09:44:20	_rubik	just saw this in #datahoarder... "Why is RAID not backup??" zzzzzzz

2017-08-22 09:57:09	arij	I can sell you

2017-08-22 09:59:11	arij	Literally advises ear protection
2017-08-22 10:00:21	_rubik	also 3.5" bays are better imho. But its a toss between storage and heat.
2017-08-22 10:00:30	_rubik	How much were you thinking.
2017-08-22 10:03:21	arij	just a few hundered plus shipping
2017-08-22 10:03:27	arij	theyre pretty cheap
2017-08-22 10:03:47	arij	i guess if you want to search ebay and make me an offer

2017-08-22 10:08:17	arij	the ones with 75 probably barebones

2017-08-22 10:23:08	arij	have two gigabit drops into the cabinet, a+b power
2017-08-22 10:23:11	arij	so many things
2017-08-22 10:23:13	_rubik	ok after the tshirt conversation I'm convinced you're either loaded or REALLY bad with saving money. Or both
2017-08-22 10:23:20	arij	another 100mbit port for management
2017-08-22 10:23:28	arij	oh
2017-08-22 10:23:33	arij	probably both

2017-08-22 10:24:28	arij	Stuff and things
2017-08-22 10:25:11	arij	Vps hosting company/IT at Yale/Bitcoin investor
2017-08-22 10:26:09	_rubik	Ah gothca. That explains stuff.
2017-08-22 10:26:11	_rubik	and things
2017-08-22 10:31:12	_rubik	Honestly, my biggest issue with homelabs is not price, but noise
2017-08-22 10:31:28	arij	noise and heat
2017-08-22 10:31:31	arij	for sure
2017-08-22 10:31:34	_rubik	And simple utilities like power and heat
2017-08-22 10:31:38	_rubik	Yeah...
2017-08-22 10:31:57	arij	r610 probably cost around 30 to 40$ to run per month
2017-08-22 10:32:00	arij	in electricity
2017-08-22 10:33:09	_rubik	And then theres the AC bill
2017-08-22 10:33:44	arij	at least in the winter you wont have as much of an oil bill
2017-08-22 10:33:50	arij	if you use oil to heat your house
2017-08-22 10:34:21	_rubik	Im less concered about the power bill, but more about the power connection. This is not something you can run on with a simple wall outlet
2017-08-22 10:34:48	arij	r610? yea sure you can
2017-08-22 10:34:52	arij	m1000e, probably not
2017-08-22 10:35:28	_rubik	but 3 r710, router/switch, UPS etc..
2017-08-22 10:35:33	_rubik	Thats REALLY pushing it
2017-08-22 10:36:41	arij	Oh 3 though? At home? Lol why
2017-08-22 10:36:56	arij	You could go for one of those Dell cloud servers
2017-08-22 10:37:02	arij	Has four nodes in it
2017-08-22 10:38:31	_rubik	I like the idea of maintaining the cluster myself. Which is like saying, I like to own and service a gtr instead of leasing one for a year.
2017-08-22 10:55:00	slaytaner	fucking servers and switches are loud as shit
2017-08-22 10:55:10	abbyaha	smash 'em
2017-08-22 10:55:39	slaytaner	also my alarm went off and I immediately got a cramp
2017-08-22 10:56:23	_rubik	Ill most likely go the tower route.
2017-08-22 10:57:21	arij	same here i need to get this r610 out of my living room
2017-08-22 10:57:56	slaytaner	colo that shit

2017-08-22 10:59:14	slaytaner	ur a shared rack
2017-08-22 10:59:24	slaytaner	we don't do that anyway
2017-08-22 10:59:31	slaytaner	you'll have to talk to the dc
2017-08-22 10:59:42	slaytaner	and I don't reccomend the one we're in

2017-08-22 11:22:49	arij	i just dont feel motivated at all
2017-08-22 11:31:22	zekkin	slaytaner, you ever clear palaces in p5 so fast you gotta wait like 2 weeks in-game time to move to the next one
2017-08-22 11:32:02	zekkin	i stopped playing last night because i got tired of spending evenings improving social stats lol
2017-08-22 11:40:06	tr4656_	_rubik: Yeah make sure you have the trays on the R710 and if you want to do FreeNAS, you need a different NIC
2017-08-22 11:40:35	tr4656_	zekkin: I basically only play like that as a habit from previous Persona games
2017-08-22 11:40:43	tr4656_	Beat palaces in one to two days
2017-08-22 11:41:03	tr4656_	Also gives you max time to improve stats
2017-08-22 11:41:42	zekkin	i had a little trouble with the bank palace
2017-08-22 11:41:45	zekkin	but that was because of team comp
2017-08-22 11:42:14	tr4656_	The first one is really hard to do
2017-08-22 11:42:30	tr4656_	That one is the worst
2017-08-22 11:43:17	tr4656_	Because the problem being you're really item light and have almost no MP to spare to get to the top
2017-08-22 11:43:38	zekkin	yeah that was a pain
2017-08-22 11:43:43	_rubik	tr4656_: Yeah the NIC and raid is funky on the r710 for NAS
2017-08-22 11:43:44	zekkin	but i think i was able to beat the boss first try
2017-08-22 11:43:58	tr4656_	Yeah the boss is a joke
2017-08-22 11:43:59	zekkin	i went through three palaces in the last 3 days
2017-08-22 11:44:09	tr4656_	Did you just get it?
2017-08-22 11:44:16	zekkin	nah i've had it since release
2017-08-22 11:44:26	zekkin	i've actually had the japanese limited edition since it's release as well
2017-08-22 11:44:52	zekkin	i was just busy playing botw, busy with trying to get a new job and moving, didn't get the job so now i'm getting back into playing
2017-08-22 11:45:08	tr4656_	_rubik: Yeah I thought about getting one like two weeks ago so I did a bunch of research into possible NAS/Plex server replacements and such
2017-08-22 11:45:26	tr4656_	But I just wasted my time and didn't get anything
2017-08-22 11:45:45	tr4656_	I feel kind of done with botw
2017-08-22 11:46:01	tr4656_	Not sure evem though I'm not close to finishing everything

2017-08-22 15:29:12	_rubik	But not directly into the pcie obviously. You would need to put powered risers into those 18 slots and then the gpus in the risers

2017-08-23 11:14:25	keveloper	_rubik: WOOOO
2017-08-23 11:14:27	keveloper	what was it
2017-08-23 11:14:49	_rubik	There was some software coding for the newer headlights etc that mine just does have. I have halogen, but it was coded for xenon.
2017-08-23 11:14:55	_rubik	And a few smaller bits.
2017-08-23 11:15:09	_rubik	A valve here. The biggest hit is the water pump needs to be replaced soon.
2017-08-23 11:15:29	_rubik	But its 8 years old and needs to last me 20 more months. So were in business.
2017-08-23 11:15:30	keveloper	:|
2017-08-23 11:15:36	keveloper	how much was it?
2017-08-23 11:15:42	keveloper	also how much will the water pump be
2017-08-23 11:16:37	_rubik	In total. 300 for brake bleed, full detailed inspection, valves, exhaust clamp, recode, and oil.
2017-08-23 11:16:51	keveloper	Oh nice good prive
2017-08-23 11:16:57	keveloper	price*
2017-08-23 11:17:02	_rubik	Yeah Im not upset.
2017-08-23 11:17:12	_rubik	The water pump + thermostat will be 900 though...
2017-08-23 11:17:27	keveloper	eek
2017-08-23 11:17:31	keveloper	Can you make it 20 motnsh
2017-08-23 11:17:39	keveloper	Are you going to trade in or sell private
2017-08-23 11:17:46	_rubik	No. Its made it 8 years :)
2017-08-23 11:17:58	_rubik	Ill trade it in for a 2015 s4 or something.
2017-08-23 11:18:15	keveloper	'or something'
2017-08-23 11:18:34	keveloper	_rubik: saw an S5 sportback 2 days ago I was like :D:D:D:D:<3<3
2017-08-23 11:18:41	_rubik	Just as a heads up, I was talking to an audi tech and tuner. (best in boston), and he said years 09-12 is when they were working out the bugs in b8 engines.
2017-08-23 11:18:49	_rubik	So whatever you do, but 2013 or newer.
2017-08-23 11:18:55	keveloper	That's the plan anyway :D
2017-08-23 11:19:01	keveloper	I almost bought a 2012 a4 though so phew
2017-08-23 11:19:06	_rubik	Well there you go.
2017-08-23 11:19:06	keveloper	(18 months ago)
2017-08-23 11:19:42	_rubik	Yeah I got this sucker in 2012. The engine will need to be rebuilt at some point, but Ill most likely make it the 20 months before that happens.
2017-08-23 11:19:46	keveloper	_rubik: you gonna apr tune that s4? :)
2017-08-23 11:19:54	_rubik	keveloper: Honestly.... maybe not.
2017-08-23 11:20:06	_rubik	I want a tuner car, but I also want a stock daily.
2017-08-23 11:20:12	keveloper	true
2017-08-23 11:20:19	keveloper	isn't apr supposed to be reliable
2017-08-23 11:20:49	_rubik	It is, but it also adds more variables. Stage 1 is super reliable, but Audi cant touch it should I need them too.
2017-08-23 11:21:09	keveloper	is there an ecu upgrade for the s4?
2017-08-23 11:21:16	_rubik	Oh yes.
2017-08-23 11:21:29	keveloper	could audi still not touch that
2017-08-23 11:21:49	_rubik	Nope. They get flagged at the dealership when the ecu has been tuned.
2017-08-23 11:21:57	_rubik	Its voids all warentee.
2017-08-23 11:22:07	keveloper	well if its after 3 years does it really matter
2017-08-23 11:22:34	_rubik	No. But I like to buy CPO, which generally tacks another 2 years onto the warentee.
2017-08-23 11:22:51	keveloper	Ah okay
2017-08-23 11:22:59	keveloper	S4 ECU upgrade: "produces 433-465 HP with 364-385 FT-LBS of torque"  :)
2017-08-23 11:23:41	_rubik	... now think about that with some coilovers, sways, turbo back 2.5" with HFC and cool air intake.
2017-08-23 11:24:01	_rubik	I should say... cat back because its not a turbo engine. Its actually supercharged.
2017-08-23 11:25:23	keveloper	Do the stage II ultracharger apr upgrade for just 541HP and 475 ft-lbs
2017-08-23 11:25:27	keveloper	lol that might a lil too mmuch

2017-08-25 15:30:40	slaytaner	just put friday on full blast on your phone and swag out the door
2017-08-25 15:30:53	_rubik	Im moving out of my apartment this weekend, and Im dreading that...
2017-08-25 15:31:00	cdsboy	moving sucks.
2017-08-25 15:31:05	abbyaha	ohhhh fuck that
2017-08-25 15:31:22	_rubik	Yeah... Packing might be the worst thing of all time.
2017-08-25 15:31:40	_rubik	And I'm not sure who is coming to buy my bed, but Im shit out of luck if they dont come this weekend.
2017-08-25 15:31:53	na_th_an	packing is better than unpacking
2017-08-25 15:32:17	_rubik	Nah unpacking is great. You can take your time and organize everything.
2017-08-25 15:32:19	slaytaner	need to learn to be a minimalist and only own things that are square
2017-08-25 15:32:35	slaytaner	or that fit into square boxes
2017-08-25 15:32:48	_rubik	 I just find that I have so much SHIT
2017-08-25 15:33:54	_rubik	Also, moving bags of clothes is easy. It's computers and monitors etc thats the nightmare.
2017-08-25 15:34:54	slaytaner	I keep the boxes for those
2017-08-25 15:36:06	na_th_an	when I'm packing it doesn't really matter... things go in boxes
2017-08-25 15:36:09	na_th_an	it's like playing tetris
2017-08-25 15:36:12	_rubik	slaytaner: As do I, but still... I want it to stay put. The worst part, I move into my new place in 1 week, so I have to live at my dads in the interum, so I cant really unpack either.
2017-08-25 15:36:15	na_th_an	but when I'm unpacking I have to figure out where shit goes
2017-08-25 15:36:28	na_th_an	_rubik: that's the worst shit
2017-08-25 15:37:12	_rubik	Ill manage.. I think
2017-08-25 15:39:30	na_th_an	I had to do that 2 years ago when I switched apartments
2017-08-25 15:39:32	na_th_an	it was rip
2017-08-25 15:39:46	_rubik	I thought you moved more recently than that..
2017-08-25 15:40:28	na_th_an	I moved 2 years ago and like 2 months ago
2017-08-25 15:43:07	_rubik	I think Ill just go for a walk. Grab some coconut water from upstairs. The works
2017-08-25 15:43:23	_rubik	I got my work done today, all thats left is documentation and Im REALLY not trying to write docs.

2017-08-27 19:27:54	slaytaner	tr4656_ is it just me or is the fate franchise confusing af

2017-08-27 19:29:22	tr4656_	which one are you watching
2017-08-27 19:31:12	slaytaner	mainly the fate/stay night fate/stay night: unlimited blade works thing
2017-08-27 19:43:01	slaytaner	tr4656_ the watch order not the content
2017-08-27 19:43:11	slaytaner	or read order if you include the vns
2017-08-27 19:43:19	tr4656_	dont watch stay night
2017-08-27 19:43:22	tr4656_	its so bad
2017-08-27 19:43:27	tr4656_	its just another route in the vn
2017-08-27 19:48:32	slaytaner	I decided to watch another
2017-08-27 19:50:46	slaytaner	I was gonna watch ergo proxy but CR is having licensing issues apparently
2017-08-27 19:58:21	cdsboy	slaytaner: did you get berzerker to give you access to our plex?
2017-08-27 19:58:26	cdsboy	we should have ergo proxy

2017-08-27 20:30:01	Berzerker	slaytaner: Also there's no watch order to fate. Each series is a different route from the VN
2017-08-27 20:30:13	Berzerker	Treat each differently.

2017-08-28 09:50:21	_rubik	Good news. Got all moved this weekend. Bad news, my buyer for my bed flaked and now I cant get it out of there ...
2017-08-28 09:50:43	abbyaha	burn it
2017-08-28 09:50:46	abbyaha	all
2017-08-28 09:54:54	_rubik	That is clearly the solution. It's such a bed though..
2017-08-28 09:55:30	abbyaha	leave it on the street
2017-08-28 09:56:02	abbyaha	some homeless peeps will be VERY comfortable
2017-08-28 09:57:02	_rubik	abbyaha: I could do that. I called the leasing office today to see if they charge a fee for leaving things behind. Ideally I would sell it.
2017-08-28 09:57:21	abbyaha	they probs will, its p standard
2017-08-28 09:58:01	_rubik	If its like 45 bucks, I can handle that. But if its north of 75 I have to do something about it. Like rent one of those home depot trucks or something.
2017-08-28 10:08:46	na_th_an	if you put it in the street/sidewalk then it becomes the city's problem
2017-08-28 10:08:56	na_th_an	that's what everyone did on campus
2017-08-28 10:50:03	_rubik	The issue is, its not a standard apt. Its part of a development, so its a full on HOA with cameras. It wouldn
2017-08-28 10:50:09	_rubik	wouldnt really fly.
2017-08-28 10:52:36	abbyaha	take the cameras out
2017-08-28 10:54:12	na_th_an	you just have to take it far enough down the street

2017-08-29 11:30:18	arij	i dont do well when there are rules
2017-08-29 11:30:22	shrimp	"Suppose v = vector ST, where S is blah blah and T is blah blah, what vector has the opposite direction and same magnitude as v
2017-08-29 11:30:24	shrimp	"
2017-08-29 11:30:34	shrimp	I put vector TS and it was wrong
2017-08-29 11:30:46	arij	u guys are lucky

2017-08-29 11:37:12	shrimp	ok, someone help me out
2017-08-29 11:37:22	shrimp	webassign is being fuckin stupid
2017-08-29 11:38:53	shrimp	"Suppose v = vector ST, where S = (-1,7,-9) and T = (2,-6,8). What vector has the opposite direction and magnitude as v?
2017-08-29 11:39:30	shrimp	vector TS isn't right, nor is <3,-13,17> or -v
2017-08-29 11:39:49	shrimp	i was gonna try doing vector -ST
2017-08-29 11:41:37	shrimp	that doesn't work either
2017-08-29 11:41:39	shrimp	what the fuck
2017-08-29 11:42:33	_rubik	shrimp: so v is -110 -10 20
2017-08-29 11:43:31	shrimp	_rubik, i don't follow
2017-08-29 11:43:58	_rubik	is v not the cross product of S and T
2017-08-29 11:44:29	shrimp	no
2017-08-29 11:44:53	shrimp	v = vector
2017-08-29 11:45:48	shrimp	"Recall that the magnitude of a vector is also known as the length of the vector. What is the magnitude of the given vector? In general, what is the opposite of an integer k?"
2017-08-29 11:45:53	shrimp	this is the hint they gave
2017-08-29 11:46:00	shrimp	i don't know what the fuck they want
2017-08-29 11:49:12	_rubik	so
2017-08-29 11:50:05	shrimp	so
2017-08-29 11:50:34	_rubik	magnitude of 3d vector ST is the SQRT((X2-X2)^2 + (y2-y2)^2 + (z2-z1)^2)
2017-08-29 11:50:56	shrimp	yes
2017-08-29 11:52:19	_rubik	ah shit I forget angles. Yeah pass
2017-08-29 11:52:47	_rubik	angels** You gotta make your unit vector and do some shit
2017-08-29 11:53:04	_rubik	angles** ggnore
2017-08-29 11:53:41	shrimp	_rubik, it's literally the opposite of this vector
2017-08-29 11:55:00	_rubik	Nah. Because the opposite of a is -a which has the same magnitude but opposite direction
2017-08-29 11:59:06	_rubik	How can something have an opposite magnitude?
2017-08-29 12:01:59	_rubik	if v = ST, then v is {-2, -42, -72}, so -v = {2, 42, -72}... so it should by -ST
2017-08-29 12:02:05	_rubik	yeah what the fuck
2017-08-29 12:08:18	shrimp	nvm lol
2017-08-29 12:08:27	_rubik	wut
2017-08-29 12:08:38	shrimp	it's supposed to be <-3,13,-17>
2017-08-29 12:08:43	shrimp	i figured it out
2017-08-29 12:08:53	_rubik	oh lol
2017-08-29 12:09:05	shrimp	since if you want to find the vector form of ST then you have to do T - S
2017-08-29 12:09:15	shrimp	so vector of TS is S - T
2017-08-29 12:09:46	_rubik	its been years since Ive done this crap
2017-08-29 12:09:47	_rubik	good on you
2017-08-29 12:10:34	_rubik	wait is v = ST what is v
2017-08-29 12:11:19	shrimp	just a variable
2017-08-29 12:11:32	shrimp	they worded it weirdly
2017-08-29 12:11:43	_rubik	err... I mean, what is vector ST
2017-08-29 12:12:01	shrimp	what do you mean
2017-08-29 12:12:10	_rubik	Numerically
2017-08-29 12:12:14	_rubik	In unit form
2017-08-29 12:12:17	shrimp	it's a vector starting at point S and ending at point T
2017-08-29 12:12:18	shrimp	oh
2017-08-29 12:12:20	shrimp	uhh
2017-08-29 12:12:25	_rubik	OH
2017-08-29 12:12:30	_rubik	yo its been far too long
2017-08-29 12:12:37	shrimp	<3,-13,17>
2017-08-29 12:12:38	_rubik	In my mind S and T were vectors
2017-08-29 12:12:42	shrimp	nah
2017-08-29 12:12:45	_rubik	ok
2017-08-29 12:12:46	_rubik	yeah
2017-08-29 12:12:48	shrimp	they're points

2017-08-29 14:14:23	_rubik	heart*
2017-08-29 14:14:42	abbyaha	hmmm, how about you take a whole day, go downtown and pick out a few art rooms to go to, find a pet store that lets you play with puppies, buy her flowers, then end it with a nice dinner
2017-08-29 14:15:27	_rubik	I was thinking art rooms etc in the afternoon and one of those, chef/dinner cooking class things.

2017-08-30 14:49:12	abbyaha	v subjective
2017-08-30 14:49:25	arij	i want to see what  you think though
2017-08-30 14:49:41	arij	i saw the question asked somewhere
2017-08-30 14:49:44	arij	and i didnt know how to answer it

2017-08-30 14:50:07	Slasher	right Roxas
2017-08-30 14:50:08	arij	i didnt eitehr
2017-08-30 14:50:32	Roxas	y-yes?
2017-08-30 14:50:37	arij	i figured its one of those "in the eye of the behodler" typ eof things
2017-08-30 14:50:38	Slasher	nice
2017-08-30 14:50:50	Roxas	what are we talking abotu
2017-08-30 14:50:58	arij	how do you measure success
2017-08-30 14:50:58	keveloper	arij: whats that from
2017-08-30 14:51:04	keveloper	"i totally gave him terrible advice on purpose"
2017-08-30 14:51:06	keveloper	thats from somethingn
2017-08-30 14:51:13	arij	its from the famous quotes of arij
2017-08-30 14:51:24	Roxas	all success is relative
2017-08-30 14:51:37	Roxas	well, most
2017-08-30 14:51:39	keveloper	nope
2017-08-30 14:51:49	arij	i guess its more clear when you are more specific
2017-08-30 14:51:56	keveloper	arij: depends on the person about the success thing
2017-08-30 14:51:58	arij	like financial success, or some other type of success
2017-08-30 14:52:10	Roxas	keveloper: aka relative
2017-08-30 14:52:13	keveloper	measuring financial success is pretty easy
2017-08-30 14:52:21	Roxas	eh
2017-08-30 14:52:29	arij	but just "success"
2017-08-30 14:52:32	Roxas	success for one person could be making rent and putting food on the table
2017-08-30 14:52:33	arij	i guess you cant really answer it
2017-08-30 14:52:34	arij	yea
2017-08-30 14:52:37	keveloper	like general success
2017-08-30 14:52:49	Roxas	while others dont feel successful unless they can afford that 5bd house and a car and the nice stuff etc

2017-08-31 10:49:13	shrimp4	abbyaha, is it a problem with her or with the situation
2017-08-31 10:49:13	cdsboy	shrimp4: If she's great and you guys are actually good to be in a relationship, being friends for 6 months while she works out getting over a LDR will strengthen your potential relationship
2017-08-31 10:49:22	_rubik	cdsboy: true
2017-08-31 10:49:32	arij	long distance relationship? lul

2017-08-31 10:49:49	abbyaha	shrimp4: the situation and i mean...if shes trying to line up someone else before getting the balls to break up with her bf, thats cowardly as fuck
2017-08-31 10:49:52	arij	let it rip!
2017-08-31 10:49:53	_rubik	My 3 year relationship crashed and burned LDR

2017-08-31 10:50:28	arij	abbyaha:  sounds like a good opportunity for shrimp to step in
2017-08-31 10:50:32	shrimp4	the only "lining up" part that she's doing is that she's being friendlier to me
2017-08-31 10:50:41	arij	shrimp4:  just tell her - "daddys here"
2017-08-31 10:50:43	abbyaha	then why is this an issue, if youre "just friends" then no issue
2017-08-31 10:50:45	shrimp4	also, not even 3 months
2017-08-31 10:50:45	abbyaha	find someone else
2017-08-31 10:50:47	arij	then point to your shoulder

2017-08-31 10:51:20	_rubik	Heres what you do.... invite her over for a movie, grab some beer, dont try anything. Nothing. If she likes hanging out with you and sees that your fun, the ball will bounce your way.

2017-08-31 11:45:34	cdsboy	I pretty much only torrent anime that's hard to get

2017-08-31 11:48:18	cdsboy	mkv isn't a codec it's a container

2017-08-31 11:49:32	_rubik	wanna drop some knowledge on me. Certain mkv files cannot run on my mac, but can on my deb box
2017-08-31 11:49:57	cdsboy	I'd guess that you don't have the codec to run w/e the mkv is containing.
2017-08-31 11:50:18	cdsboy	Even if you used something like Haali Media Splitter to extract the source from the mkv it probably still wouldn't play.
2017-08-31 11:50:27	_rubik	That would make sense. Looks like Im going to have to find westworld in a different format.
2017-08-31 11:50:37	cdsboy	or find a codec for it

2017-08-31 15:54:19	keveloper	after like 15-16 i didn't care anymore
2017-08-31 15:54:42	_rubik	I gave up on being a part rat after I nearly bit my tongue off...
2017-08-31 15:54:48	keveloper	lol

2017-08-31 15:55:44	_rubik	:(
2017-08-31 15:55:58	keveloper	lol
2017-08-31 15:56:10	keveloper	_rubik: no matter how good you are you get injured doing park though
2017-08-31 15:56:24	keveloper	the bad people get hurt because they are bad, the good people get hurt because they are trying new things they are bad at
2017-08-31 15:56:32	_rubik	I think I got hurt the most skiing. I played football too..
2017-08-31 15:56:55	slaytaner	i've never been skiing
2017-08-31 15:57:28	_rubik	I think skiing is harder to learn, easier to master. Boarding is easier to learn, harder to master.
2017-08-31 15:57:45	na_th_an	I disagree entirely
2017-08-31 15:57:50	na_th_an	skiing is way easier to learn
2017-08-31 15:57:52	slaytaner	well I went water skiing once
2017-08-31 15:58:12	slaytaner	behind a jet boat
2017-08-31 15:58:26	_rubik	na_th_an: maybe because I learned to ski when I was 2 and skateboarded as a kid. They were simple to pickup
2017-08-31 15:58:34	slaytaner	I thought my arms were gonna pop off
2017-08-31 15:58:55	na_th_an	i learned to ski at like 7 and how to snowboard when I was like 15
2017-08-31 15:59:14	na_th_an	I picked up snowboarding pretty quick but i still think it's way harder than skiing
2017-08-31 15:59:26	slaytaner	:(
2017-08-31 15:59:27	keveloper	slaytaner: water skiing is hard
2017-08-31 15:59:31	keveloper	i wakeboarded though
2017-08-31 15:59:38	na_th_an	water skiing is way harder than snow skiing
2017-08-31 15:59:44	_rubik	agreed.
2017-08-31 15:59:46	keveloper	ya
2017-08-31 15:59:49	slaytaner	I never got to go snow skiing

2017-08-31 16:00:27	keveloper	the only way to actually get decent at snowboarding is to do it like 3 days in a row
2017-08-31 16:00:33	keveloper	thats how i picked it up quickly
2017-08-31 16:00:52	keveloper	i wonder how many hours i've spent snowboarding

2017-09-06 17:02:33	shrimp	Neko-chan, genuine question here
2017-09-06 17:02:45	Neko-chan	ok
2017-09-06 17:03:15	shrimp	Neko-chan, if someone asks for forgiveness for something that you don't really forgive people for since it's so minor, do you say it's ok or you don't have to apologise
2017-09-06 17:05:22	Neko-chan	shrimp: I usually get them into a private, neutral space, buy them a coffee or whatever and then scream and cry at them about totally unrelated problems that they have no ability to affect
2017-09-06 17:05:37	shrimp	Neko-chan, ok
2017-09-06 17:05:39	Neko-chan	sometimes I'll meet up with someone and scream "YOU DON'T FUCKING UNDERSTAND" over and over
2017-09-06 17:05:45	Neko-chan	shrimp: Just forgive them
2017-09-06 17:05:49	Neko-chan	why is that even a question
2017-09-06 17:05:53	shrimp	Neko-chan, idk
2017-09-06 17:06:06	Neko-chan	shrimp: genuine question
2017-09-06 17:06:16	shrimp	Neko-chan, i'm bad at talking to people and didn't do the one you said
2017-09-06 17:06:16	Neko-chan	why do you spend so much time overthinking relatively simple things?
2017-09-06 17:06:19	shrimp	idk
2017-09-06 17:06:31	Neko-chan	I'm bad at talking to people too
2017-09-06 17:06:54	shrimp	Neko-chan, me and k are going to the art museum tomorrow
2017-09-06 17:07:08	Neko-chan	nice
2017-09-06 17:07:13	Neko-chan	I have been to that art museum
2017-09-06 17:07:25	shrimp	they haven't changed much though
2017-09-06 17:07:29	shrimp	so it'll be the same shit
2017-09-06 17:07:35	shrimp	and i went last weekend

2017-09-06 17:16:54	Neko-chan	and if after hanging out with them you decide you don't like them anymore, you can just leave
2017-09-06 17:17:09	Neko-chan	Most people understand that feelings can change
2017-09-06 17:17:15	Neko-chan	so just stop worrying, okay shrimp?

2017-09-06 17:17:45	shrimp	i've been spending most of my time with her anyways
2017-09-06 17:17:54	Neko-chan	Yeah, just keep doing that.
2017-09-06 17:18:08	cdsboy	Here's a benchmark for you: Stop obsessing about asking her out and just hangout w/ her for a month
2017-09-06 17:18:21	cdsboy	If after a month you're still interested, then come back and get advice on how to ask her out properly
2017-09-06 17:19:08	cdsboy	If in the meantime something happens, just let it happen instead of planning it
2017-09-06 17:19:31	Neko-chan	or just show up at her room in the middle of the night and scream your confession through the closed door
2017-09-06 17:19:46	cdsboy	that might work too
2017-09-06 17:19:54	shrimp	okay
2017-09-06 17:19:59	cdsboy	Although, it might piss her roommate off, which you don't want to do
2017-09-06 17:20:04	Neko-chan	and then when she opens the door, run away, then drop out of school and spend the rest of your life wondering how things "could have gone"
2017-09-06 17:20:13	cdsboy	pretty hard to have sex if the roommate won't play ball and give you guys space
2017-09-06 17:20:14	shrimp	her roommate is friends with her

2017-09-09 14:36:04	_rubik	ram is good. Have you parted out the rest of the machines?
2017-09-09 14:47:50	arij	For the most part
2017-09-09 14:47:58	arij	No one's buying the psus though

2017-09-09 15:06:39	_rubik	Or do you just want to dump it :)

2017-09-10 20:14:42	tr4656_	I'm actually kind of interested
2017-09-10 20:23:03	arij	i used a silicon mold
2017-09-10 20:23:08	arij	then i used epoxy resin to cast the keycap
2017-09-10 20:23:31	arij	im doing all the mods with the camo pattern
2017-09-10 20:23:36	arij	i just ran out of silicon :(

2017-09-10 20:42:30	arij	other than that youll need pigment for whatever colors you want
2017-09-10 20:42:39	arij	something for stirring like some wooden dowels
2017-09-10 20:42:52	arij	and some kind of square container to pour the silicon into for making the mold
2017-09-10 20:42:54	arij	thats really it
2017-09-10 20:43:03	arij	can get some glitter and stuff if you want to get all fancy
2017-09-10 20:43:29	arij	i made my molds using my stock hhkb keycaps and theyre fine after - you cant even tell i used them
2017-09-10 20:43:56	arij	but i did go through a few containers of everything before i started getting better at it
2017-09-10 20:44:09	arij	can def walk you through the steps tho
2017-09-10 20:44:57	arij	oh and i have some clay - i used that for making the mold
2017-09-10 20:45:29	arij	clay is for filling the stem of topre keycaps so they arent so flimsy after being cast
2017-09-10 20:45:42	arij	so its more like a solid stem rather than just the two prongs or whatever
2017-09-10 20:46:06	arij	also when youre making the mold you use the clay as a base to push the keycap onto so its like airtight on the bottom and the silicon doesnt leak where it shouldnt if that makes sense
2017-09-11 01:22:18	slaytaner	tr4656_ have you seen all of k-on?

2017-09-11 13:36:47	arij	so i dont know what youre talking about
2017-09-11 13:36:53	Lanth	Too many communities completely unrelated to video games are moving to discord
2017-09-11 13:36:56	keveloper	arij: where di that come from
2017-09-11 13:37:13	Lanth	And yeah, it's probably better than TS/Vent, but it only really makes sense for video games
2017-09-11 13:37:16	arij	abby thinks i hate women or something
2017-09-11 13:37:24	keveloper	Lanth: thats all i use it for ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2017-09-11 13:38:57	slaytaner	I've been to the mechboards discord twice and both times saw swastikas in the main channel
2017-09-11 13:38:59	Lanth	abbyaha: I could see it being useful for that
2017-09-11 13:39:00	keveloper	abbyaha: that is a game tho
2017-09-11 13:39:16	keveloper	slaytaner: sign me up

2017-09-11 13:42:37	slaytaner	chat is probably all pictures

2017-09-12 10:07:47	Lanth	His wife is super nice though
2017-09-12 10:09:13	Lanth	But anyway, talking with him basically starts out with him making sure you know how big of a deal he is, and then a long rant about whatever libtard fantasy he's living out at the moment :P
2017-09-12 10:10:03	Lanth	(if you're in the northeast and actually wanna meet him, feel free to PM :P)

2017-09-13 12:38:55	slaytaner	tbf it works best with macos
2017-09-13 12:39:05	tr4656_	I think the Elecom thumbball is stil technically a better one (because better sensor) and cheaper
2017-09-13 12:40:10	tr4656_	Magic Trackpad is actually pretty good
2017-09-13 12:41:33	slaytaner	for everything but gaming and probably editing/3d work it is the best

2017-09-13 13:20:20	slaytaner	rust is gross
2017-09-13 13:21:45	_rubik	slaytaner: is esxi written in Rust?
2017-09-13 13:23:00	slaytaner	no 3.5 sas drives
2017-09-13 13:23:17	slaytaner	spinning rust
2017-09-13 13:23:22	slaytaner	flash4lyfe
2017-09-13 13:23:30	_rubik	ahh that kind of rust
2017-09-13 13:24:18	_rubik	slaytaner: last time I checked, Im not about to build a NAS with 2.5s or ssds
2017-09-13 13:24:37	slaytaner	why esxi
2017-09-13 13:24:51	slaytaner	why not kvm
2017-09-13 13:26:02	_rubik	I haven't worked with either, but it seems like vmware is the call in industry. And getting that experience is helpful, no?
2017-09-13 13:28:08	slaytaner	they all use different stuff
2017-09-13 13:28:13	slaytaner	aws uses xen
2017-09-13 13:29:05	_rubik	Interesting. I would love to know xen v esxi
2017-09-13 13:29:14	_rubik	pro/con style.
2017-09-13 13:29:35	slaytaner	I think esxi is more of a thing you use with smaller deployments
2017-09-13 13:29:54	na_th_an	my company uses esxi
2017-09-13 13:30:10	na_th_an	and it definitely seems like esxi is the favorite on r/homelab
2017-09-13 13:30:34	_rubik	homelab gushes over esxi
2017-09-13 13:31:07	slaytaner	anyway it's proprietary garbage so fuck it and fuck vmware
2017-09-13 13:31:17	slaytaner	:D
2017-09-13 13:31:34	_rubik	yeah I do hate the fucking propri model
2017-09-13 13:31:42	_rubik	Its pay to play as hell
2017-09-13 13:32:25	_rubik	slaytaner: Im glad you pointed out xen. Ill be doing some reading tonight.
2017-09-13 13:33:45	na_th_an	unraid is the first proprietary OS I've used in a long time (for anything other than gaming)
2017-09-13 13:34:36	_rubik	Im really debating between unraid and zfs on freenas.
2017-09-13 13:34:48	slaytaner	zfs
2017-09-13 13:34:58	_rubik	I love zfs, but I think unraid and its ability to add drives is very appealing.
2017-09-13 13:35:09	slaytaner	adding drives is lame
2017-09-13 13:35:15	_rubik	I dont think I can pull together 8x 8tb drives at once.
2017-09-13 13:35:21	slaytaner	rip
2017-09-13 13:35:26	slaytaner	also rip 8tb drives
2017-09-13 13:35:29	_rubik	.i _rubik
2017-09-13 13:35:30	magic_conch	_rubik: bananahead
2017-09-13 13:36:08	slaytaner	zfs is a ricers filesystem
2017-09-13 13:36:47	_rubik	in what setting are we using ricer? Cause Im not asian nor do I drive a riced x86
2017-09-13 13:37:24	slaytaner	ricer in the tuning sense
2017-09-13 13:37:43	slaytaner	like heavily modified honda civics
2017-09-13 13:38:22	_rubik	The drawback to zfs is that I need to get all my drives together before I set it up
2017-09-13 13:38:30	_rubik	so its must more of an initial investment.
2017-09-13 13:39:22	slaytaner	yeah
2017-09-13 13:39:59	arij	unraid is great
2017-09-13 13:40:13	arij	and if you never shut the server off you dont have to pay lol
2017-09-13 13:40:38	arij	until.. the cleaning lady unplugs it to plug the vacuum in... smh
2017-09-13 13:40:52	_rubik	please tell me that happened to you
2017-09-13 13:40:56	arij	it did lol
2017-09-13 13:41:01	_rubik	RIP
2017-09-13 13:41:14	_rubik	that cleaning lady cost you a bit more than you initially thought
2017-09-13 13:41:23	arij	haha yea
2017-09-13 13:42:14	slaytaner	eww propritary software
2017-09-13 13:42:22	arij	is freenas better?
2017-09-13 13:42:36	_rubik	imo yes
2017-09-13 13:42:43	_rubik	But adding drives is supa hot fire
2017-09-13 13:42:43	slaytaner	it doesn't cost anything
2017-09-13 13:43:27	_rubik	I forget. Zfs is good when you have mismatched drives correct?
2017-09-13 13:44:53	tr4656_	FreeNAS is more work to setup
2017-09-13 13:45:03	tr4656_	slaytaner: https://i.redd.it/g5cbvwyfwllz.jpg
2017-09-13 13:45:14	_rubik	NAH. Freenas is much easier than pfsense for example.
2017-09-13 13:45:54	slaytaner	loooooooool
2017-09-13 13:45:55	tr4656_	Okay but that's a completely different thing
2017-09-13 13:46:03	slaytaner	lol pfsense is a firewall
2017-09-13 13:46:07	_rubik	yes
2017-09-13 13:46:09	_rubik	Im aware
2017-09-13 13:46:19	arij	that iphone is pretty cool actually
2017-09-13 13:46:19	tr4656_	Constructing a building is also harder
2017-09-13 13:46:25	arij	and i dont like apple products
2017-09-13 13:46:36	arij	but $1000? that thing costs more than my truck...
2017-09-13 13:46:37	_rubik	But in terms of homelabbing, freenas is on the easier end
2017-09-13 13:46:38	slaytaner	anyway I'm off to the gym
2017-09-13 13:46:50	_rubik	arij: thats not saying much ;)

2017-09-15 15:22:03	tr4656_	i didn't preorder the 8+ today so I guess so
2017-09-15 15:22:09	abbyaha	lol
2017-09-15 15:22:15	na_th_an	also lol
2017-09-15 15:24:47	tr4656_	i mean i was planning to upgrade
2017-09-15 15:24:57	tr4656_	so i guess i basically talked myself into getting an X
2017-09-15 15:25:19	abbyaha	it is tempting and i JUST got the s8+ and i love it
2017-09-15 15:25:24	abbyaha	i just like apple watches a lot
2017-09-15 15:25:29	na_th_an	why tho
2017-09-15 15:26:05	na_th_an	i spent $600 on my pixel and I think that's too much for a phone honestly
2017-09-15 15:26:19	na_th_an	my next phone probably won't be a brand new flagship
2017-09-15 15:27:53	arij	i was waiting for pixel 2
2017-09-15 15:28:15	arij	am waiting for
2017-09-15 15:30:33	na_th_an	i might have been interested in the pixel 2 if google weren't cucks
2017-09-15 15:30:42	na_th_an	headphone jack or fuck you
2017-09-15 15:31:09	slaytaner	lol headphone jack
2017-09-15 15:31:20	slaytaner	I use the adapter on my iphone 6
2017-09-15 15:32:37	na_th_an	i'm not gonna carry around an adapter so I can use a headphone jack
2017-09-15 15:32:45	na_th_an	I also like to be able to charge and listen to music
2017-09-15 15:33:01	arij	how do you know it doesnt have a headphone jack
2017-09-15 15:33:03	arij	its not even out yet
2017-09-15 15:35:34	tr4656_	slaytaner: Are you uisng an Campfire Andro or something
2017-09-15 15:35:47	tr4656_	I mean the main thing to use the adapter if you havea  headphone jack is the lower noise floor
2017-09-15 15:36:30	tr4656_	na_th_an: I agree which is why I only bought the Pixel Xl on sale and then sold it a few month later
2017-09-15 15:37:25	tr4656_	abbyaha: Apple watches are  nice but also not as nice looking as an analog watch imo except maybe the black ceramic
2017-09-15 15:54:05	Slasher	tr4656_: They look nice enough https://i.imgur.com/qC5Zoty.jpg

2017-09-15 15:55:58	tr4656_	i agree i wear mine sometimes
2017-09-15 15:56:13	tr4656_	but im also kind of a watch nerd so in comparison its not as nice
2017-09-15 15:56:25	tr4656_	and i think square isn't as good as round just in general
2017-09-15 15:56:45	tr4656_	the bands are very nice
2017-09-15 15:57:24	na_th_an	yeah I like round a lot more than square
2017-09-15 15:58:51	abbyaha	i like the square
2017-09-15 15:58:58	abbyaha	and the rose gold/pink
2017-09-15 15:59:01	na_th_an	you are a square
2017-09-15 15:59:05	abbyaha	:O
2017-09-15 15:59:46	tr4656_	I want the new black ceramic
2017-09-15 16:00:07	abbyaha	i like the combo of the rose gold with the blue band
2017-09-15 16:00:10	abbyaha	looks v nice imo
2017-09-15 16:01:35	tr4656_	It is nice
2017-09-15 16:03:59	tr4656_	I think Apple straps are all very high quality as well

2017-09-15 16:05:45	na_th_an	I used it for a few weeks before it broke
2017-09-15 16:06:07	na_th_an	i kinda can't stand to wear watches I think. it was always either too loose or too tight
2017-09-15 16:06:13	tr4656_	Terrible
2017-09-15 16:06:48	tr4656_	Well for that just find a strap that fits you
2017-09-15 16:07:06	tr4656_	It's not like there are standard sizes other than for lugs
2017-09-15 16:12:43	Slasher	Ya I like the nylon band I have
2017-09-15 16:12:55	Slasher	had milanese, ripped arm hair though
2017-09-15 16:13:41	na_th_an	I kept meaning to get a new band but never got around to it
2017-09-15 16:13:47	na_th_an	I only paid $80 for the watch
2017-09-15 16:49:33	arij	gotta add those links

2017-09-16 02:19:19	slaytaner	the premise is absurd, but somehow it manages to have a good story
2017-09-16 02:19:41	slaytaner	probably fairly generic sports anime
2017-09-16 02:19:45	slaytaner	but still
2017-09-16 02:20:22	tr4656_	I definitely would say it's decent

2017-09-17 13:02:11	_rubik	Logic textbook :/
2017-09-17 13:05:45	slaytaner	ooooh which logic
2017-09-17 13:06:45	_rubik	Its a broad lecture. It covers both inductive and deductive.
2017-09-17 13:07:27	slaytaner	oh so babbys first propositional logic
2017-09-17 13:07:33	_rubik	Nailed it.
2017-09-17 13:07:51	_rubik	I just find is to ride this awkward line between subjective and objective reasoning.
2017-09-17 13:08:08	_rubik	Diagraming various arguments seems so methodical... but its not
2017-09-17 13:08:22	slaytaner	oooh is it a philosophy course?

2017-09-17 13:10:32	slaytaner	lame
2017-09-17 13:10:36	slaytaner	math is great
2017-09-17 13:10:40	_rubik	As a cs guy, applied math is really all I need. Now I want to exercise the philosophy side.
2017-09-17 13:10:48	_rubik	Thinking about how to think. Thats the fun stuff
2017-09-17 13:10:54	slaytaner	you know CS is math right?
2017-09-17 13:11:40	_rubik	You know Ill never develop new theories begind combinatorics right?
2017-09-17 13:12:10	slaytaner	that's probably one of the easiest math fields to do that in atm
2017-09-17 13:12:11	_rubik	I mean, I have to understand it to utilize it properly, but after linear, things start becoming less and less needed.
2017-09-17 13:12:52	slaytaner	graph theory is pretty important
2017-09-17 13:13:14	_rubik	Really all discrete math is
2017-09-17 13:13:52	slaytaner	I'll concede you don't really need calculus for a lot of cs
2017-09-17 13:14:01	_rubik	calc is shite
2017-09-17 13:14:17	slaytaner	it's just tedious algebra
2017-09-17 13:14:20	_rubik	The sad part is, thats as far as most folks get before they quit math.
2017-09-17 13:14:26	slaytaner	the calc part is really simple
2017-09-17 13:14:47	_rubik	Linear gave me a hard time because I was working in theorical n degree spaces.
2017-09-17 13:14:56	_rubik	I wish I could go back and retake it.
2017-09-17 13:15:36	slaytaner	algebra is the worst
2017-09-17 13:16:26	slaytaner	modern algebra is also important for programming language theory though
2017-09-17 13:16:57	_rubik	I wish I didnt have to take so many shitty requirement classes. Like history.
2017-09-17 13:17:12	_rubik	If I could, it would be 100% phil, cs, and math

2017-09-17 13:21:01	slaytaner	then again I have a stem and a liberal arts degree

2017-09-24 14:20:09	tr4656_	with 147GB
