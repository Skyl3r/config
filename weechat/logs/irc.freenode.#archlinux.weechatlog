2017-01-09 18:43:53	itsxaos	i think it must happen when it resumes from hibernate / sleep

2017-01-09 18:44:05	Andronas	Namarrgon: Didn't fix GNOME. :/ I tried re logging in, and restarting
2017-01-09 18:44:42	PatrolDoom	itsxaos: yeah that's possible, could be some weird power settings. hrm, when the device disappears, is the module still loaded? can you load/unload to reprobe?
2017-01-09 18:45:08	itsxaos	im gonna do that now
2017-01-09 18:45:10	itsxaos	so

2017-01-09 18:45:23	cryzed	Andronas, the problem is that alsamixer allows you to change the volume but the gnome applet doesnt?

2017-01-09 18:45:30	Andronas	cryzed: exactly
2017-01-09 18:45:32	cryzed	Maybe the gnome applet is trying to change a different pulseaudio channel

2017-01-09 18:45:51	cryzed	sinks they were called I think
2017-01-09 18:46:05	Andronas	cryzed: the Sound applet in GNOME doesn't show any devices available for sound output
