2016-10-14 13:45:05	keveloper	solrac: you cant by the definition of abstract class
2016-10-14 13:45:36	solrac	I'm trying to save information into an class(non monobehaviour) so I can save/load data into it
2016-10-14 13:45:37	keveloper	You could extend the abstract class and instantiate that class. Or make it not an abstract class
2016-10-14 13:46:26	solrac	extend? What do you mean? And would it be safer to remove the abstract? As in like, can I continue using it as a save info object?
2016-10-14 13:47:51	keveloper	Its when you do public class B : A
2016-10-14 13:48:08	keveloper	Why is it an abstract class in the first place?
2016-10-14 13:48:24	fholm	the whole idea of abstract classes is that you sh ould NOT make instances of them :P

2016-10-14 14:46:31	Dynasty	the contractors provide an estimate up front as well
2016-10-14 14:46:40	bobross	Dynasty because a milestone is up to your discretion and you could rationalize not paying someone
2016-10-14 14:46:52	bobross	Dynasty no one has any idea how long something will take
2016-10-14 14:46:53	Dynasty	and I only pay them within the estimated hours
2016-10-14 14:47:13	tzaeru	Dynasty, if you have somekinda link with more info, I can paste it to some people
2016-10-14 14:47:21	Dynasty	actually the milestone is in the contract
2016-10-14 14:47:22	tzaeru	though they might not have the time
2016-10-14 14:47:25	Dynasty	it's very straightforward
2016-10-14 14:47:30	bobross	Dynasty the only people who would do something like that are the people who have never been burned by it before
2016-10-14 14:47:40	tzaeru	but a few freelancer pals are pretty experienced with vfx and unity
2016-10-14 14:48:48	Dynasty	bobross here's an example milestone: Complete 20 hat models from the hat list
2016-10-14 14:48:49	bobross	Dynasty all the risk is on the freelance and the rate is pretty low for an independent contractor
2016-10-14 14:48:52	tzaeru	bobross, well, freelancing's always a bit like that, never know what kinda project you go into. but apparently some prefer that riskiness over steady hours.
2016-10-14 14:49:05	Dynasty	what is not clear about that?
2016-10-14 14:49:11	tzaeru	..I wouldn't, dealing with contractees @_@
2016-10-14 14:49:15	bobross	Dynasty you have to approve the hats
2016-10-14 14:49:29	tzaeru	I mean, dealing with random contractees of whom you've only slim guarantees.
2016-10-14 14:49:50	Dynasty	yeah, no way I'm paying for bad hats
2016-10-14 14:49:57	Dynasty	of course I have to approve them
2016-10-14 14:50:13	Dynasty	the risk is going both ways
2016-10-14 14:50:14	bobross	tzaeru right, and I've never ever seen someone pay after the work has been delivered
2016-10-14 14:50:50	bobross	Dynasty but for someone who is very capable, they could get plenty of work, so turning down a job like that is not nearly as risky as taking it
2016-10-14 14:50:52	tzaeru	bobross, uh, I think I used the wrong word there. I meant that dealing with people who offer contracts as a freelancer would not be my thing at all
2016-10-14 14:51:05	tzaeru	due to the difficulty of gaining enough guarantees as someone who takes such contracts.

2016-10-14 16:08:52	peroht	it is just such a pita
2016-10-14 16:15:54	bobross	peroht I don't quite understand, why cull baked lights?
2016-10-14 16:17:59	peroht	bobross: just like for realtime lights i want to be able to select which static objects should be lit with baked lights
2016-10-14 16:18:45	bobross	peroht you want to turn the lightmapping off or you want to turn specific lights off?
2016-10-14 16:19:09	peroht	i want specific lights to affect specific objects
2016-10-14 16:19:57	bobross	peroht you may be able to do that while baking, but not at runtime since that would require different maps
2016-10-14 16:20:24	peroht	e.g. baking some light on objects over here and bake light in an area 200 m away
2016-10-14 16:21:05	peroht	well i am trying to do it while baking but it does not work as i expect it with the "culling mask"
2016-10-14 16:21:31	peroht	its basically this
2016-10-14 16:21:31	peroht	https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/cullingmask-lightmapping-ignores-lights-culling-mask
2016-10-14 16:22:01	bobross	peroht I'm also working on a light mapping plugin - https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/72162 - I don't know enough about enlighten to say how to do that, I have a lot of trouble getting anything out of it
2016-10-14 16:22:54	bobross	peroht now that I know about that, I might be able to use the culling mask myself

2016-10-14 16:24:50	bobross	peroht there are so many quirks to unity's lightmapping it is ridiculous
2016-10-14 16:25:13	peroht	yes something i didnt expect for a pro license.
2016-10-14 16:25:25	peroht	:)
2016-10-14 16:25:44	peroht	but again it is more complex than i'd ever understand
2016-10-14 16:25:48	bobross	well it isn't as if they fix bugs in the pro version only
2016-10-14 16:26:30	bobross	peroht not really, I've written a totally new lightmapping system and all my time has been spent dealing with strange unity integration
2016-10-14 16:26:50	peroht	no no i didnt specifically talk about the pro version. wrong wording there. what i meant is that culling mask is not honored.
2016-10-14 16:27:14	peroht	which "degrades" the software to sub-pro level :)
2016-10-14 16:27:24	 *	peroht is still very happy with unity
2016-10-14 16:27:41	bobross	peroht yeah for some reason there are lots of bugs and when you search them you see people reporting them in 2015, 2014, 2013...
2016-10-14 16:29:37	peroht	hmm if a bug has been postponed is there anyway of seeing if/where it has ended in a roadmap somewhere? if you know that?
2016-10-14 16:30:25	bobross	peroht I don't know, I just usually see someone from unity assume it's the users' fault and give suggestion which doesn't fix the problem

2016-10-15 00:33:51	BadgerMeles	Is there any reason to choose a Behaviour[] array over a List<Behaviour>? Beyond the differences from a non-unity/general-programming standpoint. The editor seems to treat them the same.
2016-10-15 00:34:19	shinyclef	I don't know of any
2016-10-15 00:35:06	shinyclef	There 'might' be a different in memory allocations...?
2016-10-15 00:35:11	BadgerMeles	From a general standpoint, arrays are (typically) faster - so I'm inclined to default to them, if my *use* of them doesn't warrent a List<>.

2016-10-15 00:43:50	BadgerMeles	Oh. Your rfid is *probably* sending it as keystrokes, yeah. Which means it'll be _fast_, but not *simultanious*. So just processing the inputs in an Update() probably would be sufficient.
2016-10-15 00:44:46	BadgerMeles	Have you tried just using GetKeyDown() inside Update()? Just see what happens, if it's sufficient?
2016-10-15 00:45:10	shinyclef	more information about this case is required :)
2016-10-15 00:45:18	fadhilahnp	its return number in sequence, but I want one chip for one command, if using update its read every keydown
2016-10-15 00:45:32	shinyclef	fadhilahnp,
2016-10-15 00:45:40	shinyclef	do you know when the scan is happening?

2016-10-15 00:48:47	fadhilahnp	when I put the chip on rfid and then rfid send 10 number in squencial, I think its need half second to complete

2016-10-15 00:49:24	shinyclef	fadhilahnp, is there any indication to know that 'Sequance Is Beginning Now'
2016-10-15 00:49:26	SigilObscura_	BadgerMeles, not that I know of offhand.  There might be some edge case running around
2016-10-15 00:49:35	shinyclef	or literally, it's randomly going to send input
2016-10-15 00:49:43	BadgerMeles	When I was doing barcode scanner coding - the barcode scanner, would send an EOL after the last digit. So you'd know it was 'done'.
2016-10-15 00:49:59	shinyclef	if you know that for example "The next 10 keys will be my code"
2016-10-15 00:50:02	shinyclef	then it's easy
2016-10-15 00:50:29	shinyclef	if there's other input in the game and at random any ten could be your code, it's not so easy
2016-10-15 00:50:36	fadhilahnp	yes, its work similar to barcode scanner
2016-10-15 00:50:48	BadgerMeles	shinyclef: Unless there's a fault >:) Then you could accidently offset everything. Unless you put a timer in to reset back to '0 position' after X miliseconds.
2016-10-15 00:51:00	shinyclef	yeah I'm done guessing
2016-10-15 00:51:16	shinyclef	I can think of multiple ways to achieve different things
2016-10-15 00:51:19	shinyclef	but this use case is unclear
2016-10-15 00:51:28	BadgerMeles	fadhilahnp: My suggestion is checking for keys 0-9, and Enter. That 'Enter' should give you the signal "Done submitting numbers".
2016-10-15 00:51:32	SigilObscura_	BadgerMeles: most of the time when this question comes up it's unnecessary optimization when people think List is a completely different data structure, but that doesn't apply here I don't think
2016-10-15 00:52:28	BadgerMeles	SigilObscura_: Yawp, I'm not obsessing over it. Just thought I'd ask since I was creating something using it, and for the first time in a long time found myself *not* needing a List.. and wondered.. should I use one anyway? Hahah. I did not, btw >;)
2016-10-15 00:53:23	BadgerMeles	fadhilahnp: Just be aware of faults. If the 'Enter' key is missed for whatever reason, that current scan *and* your next scan will be invalid. (Somewhat negated with a timer reset)

2016-10-15 00:59:33	BadgerMeles	shinyclef: As long as the # keys are only for reader input, wsda movement shouldn't interfere - if written that way.
2016-10-15 00:59:44	shinyclef	yes true
2016-10-15 00:59:57	shinyclef	but still stands for number keys
2016-10-15 01:00:05	shinyclef	are number keys also part of user input
2016-10-15 01:01:07	 *	MisterSyntax messages his party ; "i just got 1234 xp for this monster" , ends up with some unintential sequence entered in
2016-10-15 01:01:31	shinyclef	haha yes
2016-10-15 01:01:31	BadgerMeles	If I want to draw a line between two uUI nodes, there's no special thing I'm missing, right? Just make an Image, set it's position/rotation/scale to simulate a line?
2016-10-15 01:01:37	shinyclef	or interrupts an RFID sequence
2016-10-15 01:01:47	MisterSyntax	if you just handle any and all user input from the same script, you can exclude such unintentional interactions of input
2016-10-15 01:01:55	MisterSyntax	just a thought
2016-10-15 01:01:57	BadgerMeles	Or whatever Unity-UI is shorthanded to.

2016-10-15 01:06:43	shinyclef	etc
2016-10-15 01:06:56	shinyclef	1234 and 1324
2016-10-15 01:07:03	shinyclef	if 23 arrive in same frame
2016-10-15 01:07:17	shinyclef	anyway, yeah, would need to know more details :)

2016-10-15 01:10:41	sandeep_tfg	Hey, what should I preffer XML or JSON for saving data on the storage for my game ? I'm asking from the security point of view.
2016-10-15 01:11:10	shinyclef	I can't think of a reason why this matter from a security point of view
2016-10-15 01:11:46	sandeep_tfg	We are working on a multiplayer game
2016-10-15 01:11:59	shinyclef	both formats are text serialization
2016-10-15 01:12:09	shinyclef	I don't think either is more secure
2016-10-15 01:12:23	shinyclef	but json is less 'verbose' if you're thinking of sending stuff over the wire in multiplayer
2016-10-15 01:13:25	-->	Japa (~Japa@103.18.170.137) has joined #unity3d
2016-10-15 01:13:31	sandeep_tfg	to minimize network usage, I'm saving data locally and syncing when needed
2016-10-15 01:14:01	sandeep_tfg	but afriad that a developer can edit the stored file before it is synced over the network
2016-10-15 01:14:12	BadgerMeles	sandeep_tfg: I recommend binary, encrypted. But that's just me >:)
2016-10-15 01:14:16	shinyclef	then I would say 'from a security point of view' neither has an advantage.
2016-10-15 01:14:29	shinyclef	they are both editable etc
2016-10-15 01:14:44	shinyclef	if you're worried about security, this format is not the thing you need to care about
2016-10-15 01:14:51	shinyclef	think about encryption maybe?
2016-10-15 01:15:13	shinyclef	yes BadgerMeles has the better option for security haha
2016-10-15 01:15:14	sandeep_tfg	So you are saying I can save in any format but encrypt data before saving ?
2016-10-15 01:15:19	BadgerMeles	If you're trying to avoid editing, encrypted is really your only option. If you encrypt it, format is moot. Could be JSON, XML, plain text, doesn't matter... encrypted is encrypted. (Now, the level of your encryption, to be crackable, is another thing)
2016-10-15 01:15:56	BadgerMeles	I personally prefer binary for storage and packet payload, because it's smaller. If you transmit binary, it'll (typically) be much smaller than Rest or Soap.
2016-10-15 01:16:25	sandeep_tfg	Thank You shinyclef and BadgerMeles
2016-10-15 01:16:34	shinyclef	look at ProtoBuffers :)
2016-10-15 01:16:43	BadgerMeles	I recomend TLV packet format (Type-Length-Value), where L is optional depending on Type. (eg: If 'type' is an int, you don't need to send a 'length' byte.. since int is always 4 bytes)
2016-10-15 01:16:47	shinyclef	that's sometimes nice for serialization
2016-10-15 01:17:17	shinyclef	https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/
2016-10-15 01:17:49	shinyclef	standard binary serializer in c# kind of delicate
2016-10-15 01:17:57	shinyclef	cause if you class changes at all it will break
2016-10-15 01:18:21	shinyclef	protobuf tags your attributes so you can add more later
2016-10-15 01:18:26	shinyclef	and it will still deserialize
2016-10-15 01:18:30	shinyclef	and it's all faster and smaller

2016-10-15 01:20:14	shinyclef	it's a smaller and faster form of binary serialization than c#'s standart binary serializer
2016-10-15 01:20:24	shinyclef	and also less prone to breaking
2016-10-15 01:20:40	shinyclef	I highly recommend to you if you are big on binary serialization
2016-10-15 01:20:55	BadgerMeles	Oh, huh. I see, 'binary format' - interesting.
2016-10-15 01:21:00	shinyclef	Developed by  Google
2016-10-15 01:21:25	shinyclef	have a read, it's very good, fast, smaller, more robust :D
2016-10-15 01:22:39	BadgerMeles	Yeah, I'll have to look into this. I did all my own binary encoding... in C# *and* Java. Since my server is Java, but client is Unity/C#.
2016-10-15 01:22:59	BadgerMeles	Since Unity doesn't play nice as a proper Server >:P Sadly. Annoyingly. Frustraitingly.
2016-10-15 01:23:00	shinyclef	protobuf is also language-neutral :)

2016-10-15 07:34:37	Zolden	it would be cool if unity did anything on gpu by default
2016-10-15 07:35:02	Zolden	lots of tasks would benefit alot from gpu computational resources
2016-10-15 07:36:43	Zolden	currently physics can be recreated from scratch and computed with compute shader on gpu, but there's a bottleneck, getting data from video memory takes too long, maybe 0.05 seconds sometimes

2016-10-15 07:42:21	Tripknotix	since you chose particles
2016-10-15 07:43:19	Tripknotix	what im noticing is a trend with a bottleneck with bandwidth on vulkan, and im thinking mobile devices may not open up fast enough for that
2016-10-15 07:43:33	UnicornForest	Tripknotix: it's defualt shuriken particle system is also on the cpu

2016-10-15 07:50:13	ciwolsey	whats the deal with null references showing up everywhere when you reload a scene in unity?
2016-10-15 07:50:40	ciwolsey	i have two scenes i just want to switch between, which work fine on their own
2016-10-15 07:50:49	ciwolsey	but when going from one to the other all hell breaks loose
2016-10-15 07:50:54	Tripknotix	Zolden: im more looking towards bandwidth
2016-10-15 07:50:58	Tripknotix	nvidia went downwards in bandwdith
2016-10-15 07:51:19	Tripknotix	its why vulkan runs the same as dx11 on on 1080 and below
2016-10-15 07:51:29	Tripknotix	the titan tho that one has higher bandwidth and does kick ass
2016-10-15 07:52:04	Tripknotix	how do you use gpu particles zolden

2016-10-15 07:53:12	ciwolsey	seems a complete mess
2016-10-15 07:53:33	DooblyNoobly	they go away when you clear console ciwolsey?
2016-10-15 07:53:51	ciwolsey	null reference exceptions
2016-10-15 07:53:53	ciwolsey	so for example
2016-10-15 07:54:03	ciwolsey	i just reload the current scenne
2016-10-15 07:54:05	ciwolsey	it works fine before
2016-10-15 07:54:09	ciwolsey	and after, its all broken

2016-10-15 07:54:24	DooblyNoobly	yeah but
2016-10-15 07:54:32	DooblyNoobly	you click clear and it goes away from console?
2016-10-15 07:54:37	ciwolsey	yeah
2016-10-15 07:54:43	DooblyNoobly	yeah I get heaps like that

2016-10-15 07:54:54	ciwolsey	okay?
2016-10-15 07:54:56	ciwolsey	i mean
2016-10-15 07:54:59	UnicornForest	ciwolsey: could be alot of things, a common one might be using some scripts marked with [ExecuteInEditMode] especially if you are not careful with whats in OnDisable or OnDestroy

2016-10-15 07:56:48	UnicornForest	does it happen if you swtich between two empty scenes?
2016-10-15 07:56:55	ciwolsey	Assett hunter
2016-10-15 07:57:01	ciwolsey	no
2016-10-15 07:57:09	ciwolsey	its directly related to the game objects
2016-10-15 07:57:12	ciwolsey	so for example
2016-10-15 07:57:27	ciwolsey	theres a spray can you can press down
2016-10-15 07:57:31	ciwolsey	and it plays a sound
2016-10-15 07:57:48	ciwolsey	so im just getting the AudioSource and .Start() and .Stop() on it
2016-10-15 07:57:53	ciwolsey	for the spray loop sound
2016-10-15 07:58:01	ciwolsey	So I'm doing like...
2016-10-15 07:58:12	ciwolsey	hangon ill gist it
2016-10-15 07:58:19	ciwolsey	because if i can work out how to fix it in one area
2016-10-15 07:58:23	ciwolsey	im sure i can fix it all

2016-10-15 07:59:14	ciwolsey	its fairly simple
2016-10-15 07:59:24	Zolden	Tripknotix: I just had an array of struct that describes a particle and contains coordinates and velosity vector. This array is being loaded in gpu and computed there. Visualization happens by drawing pixels on a texture, that is loaded to gpu as well through Structured Buffer class, that handles data transmission between compute shader and cpu memory
2016-10-15 07:59:52	ciwolsey	however on a simple reload of the scene, I get a null reference error for spraySound
2016-10-15 08:00:28	UnicornForest	ciwolsey: oh you are subscribing to events but never unsubcribing them, so the next time that event happens they subscription still exists but hte object is not there
2016-10-15 08:00:49	ciwolsey	hmm
2016-10-15 08:00:53	ciwolsey	but...
2016-10-15 08:01:00	ciwolsey	Surely the scene is completely unloaded?
2016-10-15 08:01:15	ciwolsey	And everythings reset?
2016-10-15 08:01:30	UnicornForest	try http://hastebin.com/ukayidexoy.cs
2016-10-15 08:01:44	ciwolsey	hmm
2016-10-15 08:01:50	ciwolsey	okay
2016-10-15 08:02:04	ciwolsey	but does this explain why the error relates to the AudioSource ?
2016-10-15 08:03:01	ciwolsey	Hangon I'll go try that

2016-10-15 08:03:48	UnicornForest	that is still weird and I'm not sure. But the audio system does run on a separate thread so maybe it is something related to that. But you really should unsubscribe to those events
2016-10-15 08:04:05	terravires	hey all, does anyone know how to track down another famously bad unity error/warring: Tangents are missing on test-scene[1][31]. Lightmapper needs both normals and tangents in Directional Lightmaps mode.
2016-10-15 08:04:05	terravires	UnityEditor.DockArea:OnGUI()
2016-10-15 08:04:10	ciwolsey	well
2016-10-15 08:04:17	ciwolsey	its not just audio im having problems with
2016-10-15 08:04:27	ciwolsey	theres a ton of components that become null
2016-10-15 08:04:44	ciwolsey	one of the Renderer components do
2016-10-15 08:04:53	terravires	It doesn't tell me what object(s), what shader are the source of the problem. I get 999+ of these warnings when trying to bake in unity4 (old project getting update)
2016-10-15 08:07:17	UnicornForest	terravires: thats a messy one in unity4, as a quick fix you can select all the source objects in the project view, then in the import inspector use the drop down to have unity generate the normals and tangets instead of trying to import them
2016-10-15 08:08:10	terravires	UnicornForest, I did that for most of the models I have in my project already.  It's finding something else... but what I don't know.
2016-10-15 08:08:22	 *	UnicornForest shurgs
2016-10-15 08:08:25	terravires	I think it might even be the terrain itself.
2016-10-15 08:09:55	terravires	yeah, seems the terrain is the source of them.

2016-10-15 08:10:23	Tripknotix	either due to the switch to scenemanager, or from properties not being used

2016-10-15 09:40:40	ratking	be aware that you should boil your code down to the essentials
2016-10-15 09:41:05	ratking	you can't change transform.up directly, but you can rotate the transform
2016-10-15 09:41:22	ratking	either by setting transform.rotation or transform.eulerAngles, or by using transform.Rotate()

2016-10-15 15:58:27	BadgerMeles	Probably can ignore my 'float,T' test. Was trying to get 'floatValue += health' to work, but that apparently isn't how it's done. Still building this whole thing out.
2016-10-15 15:59:45	BadgerMeles	Ultimately, it makes adding attributes stupidly easy. Build out abstracts for Float, MinMax, Bool, etc.
2016-10-15 15:59:46	SigilObscura	I'm still not really seeing it, maybe I'm missing something
2016-10-15 16:00:12	BadgerMeles	If I wasn't using generics, it wouldn't return the right object type in the parents.
2016-10-15 16:02:32	SigilObscura	oh, I get it now.  Looks like a very complex way to solve the problem you're solving :)
2016-10-15 16:03:56	BadgerMeles	Huh. I just removed all the generics, and.. it still worked. *boggle* Pretty sure in Java that'd not work. Or I'm just remembering everything wrong.
2016-10-15 16:05:34	BadgerMeles	Oh, nope. I had a typo.
2016-10-15 16:05:42	BadgerMeles	I was right the first time - it doesn't work without generics.
2016-10-15 16:06:41	BadgerMeles	So, yeah. Need generics for it to all work cleanly. Otherwise you get something like 'Cannot implictly cast type MinMaxFloat to Health'.
2016-10-15 16:06:56	BadgerMeles	When trying to do something like: health += 5f;
2016-10-15 16:13:20	SigilObscura	seems like by adding some implicit casts you could probably avoid the generics - I'd have to think about it a bit to be certain

2016-10-15 17:49:57	ratking	why don't you just count how many people are inside the trigger
2016-10-15 17:50:15	ratking	and decrement the counter when they leave, and only close the door when the counter gets to 0
2016-10-15 17:50:26	ratking	and that is really not hard
2016-10-15 17:50:26	zooms	its always different
2016-10-15 17:51:59	ratking	what is always different
2016-10-15 17:53:34	zooms	the amount of people going through the door
2016-10-15 17:53:47	zooms	i havn't wrote that type of code before how would that go
2016-10-15 17:54:23	ratking	by just having an integer that you increment in OnTriggerEnter and decrement in OnTriggerExit
2016-10-15 17:54:33	zooms	ok go on
2016-10-15 17:55:26	ratking	i won't type the code for you

2016-10-16 12:42:43	BadgerMeles	I'm familiar with A*, but not in an *actual* 3d space. I imagine it's relatively similar, just checking grids in an additional axis as well (and takes longer to process).

2016-10-16 12:43:45	fholm	as in, i would not do any pathfinding, but rather build an AI that can avoid local obstacles infront of it
2016-10-16 12:44:58	BadgerMeles	Not doing a space game, but gave 3 similar examples. My specific scenario, at the moment, is water. I want to have swimming mobs.
2016-10-16 12:45:37	fholm	you have a normal A pathfinding solution for land, and getting "into" water, and then use simple obstacle avoidance for the underwater world
2016-10-16 12:45:37	fholm	i would say
2016-10-16 12:46:18	BadgerMeles	Some mobs would exist *only* in water, so unable to go up onto land. -- How would you handle 'forks in the road'?

2016-10-16 12:47:02	BadgerMeles	Where the object being avoided, doesn't really ever end.. so if the ai chooses the wrong direction to 'go around' it.. it never would.

2016-10-16 12:47:47	BadgerMeles	Or find a package, but yeah.
2016-10-16 12:47:58	fholm	 yeah
2016-10-16 12:48:04	fholm	build your own
2016-10-16 12:48:06	fholm	is probably the solution
2016-10-16 12:49:07	BadgerMeles	Good to know. I'll stick to land-based units, for now. Just to keep moving forward with some other things I want to play with. But now 'AI-navigation' is a big to-do on my list as well, sadly >;P

So resizing the title-bar, also resizes your usable-area.

2016-10-16 16:56:59	BadgerMeles	Downside, of course, if changes are made in the editor directly it won't trigger the events. But, in this scenario, I can live with that.
2016-10-16 16:57:53	BadgerMeles	In the example I provided, an 'Info Panel' that shows all the Skill information, would be attached to the events. So the panel would update itself if any information changed.

2016-10-16 18:17:44	SaraDT_	it's way over complicated, you could simply do:
2016-10-16 18:18:31	SaraDT_	Caching just means to save it in a variable, like: http://hastebin.com/umavucuziq.cpp
2016-10-16 18:19:07	SaraDT_	This is dangerous if you plan to change resolutions mid way through, so you should probably update it on screen size change, if you allow/do that.

2016-10-16 20:43:51	BadgerMeles	... and again I forgot to put some notes on how to use it. Hahah. Ohwell. If I make another code change.
2016-10-16 20:44:23	DooblyNoobly	looks pretty straight forward
2016-10-16 20:45:45	BadgerMeles	Yeah. The only annoyance is, if you want a control handle for all 8 directions, you have to specify the min/max on every single one of them. While sometimes that might be desirable, most scenarios it's annoying.
2016-10-16 20:45:46	samlo	DooblyNoobly yeah that should mean you're allocating some GC
2016-10-16 20:46:15	samlo	honestly the best way to handle GC in Unity is just to anticipate it and call System.GC.Collect when it isn't noticeable
2016-10-16 20:46:36	DooblyNoobly	yeah I do that on my load screen samlo

2016-10-16 20:46:57	DooblyNoobly	I’ve pretty much found all my GC allocs
2016-10-16 20:47:00	samlo	if its a very low amount you can even call it during gameplay and it won't hitch
2016-10-16 20:47:19	DooblyNoobly	I haven’t been object pooling tho
2016-10-16 20:47:20	samlo	depends on platform of course, PS4 is way more sensitive than android for whatever reason
2016-10-16 20:47:25	DooblyNoobly	so I have to create one for my bullets / scores etc
2016-10-16 20:47:30	samlo	oh pooling is the shit
2016-10-16 20:47:37	BadgerMeles	If I could figure out a clean way to put all the code into one singular 'Panel' class, for scale/move/close/etc, I would.. but I don't know how to have the handles, direct their On* methods to the main Panel script. NGUI used to have a Forward event thing, I could try and fake that.. but dunno how efficient it would be.
2016-10-16 20:47:40	samlo	i have a generic pooling script you can just use if you want

2016-10-16 20:48:15	BadgerMeles	Ideally I'd like to just have a Panel component, you can drag handles onto, and it would automatically know what to do though. Without having to add anything to the handles themselves.
2016-10-16 20:48:16	DooblyNoobly	yes pleaseee
2016-10-16 20:48:19	DooblyNoobly	that will save me some time

2016-10-16 20:49:43	DooblyNoobly	cool thanks
2016-10-16 20:49:47	fleshtheworld	Unity does not allows users to define button combinations in the input setting? How else can i create customizable buttons?
2016-10-16 20:49:53	DooblyNoobly	going to implement a pool later today
2016-10-16 20:50:10	samlo	fleshtheworld get InControl or Rewired (I use Rewired)

2016-10-16 20:51:24	fleshtheworld	well i want to be able to define combined buttons and not just 1 button input
2016-10-16 20:52:12	samlo	well those third party solutions are good for that too, where like two held buttons is a different input or something
2016-10-16 20:52:57	samlo	but it's also easy to code , if(Input.GetButton("ButtonName1") && Input.GetButton("ButtonName2")){
2016-10-16 20:53:10	samlo	where the names are just whatever buttons you want to combine
2016-10-16 20:53:30	fleshtheworld	yes, but the whole point of the input setting is to allow users to redefine it without coding.
2016-10-16 20:53:55	fleshtheworld	isnt it. i mean for when other people play the game
2016-10-16 20:54:06	samlo	oh, well then like i said originally you'll want to get Rewired or some other third party thing. Unity's default input is really obtuse to use for that

2016-10-16 20:54:47	fleshtheworld	yeah not being able to create bottun combination is quite limited
2016-10-16 20:55:00	samlo	fleshtheworld yeah it does not allow for remapping really
2016-10-16 20:55:24	samlo	you can do it but you basically have to create a separate input parameter for every button that could have that action
2016-10-16 20:56:22	samlo	fleshtheworld even with a third party solution you'll still have to code storing your players' input configurations, though. it's just way simpler to work with

2016-10-16 23:55:00	DooblyNoobly	hmm ok, I guess my profile is not that bad now
2016-10-16 23:55:09	DooblyNoobly	it was really bad yesterday

2016-10-17 02:42:46	DooblyNoobly	I think it returns a class
2016-10-17 02:43:08	DooblyNoobly	The MEC using System.Collections.Generic which returns a struct
2016-10-17 02:43:22	DooblyNoobly	So its more efficient in clean up
2016-10-17 02:43:38	DooblyNoobly	it probably does other things too, download it and have a look at the timing class

2016-10-17 07:18:00	at	the examples use int? and short? but the usage is the same

2016-10-17 07:18:36	hellyeah	good one i have forgotten nullable?
2016-10-17 07:18:38	wiliz	why do you need it to be "empty"? is it to know whether it has been assigned a value or not?
2016-10-17 07:18:40	hellyeah	good one i have forgotten nullable
2016-10-17 07:19:19	hellyeah	well you define int x = 0; string str = ""; i suppose you should define char as empty
2016-10-17 07:20:16	hellyeah	i mean initially you need to assign smt to variable right?
2016-10-17 07:20:17	at	with strings there's also String.Empty which can often be helpful

2016-10-17 07:23:49	hellyeah	i did
2016-10-17 07:24:21	hellyeah	char letter = Convert.ToChar(String.empty); there is no error about that. I didnt try it before. Does it make sense?
2016-10-17 07:25:29	hellyeah	:D
2016-10-17 07:25:36	at	can't say that makes much sense
2016-10-17 07:26:00	at	not that I know what it converts to, but char doesn't have a similar concept of "being empty"
2016-10-17 07:26:02	hellyeah	but it worked :D
2016-10-17 07:26:36	hellyeah	i just tried it i dont think it make sense but compiler doesnt complain about that. hmm
2016-10-17 07:27:09	bobross	hellyeah what are you with an empty character (there isn't such a thing as an empty character)
2016-10-17 07:28:06	at	it's pretty clear you're trying to do something that char isn't meant for
2016-10-17 07:28:07	hellyeah	well but it caused exception
2016-10-17 07:29:35	hellyeah	i try to create random sequence contain 12 character
2016-10-17 07:29:58	hellyeah	or more. For this i just select a char from a sequence and assign to a char variable.
2016-10-17 07:30:06	hellyeah	this is the reason i used "char"
2016-10-17 07:30:25	bobross	ok
2016-10-17 07:30:45	bobross	hellyeah why the 'empty' char ?
2016-10-17 07:30:48	hellyeah	i guess char is convenient for that purpose
2016-10-17 07:31:16	hellyeah	i didnt use "empty char" i used char letter = '\0';
2016-10-17 07:31:59	hellyeah	empty char is not possible
2016-10-17 07:34:21	wiliz	why is that not good enough?
2016-10-17 07:34:31	wiliz	the character 0
2016-10-17 07:34:43	hellyeah	it is good i suppose

2016-10-17 07:37:41	hellyeah	?
2016-10-17 07:39:10	at	yes

2016-10-17 07:41:36	neoclaw	Hi :) I have a problem with lightning in Unity 5.4.1. The spotlight on my character in this screenshot http://imgur.com/mXbkp8O is different in a build than in the editor. Any ideas on why?
2016-10-17 07:42:06	neoclaw	the "gradient" is behaving strange
2016-10-17 07:45:40	bobross	neoclaw what happens if you put another light there or strip it way down to a basic example?
2016-10-17 07:46:00	wiliz	could be linear vs gamma color space
2016-10-17 07:46:35	neoclaw	we are using linear color space, and deferred rendering on all cameras
2016-10-17 07:47:20	wiliz	left side looks linear, right side less so
2016-10-17 07:47:53	neoclaw	but it's the same settings :/
2016-10-17 07:48:33	neoclaw	bobross, hmm.. good question
2016-10-17 07:48:37	bobross	is the problem that the shadow on the guy is moving or that the shading on the ground is different?
2016-10-17 07:49:18	neoclaw	on the ground
2016-10-17 07:51:00	neoclaw	we just tried to turn off all other light sources in that area, and the same thing happens

2016-10-17 07:53:16	wiliz	I didn't suggest to do anything!
2016-10-17 07:53:26	neoclaw	exactly...
2016-10-17 07:53:30	neoclaw	:)
2016-10-17 07:53:43	wiliz	I don't know why there would be a discrepancy, but I've seen it happen in some contexts
2016-10-17 07:53:45	bobross	neoclaw alright, I would look into gamma vs linear
2016-10-17 07:54:02	wiliz	sometimes because of unity bugs
2016-10-17 07:54:12	wiliz	sometimes because it's just designed that wya
2016-10-17 07:54:13	wiliz	way
2016-10-17 07:54:36	bobross	unity's texture handling is very finnicky, there are almost definitely bugs
2016-10-17 07:55:00	neoclaw	could it be some kind of texture import settings?
2016-10-17 07:55:13	bobross	I have textures flop back and forth with their settings when changing a different texture's import settings
2016-10-17 07:55:27	bobross	neoclaw it could be worth a look sure
2016-10-17 07:56:13	neoclaw	hmm yeah, i can give it a try

2016-10-17 08:02:37	wiliz	https://docs.unity3d.com/400/Documentation/Images/manual/LinearLighting-0.jpg I mean just look at this. it looks very much like your difference
2016-10-17 08:04:06	neoclaw	that is true.. but if I set my project to linear should the editor also use that setting? i belive so
2016-10-17 08:04:50	wiliz	if you change between gamma and linear, is there a visible difference in the editor?
2016-10-17 08:05:03	Pas-2	neoclaw: its because it is facing different direction? ;)
2016-10-17 08:05:10	wiliz	and is there a difference in a build?
2016-10-17 08:05:39	neoclaw	wiliz, yeah a huge difference

2016-10-17 08:32:03	Seppy	at any rate, unity have some video tutorials that will help but won't give you a particularly in depth understanding, unless that's changed recently. If you're not satisfied with the offerings unity give, you need to pick up a book like "C# in a nutshell" published by o'reilly, or start looking at msdn's C# programming guide.
