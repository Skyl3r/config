2017-08-24 13:24:34	keveloper	this dude has a masters
2017-08-24 13:24:39	keveloper	or is about to
2017-08-24 13:24:40	keveloper	but
2017-08-24 13:24:42	keveloper	grad student
2017-08-24 13:24:57	treeford	why do we keep interviewing all these grad students
2017-08-24 13:25:14	treeford	grad students are full of knowledge you dont need to write web apps
2017-08-24 13:25:24	keveloper	because rashmi thinks indian schools are better so only looks for indian applicants and indian immigrants have to have a masters to get a better visa
2017-08-24 13:25:34	treeford	ah
2017-08-24 13:25:44	keveloper	from nathan
2017-08-24 13:25:45	treeford	i forgot the masters helped with you visa
2017-08-24 13:25:47	keveloper	yheah
2017-08-24 13:25:58	keveloper	with bachelors the company has to prove they can't hire a citizen instead
2017-08-24 13:26:02	keveloper	but with masters thats not the case
2017-08-24 13:26:20	keveloper	so the only reason we are looking at masters students (who are all bad) is because they are indian
2017-08-24 13:26:28	keveloper	well immigrants rather
2017-08-24 13:26:38	keveloper	all citizen applicants have been bachelor
2017-08-24 13:26:50	keveloper	and one of them was amazing except he said he didn't want to work overtime without gettin gpaid
2017-08-24 13:26:57	keveloper	so
2017-08-24 13:27:06	treeford	:o
2017-08-24 13:27:09	treeford	how dare he
2017-08-24 13:27:13	keveloper	but yeah apparently rashmi said something to nathan about indian scohols being better idk
2017-08-24 13:27:21	keveloper	but yeah masters students are normally bad
2017-08-24 13:27:25	treeford	i could see her saying that
2017-08-24 13:27:27	keveloper	at least for htis
2017-08-24 13:27:39	keveloper	we've seen a few decent ones
2017-08-24 13:27:43	treeford	Masters students seem to want a good job more than they want to write code
2017-08-24 13:28:05	keveloper	nathan is really confused because the only people they are interviewing are indian immigrants who did undergrad in india and masters here
2017-08-24 13:28:13	keveloper	which definitely does not match who is applying
2017-08-24 13:28:22	keveloper	but nobody sees the applicants to interview except rashmi
2017-08-24 13:28:48	treeford	i wish i had good referrals
2017-08-24 13:28:54	keveloper	i could go get a better qualified person from capital in 1 day of going there and talking to the director
2017-08-24 13:29:12	keveloper	yeah its very sketchy and weird
2017-08-24 13:29:37	keveloper	also liz was talking about how they cant justify rellocating all these people
2017-08-24 13:29:46	keveloper	rashmi isn't looking locally for developers
2017-08-24 13:29:50	keveloper	and hr is mad
2017-08-24 13:30:05	keveloper	so if you're confused why we haven't found anybody those are the reasons lol
2017-08-24 13:30:09	keveloper	very frustrating
2017-08-24 13:30:25	treeford	that is really frustrating
2017-08-24 13:30:27	keveloper	yeah
2017-08-24 13:30:33	keveloper	nathan is pretty annoyed about
2017-08-24 13:30:38	keveloper	goes with out saying but dont share this :P
2017-08-24 13:30:51	treeford	üëç
2017-08-24 13:31:18	keveloper	but yeah im frustrated
2017-08-24 13:31:56	keveloper	kinda wanna find someone to refer
2017-08-24 13:32:10	keveloper	i have good connections with the director at capital and he is very aware of who is good
2017-08-24 13:32:24	keveloper	only thing is that it'd be in may
2017-08-24 13:32:46	keveloper	but hey everyone i've referred has gotten hired \o/
